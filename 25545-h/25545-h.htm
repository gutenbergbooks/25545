projects. These links may be found within each Bibliography. If Gutenberg has
the book, then clicking on the title will take the reader to the page for that book.
At times, collections of books were mentioned and, for these instances, the link
will take the reader to the list of the author instead of an individual project

<p>When all the novelists and spinners of elaborate fictions have
been read and judged, we shall find that the peasant and the nurse
are still unsurpassed as mere narrators. They are the guardians of
that treasury of legend which comes to us from the very childhood
of nations; they and their tales are the abstract and brief chronicles,
not of an age merely, but of the whole race of man. It is theirs to
keep alive the great art of telling stories as a thing wholly apart
from and independent of the art of writing stories, and to pass on
their art to children and to children's children. They abide in a
realm of their own, in blessed isolation from that world of professional
authors and their milk-and-water books "for children."</p></div>

<h2>CHILDREN'S LITERATURE</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>SECTION I. PREFACE AND GENERAL INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>THE PREFACE</h3>

<p>This book is primarily a handbook for teachers in the grades and for students
preparing to teach in the grades. Although it does not ignore problems of grading
and presentation, the chief purpose is to acquaint teachers and prospective teachers
with standard literature of the various kinds suitable for use in the classroom and
to give them information regarding books and authors to aid them in directing the
selection of books by and for children.</p>

<p>In discussing the early training of children in literature with large classes of young
people preparing for teaching in the grades, the compilers found themselves face to
face with two difficulties. In the first place, only a limited number of these prospective
teachers were in any real sense acquainted with what may be called the basic
traditional material. Rhymes, fables, myths, stories were so vaguely and indistinctly
held in mind that they were practically of no great value. It was therefore not
possible to assume much real acquaintance with the material needed for use with
children, and the securing of such an acquaintance seemed the first essential. After
all is said, a discussion of ways and means must follow such a mastery of basic material.</p>

<p>In the second place, there was the difficulty of finding in any compact form a
body of material sufficient in extent and wide enough in its range to serve as a satisfactory
basis for such a course. No doubt the ideal way would be to send the student
to the many authoritative volumes covering the various fields dealt with in this
collection. But with large classes and a limited amount of time such a plan was
hardly practicable. The young teacher cannot be much of a specialist in any of the
various fields of knowledge with the elements of which he is expected to acquaint
children. The principles of economy demand that the brief courses which specifically
prepare for teaching should be such as will make the work in the schoolroom most
helpful and least wasteful from the very beginning. Hence this attempt to collect
in one volume what may somewhat roughly be spoken of as material for a minimum
basic course in Children's Literature.</p>

<p>The important thing about this book, then, is the actual literary material included
in it. The notes and suggestions scattered throughout are aimed to direct attention
to this material either in the way of pointing out the sources of it, or helping in the
understanding and appreciation of it, or suggesting some ways of presenting it most
effectively to children.</p>

<p>In the case of folk material, an effort has been made to present reliable versions
of the stories used. Many of the folk stories, for instance, appear in dozens of collections
and in dozens of forms, according to the artistic or pedagogic biases of the
various compilers. As a rule the most accessible stories are found in versions written<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
down to the supposed needs of children, and intended to be read by the children
themselves. Even if we grant the teacher the right to make extensive modifications,
it is still reasonable to insist that some correct traditional form be used as the starting
point. Such a plan insures a mastery of one's material. The sources of the
versions used in this text are pointed out in order that teachers who wish to do so
may extend their acquaintance to other folk material by referring to the various
collections mentioned.</p>

<p>Such a book as this must necessarily be selective. No doubt omissions will be
noted of poems or stories that many teachers deem indispensable. Others will find
selections included that to their minds are questionable. The editors can only plead
in extenuation that they have included what they have found by experience to offer
a sound basis for discussing with training classes the nature of this basic material
and the form in which it should be presented to children. To accomplish these ends
it has sometimes seemed well to give parallel versions, and occasionally to give a
version that will necessitate the discussion of such subjects as the use of dialect, the
inclusion of items of terror or horror, and the soundness of the ethical appeal. These
various problems are indicated in the notes accompanying individual selections.</p>

<p>The editorial apparatus does not constitute a treatise on literary criticism, or
a manual of mythology or folklore, or a "pedagogy" of children's literature as such,
or anything like an exhaustive bibliography of the fields of study touched upon. It
aims at the very modest purpose of immediate and practical utility. It hopes to
fill a place as a sort of first aid for the inexperienced teacher, and as soon as the teacher
gets some real grasp of the elements of the problem this book must yield to the more
elaborate and well-knit discussions of specialists in the various subjects treated.
The bibliographical references throughout are intended to offer help in this forward
step. These bibliographies are, in all cases, frankly selective. As a rule most of
the books mentioned are books now in print. In the bibliographies connected with
the sections of traditional material some of the more important works in the field
of scholarship are named in each case for the benefit of those who may be working
where such books are available in institutional or public libraries. Titles of books
are printed in italics, while titles of poems, separate stories, and selections are printed
in roman type inclosed in quotation marks.</p>

<p>The grouping of material is in no sense a hard and fast one. Those who work
in literary fields understand the pitfalls that beset one who attempts such a classification.
Only a general grouping under headings used in the ordinary popular
sense has been made. Fine distinctions are beside the mark in such a book as this.
Popular literature was not made for classification, but for higher purposes, and anything
that draws attention from the pleasure-giving and spirit-invigorating qualities
of the literature itself should be avoided. Hence, the classifications adopted are as
simple and unobtrusive as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, the editors make no pretense to original scholarship. They have not
attempted to extend the limits of human knowledge, but to point out pleasant paths
leading to the limitless domains of literature. They have tried to reflect accurately
the best practices and theories, or to point out how teachers may get at the best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Their obligations to others are too extended to be noted in a preface, but will
be apparent on every page of the text. Their most important lessons have come
from the reactions secured from hundreds of teachers who have been under their
tuition.</p>

<p>Copyright obligations are indicated in connection with the selections used.</p>


<h2>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</h2>


<h3><br />1. LITERATURE FOR CHILDREN</h3>

<p><i>The beginnings.</i> During the eighteenth century the peoples of Europe and
America turned their attention in a remarkable way to a consideration of the worth
and rights of the individual. In America this so-called democratic movement
culminated in the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The most dramatic manifestation
of the movement in Europe was the French Revolution of 1789, but every
country of Europe was thrilled and changed by the new thought. Every important
democratic movement leads to an awakened interest in the welfare of children, for
they are among the weak and helpless. This great movement of the eighteenth
century brought such a remarkable change of thought regarding children as to mark
the beginning of a new kind of literature, known as literature for children.</p>

<p>Today we think of Andersen, Stevenson, Mrs. Ewing, and scores of others as
writers of literature for children. Such writers did not exist before the democratic
movement of the eighteenth century. It is true that a few short books and articles
had been written for children as early as the fifteenth century, but they were written
to teach children to be obedient and respectful to parents and masters or to instruct
them in the customs of the church&mdash;they were not written primarily to entertain
children and give them pleasure. Within the last century and a half, too, many
authors have collected and retold for children innumerable traditional stories from
all parts of the earth&mdash;traditional fairy stories, romantic stories of the Middle
Ages, legends, and myths.</p>

<p><i>The child's inheritance.</i> As has been indicated, children's literature is of two
kinds: first, the traditional kind that grew up among the folk of long ago in the forms
of rhyme, myth, fairy tale, fable, legend, and romantic hero story; and, second, the
kind that has been produced in modern times by individual authors. The first, the
traditional kind, was produced by early civilization and by the childlike peasantry of
long ago. The best of the stories produced by the childhood of the race have been
bequeathed to the children of today, and to deprive children of the pleasure they
would get from this inheritance of folklore seems as unjust as to deprive them of
traditional games, which also help to make the first years of a person's life, the period
of childhood, the period of imaginative play. The second kind of children's literature,
that produced in modern times by individual authors, has likewise been bequeathed
to children. Some of it is so new that its worth has not been determined, but some
of it has passed the test of the classics. The best of both kinds is as priceless as is
the classical literature for adults. The world would not sell Shakespeare; yet one
may well doubt that Shakespeare is worth as much to humanity as is Mother Goose.
To evaluate truly the worth of such classics is impossible; but we may be assured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that the child who has learned to appreciate the pleasures and the beauties of Mother
Goose is the one most likely to appreciate the pleasures and the beauties of Shakespeare
when the proper time comes.</p>

<p>The true purpose of education is to bring the child into his inheritance. For
many years educators have talked about the use of literature <i>in</i> the grades as one
means of accomplishing this purpose. The results of attempts to teach literature
in the grades have sometimes been disappointing because often the literature used
has not been <i>for</i> the grades; that is, it has not been children's literature. In other
cases the attempts have failed because the literature has not been presented as
literature&mdash;it has, for example, been presented as reading lessons or composition
assignments. Students preparing to teach in the grades have been studying textbooks
from which literature for children has been excluded, regardless of its artistic
worth. Consequently many teachers have not been prepared to teach literature in
the grades. Often they have assumed that the reading lesson would develop in the
pupil an appreciation of good literature, not realizing that the reading lesson may
cause pupils to dislike literature, especially poetry, unless it is supplemented by
appropriate work in children's literature. If the student reads thoughtfully the
literary selections in the following sections of this book, he probably will realize
that children's literature is also literature for adults, and that it is not only the child's
inheritance, but also the inheritance of humanity.</p>

<p>The fact that literature for children is likely to have a strong interest for adults
is strikingly suggested in a few sentences in John Macy's <i>A Child's Guide to Reading:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When "juveniles" are really good, parents read them after children have gone to bed.
I do not know whether <i>Tom Brown at Rugby</i> is catalogued by the careful librarian as a book
for boys, but I am sure it is a book for men. I dare say that a good many pairs of eyes that
have passed over the pages of Mr. John T. Trowbridge and Elijah Kellogg and Louisa M.
Alcott have been old enough to wear spectacles. And if Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin ever
thought that in <i>Timothy's Quest</i> and <i>Rebecca</i> she was writing books especially for the young,
adult readers have long since claimed her for their own. I have enjoyed Mr. A. S. Pier's tales
of the boys at St. Timothy's, though he planned them for younger readers. We are told on
good authority that <i>St. Nicholas</i> and <i>The Youth's Companion</i> appear in households where
there are no children, and they give a considerable portion of their space to serial stories written
for young people. Between good "juveniles" and good books for grown persons there is
not much essential difference.</p></div>


<h3><br />2. LITERATURE IN THE GRADES</h3>

<p><i>Reading and literature distinguished.</i> A country school-teacher once abruptly
stopped the routine of daily work and, standing beside her desk, told the story of
the maid who counted her chickens before they were hatched. One of her pupils,
who is now a man, remembers vividly how the incident impressed him. Although
he was in the second grade, that was the first time he had known a teacher to stop
regular school work to tell a story. Immediately the teacher was transformed.
She had been merely a teacher, one of those respected, awe-inspiring creatures whose
business it is to make the school mill go; but the magic of her story established the
relation of friendship between teacher and pupil. She was no longer merely a teacher.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
If the story had been read as a part of the reading lesson, it would not have impressed
the pupil greatly. It was impressive because it was presented as literature.</p>

<p>A clear distinction should be made between reading and literature, especially
in the primary grades. In the work of the reading course the pupil should take the
lead, being guided by the teacher. If the pupil is to progress, he must master the
mechanics of reading&mdash;he must learn to pronounce printed words and to get the
meaning of printed sentences and paragraphs. The course in reading requires
patient work on the part of the pupil, just as the course in arithmetic does, and the
chief pleasure that the primary pupil can derive from the work is a consciousness of
enlarged power and of success in accomplishing what is undertaken.</p>

<p>In the work with literature, however, the teacher should take the lead. She
should open to the pupils the magic treasure house of the world's best story and
song. The literature period of the day should be the pupil's imaginative play
period, bringing relief from the tension of tired nerves. The teacher who makes
the study of literature a mechanical grind instead of a joyous exercise of imagination
misses at least two of her greatest opportunities as a teacher. First, by failing to
cultivate in her pupils an appreciation of good literature, she misses an opportunity
to make the lives of her pupils brighter and happier. Second, by failing to realize
that the person with a story and a song is everybody's friend, she misses an opportunity
to win the friendship, admiration, and love of her pupils. The inexperienced
teacher who is well-nigh distracted in her efforts to guide forty restless, disorderly
pupils through the program of a day's work might charm half her troubles away
by the magic of a simple story or by the music and imagery of a juvenile poem. Her
story or poem would do more than remove the cause of disorder by giving the pupils
relaxation from nerve-straining work: it would help to establish that first essential
to all true success in teaching&mdash;a relation of friendship between pupils and teacher.</p>

<p><i>Culture through literature.</i> He was a wise educator who said, "The boy who has
access to good books and who has learned to make them his close friends is beyond
the power of evil." Literature in the grades, in addition to furnishing intellectual
recreation, should so cultivate in the pupil the power of literary appreciation that
he will make good books his close friends. The child who has heard good music
from infancy is not likely to be attracted by popular ragtime. The boy who has
been trained in habits of courtesy, industry, and pure thinking in his home life, and
school life is not likely to find pleasure in the rudeness, idleness, and vulgarity of the
village poolroom. The pupil who is taught to appreciate the beautiful, the true,
and the good in standard literature is not likely to find pleasure in reading the melodramatic
and sentimental trash that now has prominence of place and space in many
book stores and in some public libraries. It is the duty of the teacher, and it should
be her pleasure, to cultivate in her pupils such a taste for good literature as will lead
them to choose the good and reject the bad, a taste that will insure for them the
culture that good literature gives.</p>

<p><i>Selection of material.</i> In choosing selections of literary worth to present to her
pupils, the teacher should keep in mind the pupil's stage of mental development
and she should not forget that the study of literature should give pleasure. Often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
pupils do not like what moral writers think they should like, and usually the pupils
are right. Good literature is sincere and is true in its appeal to the fundamental
emotions of humanity, and an obvious attempt to teach a moral theory at the expense
of truth is no more to be tolerated in literature for children than in literature for
adults. The childhood of the race has produced much literature with a true appeal
to the human heart, in the form of fable, fairy story, myth, and hero story. Most
of this literature appeals strongly to the child of today. For several hundred years
the nursery rhymes of "Mother Goose" have delighted children with their melody,
humor, and imagery. As literature for the kindergarten and first grade, they have
not often been excelled by modern writers. The task of selecting suitable material
from the many poems, stories, and books written for children in recent years is
difficult, but if the teacher has a keen appreciation of good literature and is guided
by the likes and dislikes of her pupils, she probably will not go far astray.</p>

<p><i>Supplemental reading.</i> If the teacher examines the juvenile books offered for
sale by the book dealers of her town or city, she probably will discover that most
of them are trash not fit to be read by anyone, and she will realize the importance
of directing parents in the selection of gift books for children. A good way to get
better books into the book stores and into the hands of children is to give the pupils
a list of good books, with the suggestion that they ask their parents to buy one of
them the next time a book is to be bought as a present. Such lists of books also
will improve the standard of books in the town library, for librarians will be quick
to realize the importance of supplying standard literature if there is a demand for it.</p>


<h3><br />3. STORY-TELLING AND DRAMATIZATION</h3>

<p><i>Story-telling.</i> Most stories are much more effective when well told than they
are when read, just as most lectures and sermons are most effective when delivered
without manuscript. To explain just why the story well told is superior to the
story read might not be easy, but much of the superiority probably comes from the
freedom of the "talk style" and the more appropriate use of inflection and emphasis.
Then, too, the story-teller can look at her audience and is free to add a descriptive
word or phrase occasionally to produce vividness of impression. Some stories, of
course, are so constructed that they must follow closely the diction of the original
form. "Henny-Penny" and Kipling's <i>Just-So Stories</i> are of this type. Such stories
should be read. Most stories, however, are most effective when well told. The
teacher, especially the teacher of one of the primary grades, should not consider
herself prepared to teach literature until she has gained something of the art of
story-telling.</p>

<p><i>Selection of stories.</i> Never attempt to tell a story that you do not like. You
are not prepared to interest pupils in a story, however appropriate it otherwise may
be, if you are not interested in it yourself. Try to choose stories adapted in structure
and content to the age and experience of the children of your grade. For the first
or second grade, choose a few simple fables, a few short, simple fairy tales, and a few
short, simple nature stories, such as "Peter Rabbit," "How Johnny Chuck Finds
the Best Thing in the World," and "Mr. 'Possum's Sick Spell." Remember that a
story for the first or second grade should be short.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Two principles.</i> Learn to apply readily the following principles of method:
First, use the past tense in telling a story except in direct quotation. The rules of
grammar require this, and it is an aid to clearness and effectiveness. For example,
do not say, "So he goes" or "Then he says"; but say, "So he went" or "Then he
said" (or, for variety, <i>replied</i>, <i>growled</i>, <i>mumbled</i>, etc.). Second, use direct discourse
(the exact words of the characters) rather than indirect discourse. For example,
do not say, "The Troll asked who was tripping over his bridge"; but say, "'WHO'S
THAT tripping over my bridge?' roared the Troll." Direct discourse always gives
life and vividness to a story.</p>

<p><i>Preparation and presentation.</i> When you have selected a suitable story, read
it carefully several times to learn the essential details and the order in which they
should come. Keep in mind the fact that you are to use the past tense and direct
discourse. If the story is a fable, you probably will see that you should add much
conversation and description not in the text. A little description of the witch, giant,
fairy, or castle may give vividness to your story. If the story is a long fairy tale, you
may see that many details may be omitted. If the story is as concise and dramatic as
is the version of "The Three Billy-Goats Gruff" in this book, it may be suitable for
presentation without any changes. When you have the story clearly in mind as you
wish to present it, tell it to the pupils several times, and then have some of them tell it.</p>

<p>Your story, of course, should not be told in a lifeless monotone. Some parts
should be told slowly, and others rapidly. In some parts the voice should be low
and soft, while in other parts it should be loud and gruff or harsh. The words of
the princess should not sound like those of the old witch or the soldier. The daintiness
and grace of elves and fairies should be indicated in the delivery.</p>

<p><i>Corroborative opinion.</i> The many books on the art of story-telling by skilled
practitioners and the emphasis placed upon the great practical value of story-telling
by all those charged with the oversight of the education of children show conclusively
that the story method in teaching is having its grand renascence. The English
education minister, Mr. H. A. L. Fisher, speaking recently on the subject of "History
Teaching," set forth admirably the general principles back of this revival:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is no difficulty about interesting children. The real difficulty is to bore them.
Almost any tale will interest a child. It need not be well constructed or thrilling; it may be
filled with the most unexciting and trivial incidents, but so long as it carries the mind along
at all, it will interest a child. The hunger which intelligent children have for stories is almost
inexhaustible. They like to have their stories repeated, and insist that the characters should
reappear over and over again, for they have an appetite for reality and a desire to fix these
passing figments into the landscape of the real life with which they are surrounded.</p>

<p>One of the great qualities in childhood which makes it apt for receiving historical impressions
is just this capacity for giving body to the phantoms of the mind. The limits between
the real and the legendary or miraculous which are drawn by the critical intelligence do not
exist for the childish mind.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It would then be a great educational disaster if this valuable
faculty in childhood were allowed to run to waste. There are certain years in the development
of every normal intelligent child when the mind is full of image-making power and eager
to make a friend or enemy of any god, hero, nymph, fairy, or servant maid who may come
along. Then is the time when it is right and fitting to affect some introductions to the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
characters of mythology and history; that is the age at which children will eagerly absorb
what they can learn of Achilles and Orpheus, of King Arthur and his Knights, of Alexander
and Christopher Columbus and the Duke of Wellington. I do not think it is necessary to
obtrude any moralizing commentary when these great and vague images are first brought
into the landscape of the child's intellectual experience. A little description, a few stories,
a picture or two, will be enough to fix them in the memory and to give them body and shape
together with the fairies and witches and pirate kings and buccaneering captains with whom
we have all at one time been on such familiar terms. Let us then begin by teaching the past
to small children by way of stories and pictures.</p></div>

<p><i>Dramatization.</i> The play spirit that leads children to play lady, doctor, church,
and school will also lead them to enjoy dramatizing stories, or "playing the stories,"
as they call it. Some stories, of course, are so lacking in action as to be not well
suited for dramatization, and others have details of action, character, or situation
that may not well be represented in the schoolroom. The teacher may be surprised,
however, to see how ingenious her pupils are in overcoming difficulties after they
have had a little assistance in playing two or three stories. Unconsciously the pupil
will get from the dramatization a training in oral English, reading, and literary
appreciation that can hardly be gained in any other way.</p>

<p>When the pupils have learned a story thoroughly, they are ready to make plans
for playing it. The stage setting may be considered first, and here the child's imagination
can work wonders in arranging details. The opening under the teacher's
desk may become a dungeon, a cave, a cellar, or a well. If a two-story house is
needed, it may be outlined on the floor in the front part of the schoolroom, with
a chalk-mark stairway, up which Goldilocks can walk to lie down on three coats&mdash;the
three beds in the bed-chamber of the three bears.</p>

<p>The pupils can probably soon decide what characters are necessary, but more
time may be required to assign the parts. To play the part of a spider, bear, wolf,
fairy, sheep, or butterfly does not seem difficult to a child who has entered into the
spirit of the play.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of dramatization may be the plan for conversation,
especially if the text version of the story contains little or no direct discourse. The
pupils should know the general nature of the conversation and action before they
begin to play the story, although they need not memorize the parts. Suppose that
the fable "The Shepherd's Boy" is to be dramatized. The first part of the dramatization
might be described about as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The shepherd boy, tending his flock of pupil-sheep in the pasture land at one
side of the teacher's-desk-mountain, looked toward the pupil-desk-village at
one side of the room and said quietly, "It certainly is lonely here. I believe
I'll make those villagers think a wolf has come to eat the sheep. Then perhaps
they'll come down here, and I'll have a little company and some excitement."
Then he jumped around frantically, waving his yardstick-shepherd's crook,
and shouted to the villagers, "Wolf! Wolf!"</p>

<p>The villagers came rushing down to the pasture land, asking excitedly,
"Where's the wolf? Has he killed many of the sheep?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh," laughed the boy, "there wasn't any wolf. I certainly did
fool you that time."</p>

<p>"I don't think that's very funny," said one of the villagers.</p>

<p>"Well, we might as well go back to our work," said another. Then they
went back to the village.</p>

<p>After they had gone, the boy said, "I guess I'll try that joke again."</p></div>

<p>If the teacher puts much direct discourse in a story of this kind when she tells
it to the pupils, the task of dramatizing will naturally be made easier.</p>

<p>Some stories lend themselves in the most natural manner to dramatization.
An interesting example of such a story may be found among the tales dealing with
the Wise Men of Gotham. These Wise Men are referred to in one of the best known
of the Mother Goose rhymes. It would seem that the inhabitants of Gotham, in
the reign of King John, had some reason of their own for pretending to be mad, and
out of this event the legends took their rise. The number of fishermen may be
changed to seven or some other number to suit the number in the acting group. Here
is the story:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On a certain time there were twelve men of Gotham that went to fish, and some stood on
dry land. And in going home, one said to the other "We have ventured wonderfully in wading.
I pray God that none of us come home to be drowned." "Nay, marry," said the other,
"let us see that, for there did twelve of us come out." Then they counted themselves, and
every one counted eleven. Said the one to the other, "There is one of us drowned." They
went back to the brook where they had been fishing and sought up and down for him that
was drowned, making great lamentation.</p>

<p>A stranger coming by asked what it was they sought for, and why they were sorrowful.
"Oh!" said they, "this day we went to fish in the brook; twelve of us came together, and one
is drowned." Said the stranger, "Tell how many there be of you." One of them, counting,
said, "Eleven," and again he did not count himself. "Well," said the stranger, "what will
you give me if I find the twelfth man?" "Sir," said they, "all the money we have got."
"Give me the money," said the stranger, and began with the first, and gave him a stroke
over the shoulders with his whip, which made him groan, saying, "Here is one," and so he served
them all, and they all groaned at the matter. When he came to the last he paid him well,
saying, "Here is the twelfth man." "God's blessing on thy heart," said they, "for thus finding
our dear brother."</p></div>


<h3><br />4. COURSES OF STUDY</h3>

<p>As an aid to inexperienced teachers, it seems well to suggest in a summary
how a selection of material suitable for each grade might be made from the material
of this book. The summary, however, should be regarded as suggestive in a general
way only. No detailed outline of a course of study in literature for the grades can
be ideal for all schools because the pupils of a given grade in one school may be much
more advanced in the knowledge of literature and the ability to understand and
appreciate it than are the pupils of the same grade in another school. Many literary
selections, too, might appropriately be taught in almost any grade if the method of
presentation in each case were suited to the understanding of the pupils. <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>, for example, may appropriately be told to second-grade pupils, or it may be
read by fourth- or fifth-grade pupils, or it may be studied as fiction by eighth-grade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
pupils or university students. All poems of remarkable excellence that are suitable
for primary pupils are also suitable for pupils in the higher grades and for adults, and
the same is true of many prose selections.</p>

<p>The summary that follows, then, is to be regarded as "first aid" to the untrained,
inexperienced teacher. The teacher's own personal likes and dislikes and her success
in presenting various literary selections should eventually lead her to modify any
prescribed course of study. If a teacher of the sixth grade discovers that her pupils
should rank only second grade in knowledge and appreciation of literature, she may
very properly begin with traditional fairy tales. Another outlined course of study
is given in <a href="#Page_677">Section XII</a> of this book.</p>

<p><i>First, second, and third grades.</i> Since pupils in the primary grades read with
difficulty if at all, the teacher should tell or read all selections presented as literature
in these grades.</p>

<p>No kind of prose is better suited for use in the primary grades than traditional
fairy tales. About half a dozen might well be presented in each of the three grades.
For the first grade, the simplest should be chosen, such as "The Old Woman and Her
Pig," "Teeny-Tiny," "The Cat and the Mouse," "The Three Pigs," "The Three
Bears," and "The Elves and the Shoemaker." As suitable stories for the second
grade, we might choose "The Three Sillies," "Little Red Riding-Hood," "Cinderella,"
"The Three Billy-Goats Gruff," "The Straw Ox," and "The Horned Women."
For the third grade, somewhat longer and more complex stories might be chosen.</p>

<p>About half a dozen fables might also be used appropriately in each of the primary
grades. Simple Aesopic fables in prose seem best for the first two grades. More
complex forms might be chosen for the third grade, for example, "The Story of
Alnaschar," "The Good Samaritan," "The Discontented Pendulum," "The Musical
Ass," "The Swan, the Pike, and the Crab," and "The Hen with the Golden Eggs."</p>

<p>Much of the nature literature of the primary grades may be in the form of verse,
but some simple nature prose may be used successfully. From the selections in this
book, "Peter Rabbit" should be chosen for the first grade, while "Johnny Chuck,"
and "Mr. 'Possum's Sick Spell" are appropriate for the second and third grades.</p>

<p>The simplest of Andersen's <i>Fairy Tales</i> may be used in the third grade, and perhaps
in the second. Some suitable stories are "The Real Princess," "The Fir Tree,"
"The Tinder Box," "The Hardy Tin Soldier," and "The Ugly Duckling."</p>

<p>The ideal verse for the first grade is nursery rhymes, which may be chosen
from the first 135 selections of this book. These may be supplemented by such
simple verse as "The Three Kittens," "The Moon," "Ding Dong," "The Little
Kitty," "Baby Bye," "Time to Rise," "Rain," "I Like Little Pussy," and "The
Star." In the second and third grades, traditional verses from those following
Number 135 in <a href="#Page_17">Section II</a> may be used. The poems by Stevenson are ideal for these
grades, and those by Field, Sherman, and Christina Rossetti are good. In addition
the teacher might select such poems as "The Brown Thrush," and "Who Stole
the Bird's Nest."</p>

<p><i>Fourth, fifth, and sixth grades.</i> Although pupils in these intermediate grades
may be expected to read some library books, the teacher should read and tell stories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
frequently, for this is the surest way to develop in the pupil a taste for good literature.
The teacher should remember, too, that the story she recommends to the pupils as
suitable reading should be about two grades easier than those told or read by the
teacher. Probably every poem presented as literature in these grades should be read
or recited by the teacher because pupils are not likely to get the charm of rhythm,
melody, and rhyme if they do the reading. Pupils who dislike poetry are pupils
who have not heard good poetry well read.</p>

<p>Myths are appropriate for each of the intermediate grades. Most teachers
prefer for the fourth grade the simpler classical myths, such as "A Story of Springtime,"
"The Miraculous Pitcher," "The Narcissus," and "The Apple of Discord."
In the fifth grade, the teacher may use the more difficult classical myths, reserving
the Norse myths for the sixth grade.</p>

<p>Modern fairy and fantastic stories are also appropriate for each of these grades.
Suitable stories for the fourth grade are "The Four-Leaved Clover," "The Emperor's
New Clothes," "The Nightingale," and "The Story of Fairyfoot." Stories appropriate
for the fifth grade are "The Happy Prince," "The Knights of the Silver Shield,"
and "The Prince's Dream." In the sixth grade, the teacher might use "Old Pipes
and the Dryad" and "The King of the Golden River."</p>

<p>Two or three symbolic stories or fables in verse from the last part of <a href="#Page_261">Section V</a>
should be used in each of these grades.</p>

<p>Nature prose should appeal more and more to children as they advance from
the fourth to the eighth grade. Many pupils in the fourth grade will enjoy reading
for themselves books by Burgess and Paine, while fifth- and sixth-grade pupils will
get much pleasure from the simpler books by Sharp, Seton, Long, Miller, and Roberts.
In the intermediate grades, the teacher may read such stories as "Wild Life in the
Farm Yard," "The Vendetta," "Pasha," "Moufflou," and "Bird Habits."</p>

<p>Stories of various other kinds may be read by the teacher in the intermediate
grades. "Goody Two-Shoes" and "Waste Not, Want Not," are suitable for the
fourth grade. The biographies "How Columbus Got His Ships" and "Boyhood of
Washington" are excellent in the fifth or sixth grade as an introduction to history
study, and the romance "Robin Hood and the Merry Little Old Woman" may be used
appropriately in any of these grades, especially if it is made to supplement a discussion
of the Norman conquest.</p>

<p>Most of the poems up to about No. <a href="#Note_342">342</a>, and a few beyond that, are within the
range of the work for these grades.</p>

<p><i>Seventh and eighth grades.</i> Although pupils in the seventh and eighth grades
may be expected to read simple narrative readily, the teacher should read to the
pupils frequently. It cannot be too much emphasized that reading aloud to children
is the surest way of developing an appreciation of the best in literature. In poetry
especially this is a somewhat critical time, as the pupil is passing from the simpler
and more concrete verse to that which has a more prominent thought content. The
persuasion of the reading voice smooths over many obstacles here. Outside the
field of poetry, the teacher's work in these grades is mainly one of guidance and
direction in getting the children and the right books in contact. Children at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
this period are likely to be omnivorous readers, ready for any book that comes their
way, and the job of keeping them supplied with titles of enough available good books
for their needs is indeed one to tax all a teacher's knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>The demand for highly sensational stories on the part of pupils in the upper
grades is so insistent that it constitutes a special problem for the teacher. It is a
perfectly natural demand, and no wise teacher will attempt to stifle it. Such an
attempt would almost certainly result in a more or less surreptitious reading of a mass
of unwholesome books which have come to be known as "dime novels." Instead of
trying to thwart this desire for the thrilling story the teacher should be ready to
recommend books which have all the attractive adventure features of the "dime
novel," and which have in addition sound artistic and ethical qualities. While many
such books are mentioned in the bibliographies in the latter part of this text, it has
seemed well to bring together here a short list of those which librarians over the
country have found particularly fitted to serve as substitutes for the dime novel.</p>

<h2>SECTION II. MOTHER GOOSE JINGLES AND NURSERY RHYMES</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p><i>A flawless literature.</i> The one literature that is supremely adapted to its purpose
is the collection of rhymes associated with Mother Goose. To every child it
comes with an irresistible appeal. It has a power so natural and fundamental that
it defies explanation. The child takes it for granted just as he does his parents. It
has a perfection of rhythm and structure not attainable by modern imitators. It
has been perfected through the generations by the surest of all tests, that of constant
popular use. Much of it is common to many different nations. It is an international
literature of childhood. While much of it is known to children long before they enter
school, these jingles, like all folk literature, never lose their charm through repetition.
The schools have long since learned the value of the familiar in teaching. The
process of learning to read is usually based on some of the better known rhymes.
Teachers of literature in more advanced classes think they can generally detect the
students who have been especially "learned" in "Mother Goose her ways" by their
quick responsiveness to the facts of verbal rhythm and rhythmical structure in
more sophisticated products. "If we have no love for poetry to-day, it may not
impossibly be due to the fact that we have ceased to prize the old, old tales which have
been the delight of the child and the child-man since the foundations of the world.
If you want your child to love Homer, do not <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'withold'">withhold</ins> Mother Goose."</p>

<p><i>Who was Mother Goose?</i> The answer to this, as to other questions suggested
below, may be of no direct or special interest to the children themselves. But teachers
should know some of the main conclusions arrived at by folklorists and others in their
investigations of the traditional materials used for basic work in literature. All the
evidence shows that Mother Goose as the name of the familiar old lady of the nursery
came to us from France. Andrew Lang discovered a reference to her in a French
poem of 1650, where she figures as a teller of stories. In 1697 Perrault's famous fairy
tales were published with a frontispiece representing an old woman spinning, and
telling tales to a man, a girl, a little boy, and a cat. On this frontispiece was the
legend, <i>Tales of Our Mother Goose</i>. (See note to No. <a href="#Note_161">161</a>.)</p>

<p>As a teller of prose tales, Mother Goose came to England with the translation
of Perrault about 1730. We do not find her name connected with verse until after
the middle of the eighteenth century. About the year 1760 a little book called
<i>Mother Goose's Melody</i> was issued by John Newbery, a London publisher and a
most important figure in the history of the production of books for children. It is
a pleasant and not improbable theory that this first collection of nursery rhymes,
upon which later ones were built, was the work of Oliver Goldsmith, who was for
some years in Newbery's employ. However that may be, it is certain that from
this date the name of Mother Goose has been almost exclusively associated with
nursery rhymes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Newbery's <i>Mother Goose's Melody</i> was soon reprinted by Isaiah Thomas, of
Worcester, Massachusetts, and thus came into the hands of American children early
in our national life. A long-since exploded theory was advanced about 1870 that
Mother Goose was a real woman of Boston in the early eighteenth century, whose
rhymes were published by her son-in-law, Thomas Fleet, in 1719. But no one has
identified any such publication and there is no evidence whatever that this old lady
in cap and spectacles is other than purely mythical.</p>

<p><i>Whence came the jingles themselves?</i> It is certain that many nursery rhymes are
both widespread geographically in distribution and of great antiquity. Halliwell
and others have found references to some of them in old books which prove that
many of the English rhymes go back several centuries. They are of popular origin;
that is, they took root anonymously among the folk and were passed on by word of
mouth. When a rhyme can be traced to any known authority we generally find
that the folk have extracted what pleased, have forgotten or modified any original
historical or other application the rhymes may have possessed, and in general have
shaped the rhyme to popular taste. "Thus our old nursery rhymes," says Andrew
Lang, "are smooth stones from the book of time, worn round by constant friction
of tongues long silent. We cannot hope to make new nursery rhymes, any more
than we can write new fairy tales."</p>

<p>Here are a few illustrations of what scholars have been able to tell us of the
sources of the rhymes: "Jack and Jill" preserves the Icelandic myth of two children
caught up into the moon, where they can still be seen carrying a bucket on a pole
between them. "Three Blind Mice" is traced to an old book called <i>Deuteromalia</i>
(1609). "Little Jack Horner" is all that is left of an extended chapbook story,
<i>The Pleasant History of Jack Horner, Containing His Witty Tricks</i>, etc. "Poor Old
Robinson Crusoe" is a fragment from a song by the character Jerry Sneak in Foote's
<i>Mayor of Garratt</i> (1763). "Simple Simon" gives all that the nursery has preserved
of a long chapbook verse story. "A Swarm of Bees in May" was found by Halliwell
quoted in Miege's <i>Great French Dictionary</i> (1687). These and numerous like facts
serve only to impress us with the long and honorable history of the nursery rhyme.</p>

<p><i>Can nursery rhymes be helpfully classified?</i> This question seems of more consequence
to the teacher than the previous ones because it deals with the practical
organization of his material. The most superficial observer can see that Nos. <a href="#Note_3">3</a>, <a href="#Note_36">36</a>,
<a href="#Note_46">46</a>, <a href="#Note_59">59</a>, <a href="#Note_62">62</a>, and <a href="#Note_113">113</a>, on the following pages, are riddles; that Nos. <a href="#Note_22">22</a> and <a href="#Note_30">30</a> are
counting-out rhymes; that Nos. <a href="#Note_37">37</a>, <a href="#Note_38">38</a>, <a href="#Note_39">39</a>, <a href="#Note_40">40</a>, and <a href="#Note_41">41</a> are replies that might be
made to one who indulged unduly in suppositions; that No. <a href="#Note_27">27</a> is a face game, No.
<a href="#Note_75">75</a> a hand game, and No. <a href="#Note_108">108</a> a toe game; that Nos. <a href="#Note_42">42</a>, <a href="#Note_81">81</a>, <a href="#Note_82">82</a>, <a href="#Note_107">107</a>, and <a href="#Note_111">111</a> are
riding songs; that Nos. <a href="#Note_7">7</a>, <a href="#Note_10">10</a>, <a href="#Note_23">23</a>, <a href="#Note_67">67</a>, and <a href="#Note_137">137</a> are proverbial sayings; that Nos. <a href="#Note_64">64</a>
and <a href="#Note_89">89</a> are charms; and so one might continue with groupings based on the immediate
use made of the rhyme, not forgetting the great number that lend themselves to the
purposes of the crooned lullaby or soothing song.</p>

<p>Halliwell made the first attempt at any complete classification in his <i>Nursery
Rhymes of England</i> (1842), using eighteen headings: (1) Historical, (2) Literal, (3)
Tales, (4) Proverbs, (5) Scholastic, (6) Songs, (7) Riddles, (8) Charms, (9) Gaffers
and Gammers, (10) Games, (11) Paradoxes, (12) Lullabies, (13) Jingles, (14) Love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and Matrimony, (15) Natural History, (16) Accumulative Stories, (17) Local, (18)
Relics. Andrew Lang follows Halliwell, but reduces the classes to fourteen by combining
(2) and (5), (7) and (11), (8) and (12), and by omitting (17). These classifications
are made from the standpoint of the folklore scholar, and are based on the
sources from which the rhymes originally sprang. Professor Saintsbury scouts the
value of any such arrangement, since all belong equally in the one class, "jingles,"
and he also rightly points out that "all genuine nursery rhymes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have never
become nursery rhymes until the historical fact has been practically forgotten by
those who used them, and nothing but the metrical and musical attraction remains."</p>

<p>Without denying the great significance of popular rhymes to the student of folklore,
we must look elsewhere for any practical suggestion for the teacher in the matter
of arrangement. Such a suggestion will be found in the late Charles Welsh's <i>Book of
Nursery Rhymes</i>, a little volume that every teacher interested in children's literature
must make use of. The rhymes are grouped into three main divisions: (1) Mother
Play, (2) Mother Stories, and (3) Child Play, with subordinate groupings under each.
About 250 rhymes are included in Welsh's collection, and the arrangement suggests
the best order for using them practically, without dropping into any ironclad system.</p>

<p>It may be argued that any attempt at classification of material so freely and
variously used as the Mother Goose rhymes is sure to stiffen the work of the class
and render it less enjoyable. Spontaneity is more vital here than at any other stage
of one's literary education.</p>

<p><i>What is the secret of the nursery rhyme's appeal to children?</i> Here at least we are
face to face with what may be called a final fact, that these jingles do make an appeal
so universal and remarkable that any attempt to explain it seems always to fall far
short of completeness. Perhaps the best start may be made with Mr. Welsh's suggestion
that this appeal is threefold: first, that which comes from the rhyming jingle, as
in "Higgledy, piggledy, my fat hen"; second, that which comes from the nonsense
surprises, as in "Hey diddle diddle," "Three wise men of Gotham," and "I'll
tell you a story"; third, that which comes from the dramatic action, as in "Little
Miss Muffet," and "Little Jack Horner." This summary does not differ much from
Mr. Walter Taylor Field's conclusions: "The child takes little thought as to what
<i>any</i> of these verses mean. There are perhaps four elements in them that appeal to
him,&mdash;first, the jingle, and with it that peculiar cadence which modern writers of
children's poetry strive in vain to imitate; second, the nonsense,&mdash;with just enough
of sense in it to connect the nonsense with the child's thinkable world; third, the
action,&mdash;for the stories are quite dramatic in their way; and fourth, the quaintness."
Mr. Field also emphasizes the probable charm of mystery in the face of the unknown
facts beyond the child's horizon, which appear in many of the rhymes.</p>

<p>Other commentators do little beyond expanding some of these suggestions.
All of them agree in stressing the appeal made by rhythm, the jingle, the emphatic
meter. This seems a fundamental thing in all literature, though readers are mainly
conscious of it in poetry. Just how fundamental it is in human life has not been
better hinted than in a sentence by Mrs. MacClintock: "One who is trying to write
a sober treatise in a matter-of-fact way dares not, lest he be set down as the veriest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
mystic, say all the things that might be said about the function of rhythm, especially
in its more pronounced form of meter, among a community of children, no matter
what the size of the group&mdash;how rhythmic motion, or the flow of measured and
beautiful sounds, harmonizes their differences, tunes them up to their tasks, disciplines
their conduct, comforts their hurts, quiets their nerves; all this apart from
the facts more or less important from the point of view of literature, that it cultivates
their ear, improves their taste, and provides them a genuinely artistic pleasure."</p>

<p>Professor Saintsbury, as usual, adds a fascinating turn to the discussion when,
after agreeing that we may see in the rhymes, "to a great extent, the poetical appeal
of sound as opposed to that of meaning in its simplest and most unmistakable terms,"
he continues: "And we shall find something else, which I venture to call the attraction
of the inarticulate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In moments of more intense and genuine feeling .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
[man] does not as a rule use or at least confine himself to articulate speech.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
All children .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fall naturally, long after they are able to express themselves
as it is called rationally, into a sort of pleasant gibberish when they are alone and
pleased or even displeased.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It must be a not infrequent experience of most
people that one frequently falls into pure jingle and nonsense verse of the nursery
kind.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I should myself, though I may not carry many people with me, go
farther than this and say that this 'attraction of the inarticulate,' this allurement of
mere sound and sequence, has a great deal more to do than is generally thought with
the charm of the very highest poetry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the best nursery rhymes, as in the
simpler and more genuine ballads which have so close a connection with them, we
find this attraction of the inarticulate&mdash;this charm of pure sound, this utilizing of
alliteration and rhyme and assonance." Those who have noticed the tendency of
children to find vocal pleasure even of a physical or muscular sort in nonsense combinations
of sounds, and who also realize their own tendency in this direction, will
feel that Professor Saintsbury has hit upon a suggestive term in his claim for "the
attraction of the inarticulate" as a partial explanation of the Mother Goose appeal.</p>

<p>Through song, game, memorization, and dramatization, traditional or original, the
rhymes may be made to contribute to the child's satisfaction in all of the directions
pointed out.</p>


<h3><br />SUGGESTIONS FOR READING</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(Books referred to by authors' names are listed in preceding bibliography.)</p>

<p>For orientation read Chauncey B. Tinker, "In Praise of Nursery Lore," <i>Unpopular Review</i>,
Vol. VI, p. 338 (Oct.-Dec., 1916). For a most satisfactory presentation of the whole subject read
chap. x, "Mother Goose," in Field. For the origin of Mother Goose as a character consult Lang's
introduction to his edition of <i>Perrault's Popular Tales</i>. For the theory of her American nativity
see Wheeler and Whitmore. For the origins of the rhymes themselves the authorities are Halliwell
and Eckenstein. For pedagogical suggestions see Welsh, also his article "Nursery Rhymes," <i>Cyclopedia
of Education</i> (ed. Monroe). For many interesting facts and suggestions on rhythm in nursery
rhymes consult Charles H. Sears, "Studies in Rhythm," <i>Pedagogical Seminary</i>, Vol. VIII, p. 3.
For the whole subject of folk songs look into Martinengo-Cesaresco, <i>The Study of Folk Songs</i>. Books
and periodicals dealing with primary education often contain brief discussions of value on the use
of rhymes. Many Mother Goose records have been prepared by the educational departments of
the various talking-machine companies, and may be used to advantage in the work in rhythm.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The shorter rhymes (Nos. <a href="#Note_1">1</a>-<a href="#Note_115">115</a>) are arranged
in alphabetical order. There are many
slight variations in the form of the text as
found in printed versions and in the oral
versions used by children in different communities.
While Halliwell has been used
as the basis for rhymes given in his collection,
the following versions try to reproduce
the forms of expression that seem generally
most pleasing to children.</p>

<div class="hang1">Nos. <a href="#Note_119">119</a>-<a href="#Note_146">146</a> are in the main the longer nursery
favorites and may somewhat loosely
be called the novels and epics of the nursery
as the former group may be called the
lyrics and short stories. All of them are
marked by dramatic power, a necessary
element in all true classics for children
whether in verse or prose. Nos. <a href="#Note_119">119</a> and
<a href="#Note_120">120</a> are two of the favorite jingles used in
teaching the alphabet. Each letter suggests
a distinct image. In No. <a href="#Note_119">119</a> the
images are all of actions, and connected by
the direction of these actions upon a single
object. In No. <a href="#Note_120">120</a> the images are each
complete and independent. Here it may be
noticed that some of the elements of the
pictures are determined by the exigencies
of rhyme, as, for instance, what the archer
shot at, and what the lady had. The
originator doubtless expected the child to
see the relation of cause and consequence
between Y and Z.</div>

And all the night they hunted,<br />

One said it was the moon,<br />

The third said it was a cheese,<br />

<h4><br />THERE WAS A LITTLE MAN</h4>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There was a little man,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he had a little gun,</span><br />
And his bullets were made of lead, lead, lead;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He went to a brook,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And fired at a duck,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>And shot it through the head, head, head.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He carried it home</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To his old wife Joan,</span><br />
And bade her a fire to make, make, make,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To roast the little duck,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He had shot in the brook,</span><br />
And he'd go and fetch her the drake, drake, drake.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The drake was a-swimming,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With his curly tail;</span><br />
The little man made it his mark, mark, mark!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He let off his gun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But he fired too soon,</span><br />
And the drake flew away with a quack, quack, quack.<br />

<h4><br />TOM THE PIPER'S SON</h4>

<div class='poem'>
Tom he was a piper's son,<br />
He learned to play when he was young,<br />
But all the tunes that he could play,<br />
Was "Over the hills and far away";<br />
<i>Over the hills, and a great way off,</i><br />
<i>And the wind will blow my top-knot off.</i><br />
<br />
Now Tom with his pipe made such a noise,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>That he pleased both the girls and boys,<br />
And they stopped to hear him play,<br />
"Over the hills and far away."<br />
<br />
Tom with his pipe did play with such skill,<br />
That those who heard him could never keep still;<br />
Whenever they heard him they began to dance,<br />
Even pigs on their hind legs would after him prance.<br />
<br />
As Dolly was milking her cow one day,<br />
Tom took out his pipe and began to play;<br />
So Doll and the cow danced "the Cheshire round,"<br />
Till the pail was broke and the milk ran on the ground.<br />
<br />
He met old dame Trot with a basket of eggs,<br />
He used his pipes and she used her legs;<br />
She danced about till the eggs were all broke,<br />
She began for to fret, but he laughed at the joke.<br />
<br />
He saw a cross fellow was beating an ass,<br />
Heavy laden with pots, pans, dishes, and glass;<br />
He took out his pipe and played them a tune,<br />
And the jackass's load was lightened full soon.<br />

<h4><br />THE BABES IN THE WOOD</h4>

<div class='poem'>
My dear, you must know that a long time ago,<br />
Two poor little children whose names I don't know,<br />
Were stolen away on a fine summer's day,<br />
And left in a wood, as I've heard people say.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Poor babes in the wood, poor babes in the wood!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>So hard was the fate of the babes in the wood.</i></span><br />
<br />
And when it was night, so sad was their plight,<br />
The sun it went down, and the stars gave no light.<br />
They sobbed and they sighed, and they bitterly cried,<br />
And the poor little things they lay down and died.<br />
<br />
And when they were dead, the robins so red,<br />
Brought strawberry leaves, and over them spread.<br />
And all the day long, the branches among,<br />
They sang to them softly, and this was their song:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Poor babes in the wood, poor babes in the wood!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>So hard was the fate of the babes in the wood.</i></span><br /></div>

The fox and his wife they had a great strife,<br />
They never ate mustard in all their whole life;<br />
They ate their meat without fork or knife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And loved to be picking a bone, e-oh!</span><br />
<br />
The fox jumped up on a moonlight night;<br />
The stars they were shining, and all things bright;<br />
Oh, ho! said the fox, it's a very fine night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For me to go through the town, e-oh!</span><br />
<br />
The fox when he came to yonder stile,<br />
He lifted his ears and he listened awhile!<br />
Oh, ho! said the fox, it's but a short mile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From this unto yonder wee town, e-oh!</span><br />
<br />
The fox when he came to the farmer's gate,<br />
Who should he see but the farmer's drake;<br />
I love you well for your master's sake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And long to be picking your bone, e-oh!</span><br />
<br />
The gray goose she ran round the haystack,<br />
Oh, ho! said the fox, you are very fat;<br />
You'll grease my beard and ride on my back<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From this into yonder wee town, e-oh!</span><br />
<br />
The farmer's wife she jumped out of bed,<br />
And out of the window she popped her head:<br />
Oh, husband! oh, husband! the geese are all dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the fox has been through the town, e-oh!</span><br />
<br />
The farmer he loaded his pistol with lead,<br />
And shot the old rogue of a fox through the head;<br />
Ah, ha! said the farmer, I think you're quite dead;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no more you'll trouble the town, e-oh!</span><br />

<h4><br />THE COURTSHIP, MERRY MARRIAGE,<br />
AND PICNIC DINNER<br />
OF COCK ROBIN AND<br />
JENNY WREN;</h4>

<div class='center'>TO WHICH IS ADDED</div>

<h4>THE DOLEFUL DEATH OF COCK ROBIN</h4>

<div class='poem'>
It was a merry time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Jenny Wren was young,</span><br />
So neatly as she danced,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so sweetly as she sung,</span><br />
Robin Redbreast lost his heart:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was a gallant bird;</span><br />
He doft his hat to Jenny,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus to her he said:&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
"My dearest Jenny Wren,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If you will but be mine,</span><br />
You shall dine on cherry pie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drink nice currant wine.</span><br />
I'll dress you like a Goldfinch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or like a Peacock gay;</span><br />
So if you'll have me, Jenny,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let us appoint the day."</span><br />
<br />
Jenny blushed behind her fan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus declared her mind:</span><br />
"Then let it be to-morrow, Bob,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I take your offer kind&mdash;</span><br />
Cherry pie is very good!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So is currant wine!</span><br />
But I will wear my brown gown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never dress too fine."</span><br />
<br />
Robin rose up early<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the break of day;</span><br />
He flew to Jenny Wren's house,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To sing a roundelay.</span><br />
He met the Cock and Hen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bid the Cock declare,</span><br />
This was his wedding-day<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Jenny Wren, the fair.</span><br />
<br />
The Cock then blew his horn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To let the neighbors know,</span><br />
This was Robin's wedding-day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they might see the show.</span><br />
And first came parson Rook,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his spectacles and band,</span><br />
And one of <i>Mother Hubbard's</i> books<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He held within his hand.</span><br />
<br />
Then followed him the Lark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he could sweetly sing,</span><br />
And he was to be clerk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At Cock Robin's wedding.</span><br />
He sang of Robin's love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For little Jenny Wren;</span><br />
And when he came unto the end,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he began again.</span><br />
<br />
Then came the bride and bridegroom;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quite plainly was she dressed,</span><br />
And blushed so much, her cheeks were<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As red as Robin's breast.</span><br />
But Robin cheered her up:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My pretty Jen," said he,</span><br />
"We're going to be married<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And happy we shall be."</span><br />
<br />
The Goldfinch came on next,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To give away the bride;</span><br />
The Linnet, being bride's maid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walked by Jenny's side;</span><br />
And, as she was a-walking,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She said, "Upon my word,</span><br />
I think that your Cock Robin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is a very pretty bird."</span><br />
<br />
The Bullfinch walked by Robin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus to him did say,</span><br />
"Pray, mark, friend Robin Redbreast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Goldfinch, dressed so gay;</span><br />
What though her gay apparel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Becomes her very well,</span><br />
Yet Jenny's modest dress and look<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must bear away the bell."</span><br />
<br />
The Blackbird and the Thrush,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And charming Nightingale,</span><br />
Whose sweet jug sweetly echoes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through every grove and dale;</span><br />
The Sparrow and Tom Tit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many more, were there:</span><br />
All came to see the wedding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Jenny Wren, the fair.</span><br />
<br />
"O then," says parson Rook,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Who gives this maid away?"</span><br />
"I do," says the Goldfinch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And her fortune I will pay:</span><br />
Here's a bag of grain of many sorts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And other things beside;</span><br />
Now happy be the bridegroom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And happy be the bride!"</span><br />
<br />
"And will you have her, Robin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be your wedded wife?"</span><br />
"Yes, I will," says Robin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And love her all my life."</span><br />
"And will you have him, Jenny,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your husband now to be?"</span><br />
"Yes, I will," says Jenny,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And love him heartily."</span><br />
<br />
Then on her finger fair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cock Robin put the ring;</span><br />
"You're married now," says parson Rook,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the Lark aloud did sing:</span><br />
"Happy be the bridegroom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And happy be the bride!</span><br />
And may not man, nor bird, nor beast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This happy pair divide."</span><br />
<br />
The birds were asked to dine;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not Jenny's friends alone,</span><br />
But every pretty songster<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That had Cock Robin known.</span><br />
They had a cherry pie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Besides some currant wine,</span><br />
And every guest brought something,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sumptuous they might dine.</span><br />
<br />
Now they all sat or stood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To eat and to drink;</span><br />
And every one said what<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He happened to think;</span><br />
They each took a bumper,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drank to the pair:</span><br />
Cock Robin, the bridegroom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Jenny Wren, the fair.</span><br />
<br />
The dinner-things removed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They all began to sing;</span><br />
And soon they made the place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Near a mile round to ring.</span><br />
The concert it was fine;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And every bird tried</span><br />
Who best could sing for Robin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Jenny Wren, the bride.</span><br />
<br />
Then in came the Cuckoo,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he made a great rout:</span><br />
He caught hold of Jenny,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pulled her about.</span><br />
Cock Robin was angry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so was the Sparrow,</span><br />
Who fetched in a hurry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His bow and his arrow.</span><br />
<br />
His aim then he took,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he took it not right;</span><br />
His skill was not good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or he shot in a fright;</span><br />
For the Cuckoo he missed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Cock Robin killed!&mdash;</span><br />
And all the birds mourned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That his blood was so spilled.</span><br />

<h4><br />THE BURIAL OF POOR
COCK ROBIN</h4>

<div class='poem'>
Who killed Cock Robin?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I," said the Sparrow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With my bow and arrow;</span><br />
And I killed Cock Robin."<br />
<br />
Who saw him die?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I," said the Fly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With my little eye;</span><br />
And I saw him die."<br />
<br />
Who caught his blood?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I," said the Fish,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With my little dish;</span><br />
And I caught his blood."<br />
<br />
Who made his shroud?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I," said the Beetle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With my little needle;</span><br />
And I made his shroud."<br />
<br />
Who will be the parson?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I," said the Rook;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With my little book;</span><br />
And I will be the parson."<br />
<br />
Who will dig his grave?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I," said the Owl,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With my spade and shovel;</span><br />
And I'll dig his grave."<br />
<br />
Who will be the clerk?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I," said the Lark,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"If 'tis not in the dark;</span><br />
And I will be the clerk."<br />
<br />
Who'll carry him to the grave?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I," said the Kite,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"If 'tis not in the night;</span><br />
And I'll carry him to the grave."<br />
<br />
Who will be the chief mourner?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I," said the Dove,</span><br />

And I will be chief mourner."<br />
<br />
Who will sing a psalm?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I," said the Thrush,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As she sat in a bush;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>"And I will sing a psalm."<br />
<br />
Who will bear the pall?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"We," said the Wren,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Both the Cock and the Hen;</span><br />
"And we will bear the pall."<br />
<br />
Who will toll the bell?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I," said the Bull,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Because I can pull."</span><br />
And so, Cock Robin, farewell.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">All the birds of the air</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Fell to sighing and sobbing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When they heard the bell toll</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For poor Cock Robin.</span><br />

<h3><br /><a name="Note_143" id="Note_143">143</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The following tale was edited (1885) for children
by John Ruskin from a version "written
principally by a lady of ninety (Mrs.
Sharp.)" Ruskin himself added the third,
fourth, eighth, and ninth stanzas, because
"in the old books no account is given of
what the cats learned when they went to
school, and I thought my younger readers
might be glad of some notice of such
particulars." But he thought his rhymes
did not ring like the real ones, of which he
said: "I aver these rhymes to possess the
primary value of rhyme&mdash;that is, to be
rhythmical in a pleasant and exemplary
degree." The book was illustrated with
quaint woodcuts for each stanza after the
edition of 1823, with additional drawings
for the four new stanzas by Kate Greenaway,
one of the most famous illustrators
of children's books. Ruskin commends the
result "to the indulgence of the Christmas
fireside, because it relates nothing that is
sad, and portrays nothing that is ugly."</div>


<h4><br />DAME WIGGINS OF LEE, AND
HER SEVEN WONDERFUL CATS</h4>

<div class='poem'>
Dame Wiggins of Lee<br />
Was a worthy old soul,<br />
As e'er threaded a nee-<br />
dle, or wash'd in a bowl;<br />
She held mice and rats<br />
In such antipa-thy,<br />
That seven fine cats<br />
Kept Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
The rats and mice scared<br />
By this fierce whisker'd crew,<br />
The poor seven cats<br />
Soon had nothing to do;<br />
So, as any one idle<br />
She ne'er loved to see,<br />
She sent them to school,<br />
Did Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
The Master soon wrote<br />
That they all of them knew<br />
How to read the word "milk"<br />
And to spell the word "mew."<br />
And they all washed their faces<br />
Before they took tea:<br />
"Were there ever such dears!"<br />
Said Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
He had also thought well<br />
To comply with their wish<br />
To spend all their play-time<br />
In learning to fish<br />
For stitlings; they sent her<br />
A present of three,<br />
Which, fried, were a feast<br />
For Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
But soon she grew tired<br />
Of living alone;<br />
So she sent for her cats<br />
From school to come home.<br />
Each rowing a wherry,<br />
Returning you see:<br />
The frolic made merry<br />
Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
The Dame was quite pleas'd<br />
And ran out to market;<br />
When she came back<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>They were mending the carpet.<br />
The needle each handled<br />
As brisk as a bee;<br />
"Well done, my good cats,"<br />
Said Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
To give them a treat,<br />
She ran out for some rice;<br />
When she came back,<br />
They were skating on ice.<br />
"I shall soon see one down,<br />
Aye, perhaps, two or three,<br />
I'll bet half-a-crown,"<br />
Said Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
When spring-time came back<br />
They had breakfast of curds;<br />
And were greatly afraid<br />
Of disturbing the birds.<br />
"If you sit, like good cats,<br />
All the seven in a tree,<br />
They will teach you to sing!"<br />
Said Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
So they sat in a tree,<br />
And said "Beautiful! Hark!"<br />
And they listened and looked<br />
In the clouds for the lark.<br />
Then sang, by the fireside,<br />
Symphonious-ly<br />
A song without words<br />
To Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
They called the next day<br />
On the tomtit and sparrow,<br />
And wheeled a poor sick lamb<br />
Home in a barrow.<br />
"You shall all have some sprats<br />
For your humani-ty,<br />
My seven good cats,"<br />
Said Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
While she ran to the field,<br />
To look for its dam,<br />
They were warming the bed<br />
For the poor sick lamb:<br />
They turn'd up the clothes<br />
All as neat as could be;<br />
"I shall ne'er want a nurse,"<br />
Said Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
She wished them good night,<br />
And went up to bed:<br />
When, lo! in the morning,<br />
The cats were all fled.<br />
But soon&mdash;what a fuss!<br />
"Where can they all be?<br />
Here, pussy, puss, puss!"<br />
Cried Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
The Dame's heart was nigh broke,<br />
So she sat down to weep,<br />
When she saw them come back<br />
Each riding a sheep:<br />
She fondled and patted<br />
Each purring tom-my:<br />
"Ah! welcome, my dears,"<br />
Said Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
The Dame was unable<br />
Her pleasure to smother,<br />
To see the sick lamb<br />
Jump up to its mother.<br />
In spite of the gout,<br />
And a pain in her knee,<br />
She went dancing about:<br />
Did Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
The Farmer soon heard<br />
Where his sheep went astray,<br />
And arrived at Dame's door<br />
With his faithful dog Tray.<br />
He knocked with his crook,<br />
And the stranger to see,<br />
Out the window did look<br />
Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
For their kindness he had them<br />
All drawn by his team;<br />
And gave them some field-mice,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>And raspberry-cream.<br />
Said he, "All my stock<br />
You shall presently see;<br />
For I honor the cats<br />
Of Dame Wiggins of Lee."<br />
<br />
He sent his maid out<br />
For some muffins and crumpets;<br />
And when he turn'd round<br />
They were blowing of trumpets.<br />
Said he, "I suppose<br />
She's as deaf as can be,<br />
Or this ne'er could be borne<br />
By Dame Wiggins of Lee."<br />
<br />
To show them his poultry,<br />
He turn'd them all loose,<br />
When each nimbly leap'd<br />
On the back of a goose,<br />
Which frighten'd them so<br />
That they ran to the sea,<br />
And half-drown'd the poor cats<br />
Of Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
<br />
For the care of his lamb,<br />
And their comical pranks,<br />
He gave them a ham<br />
And abundance of thanks.<br />
"I wish you good-day,<br />
My fine fellows," said he;<br />
"My compliments, pray,<br />
To Dame Wiggins of Lee."<br />
<br />
You see them arrived<br />
At their Dame's welcome door;<br />
They show her their presents,<br />
And all their good store.<br />
"Now come in to supper,<br />
And sit down with me;<br />
All welcome once more,"<br />
Cried Dame Wiggins of Lee.<br />
</div>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_144" id="Note_144">144</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">This is the perfect pattern of all the accumulative
stories, perhaps the best known and
most loved of children among all nursery
jingles. Halliwell thought it descended
from the mystical Hebrew hymn, "A kid, a
kid," found in the Talmud. Most commentators
since have followed his example
in calling attention to the parallel, though
scholars have insisted that the hymn referred
to is a late interpolation. The hymn opens:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"A kid, a kid, my father bought,<br />
For two pieces of money:<br />
A kid, a kid.<br />
<br />
"Then came the cat, and ate the kid,<br />
That my father bought," etc.<br />
</div>

<div class='hang1'>Then came the dog and bit the cat, then the
staff and beat the dog, then the fire and
burned the staff, then water and quenched
the fire, then the ox and drank the water,
then the butcher and slew the ox, then the
angel of death and killed the butcher, and
the hymn concludes:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Then came the Holy One, blessed be He!<br />
And killed the angel of death,<br />
That killed the butcher,<br />
That slew the ox,<br />
That drank the water,<br />
That quenched the fire,<br />
That burned the staff,<br />
That beat the dog,<br />
That bit the cat,<br />
That ate the kid,<br />
That my father bought<br />
For two pieces of money:<br />
A kid, a kid."<br />
</div>

<div class='hang1'>There is an elaborate interpretation of the
symbolism of this hymn, going back at least
as far as 1731, in which the kid denotes the
Hebrews, the father is Jehovah, the cat is
the Assyrians, the dog is the Babylonians,
the staff is the Persians, the fire is Greece
under Alexander, the water is the Roman
Empire, the ox is the Saracens, the butcher
is the crusaders, the angel of death is the
Turkish power, while the concluding accumulation
shows that God will take vengeance
on the enemies of the chosen people.
This is the interpretation in barest outline
only. Without the key no one would ever
guess its hidden meaning. Fortunately,
"The House That Jack Built" has no such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
hidden meaning. But the important point
is that such accumulative stories are almost
as old as human records, and, like so many
other possessions of the race, seem to have
come to us from the Far East.</div>


<h4><br />THIS IS THE HOUSE

<div class='poem'>
This is the house that Jack built.<br />

<h4><br />CHANGE ABOUT</h4>

<div class='poem'>
There was an old man, who lived in a wood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you may plainly see;</span><br />
He said he could do as much work in a day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As his wife could do in three.</span><br />
With all my heart, the old woman said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If that you will allow,</span><br />
To-morrow you'll stay at home in my stead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I'll go drive the plough:</span><br />
<br />
But you must milk the Tidy cow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For fear that she go dry;</span><br />
And you must feed the little pigs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That are within the sty;</span><br />
And you must mind the speckled hen,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">For fear she lay away;</span><br />
And you must reel the spool of yarn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I spun yesterday.</span><br />
<br />
The old woman took a staff in her hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And went to drive the plough:</span><br />
The old man took a pail in his hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And went to milk the cow;</span><br />
But Tidy hinched, and Tidy flinched,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Tidy broke his nose,</span><br />
And Tidy gave him such a blow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the blood ran down to his toes.</span><br />
<br />
High! Tidy! ho! Tidy! high!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tidy! do stand still;</span><br />
If ever I milk you, Tidy, again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twill be sore against my will!</span><br />
<br />
He went to feed the little pigs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That were within the sty;</span><br />
He hit his head against the beam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he made the blood to fly.</span><br />
He went to mind the speckled hen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For fear she'd lay astray,</span><br />
And he forgot the spool of yarn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His wife spun yesterday.</span><br />
<br />
So he swore by the sun, the moon, and the stars,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the green leaves on the tree,</span><br />
"If my wife doesn't do a day's work in her life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She shall ne'er be ruled by me."</span><br />

<h2>SECTION III: FAIRY STORIES&mdash;TRADITIONAL TALES</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p>The forty-three tales in this section have been chosen (1) in the light of what
experience shows children most enjoy, (2) to represent as fully as possible the great
variety of our traditional inheritance, (3) to afford an opportunity of calling attention
to additional riches in various collections, and (4) to suggest a fair minimum of the
amount of such material to be used with children. As in all such questions of judgment,
there must inevitably be differences of opinion. Many will doubtless find
stories missing that seem necessary even to so small a list, while others will find tales
included that may seem questionable. Such a selection can be, and is intended to
be, only tentative, a starting point from which there are many lines of departure.</p>

<p><i>Folklore.</i> These tales are all from the traditional field. They are mainly of
anonymous and popular origin, handed down orally by peasants. The investigation
of their origin, distribution, and interrelations belongs to the science of folklore. A
good-sized library could be filled entirely with the books concerned with the studies
and disputations in this interesting field. While the folklorists have very much of
value to tell the teacher, their questions may be largely ignored until the latter is
quite fully acquainted with a large body of the acknowledged masterpieces among
folk stories, especially those which the schools have taken to themselves as useful
in elementary work. Teachers interested in pursuing the matter further&mdash;and it
is to be hoped there are many such&mdash;will find suggestions in the notes at the head of
each tale and in the preceding bibliography that may prove serviceable in directing
them some little way. Each book will point the student to many others; when he is
once started on the road of investigation, there will open up many unexpected and
fascinating vistas.</p>

<p><i>Objections to fairy tales.</i> These objections seem to fall as a rule under two main
heads. First, there are those who object to any stimulation of the fanciful in children,
and who would have us confine ourselves to what they call realities. They would
eliminate as far as possible all the imaginings of children. The make-believe world
so dear to infancy has no place in their creed. Second, there are those who doubt
the moral tendency of all fairy tales. They observe that many of these tales come
to us from a cruder and coarser social state than our own, that they contain elements
of a superstitious and animistic past, that they often deal with cruelties and horrors,
trickeries and disloyalties, that they are full of romantic improbabilities and impossibilities.
It may as well be admitted at once that the folklore of the world contains
many stories to which these and other objections are valid.</p>

<p><i>Is there a proper line of defense for fairy tales?</i> Dr. Felix Adler, who certainly
cannot be accused of being insensible to realities, puts the case thus, as between
defenders and objectors: "I venture to think that, as in many other cases, the cause
of the quarrel is what logicians call an <i>undistributed middle</i>&mdash;in other words, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the parties to the dispute have each a different kind of fairy tale in mind. This
species of literature can be divided broadly into two classes&mdash;one consisting of tales
which ought to be rejected because they are really harmful, and children ought to be
protected from their bad influence, the other of tales which have a most beautiful
and elevating effect, and which we cannot possibly afford to leave unutilized." Dr.
Adler proceeds to point out that the chief pedagogic values of the latter class are
(1) that they exercise and cultivate the imagination, and (2) that they stimulate the
idealizing tendency.</p>

<p>John Ruskin, another teacher who constantly in his writings throws the emphasis
upon the necessity of a true ethical understanding, has this to say about the mischievous
habit of trying to remake the fairy story in the service of morals: "And the
effect of the endeavor to make stories moral upon the literary merit of the work
itself, is as harmful as the motive of the effort is false. For every fairy tale worth
recording at all is the remnant of a tradition possessing true historical value;&mdash;historical,
at least in so far as it has naturally arisen out of the mind of a people under
special circumstances, and arisen not without meaning, nor removed altogether from
their sphere of religious faith. It sustains afterwards natural changes from the
sincere action of the fear or fancy of successive generations; it takes new color from
their manner of life, and new form from their changing moral tempers. As long as
these changes are natural and effortless, accidental and inevitable, the story remains
essentially true, altering its form, indeed, like a flying cloud, but remaining a sign
of the sky; a shadowy image, as truly a part of the great firmament of the human
mind as the light of reason which it seems to interrupt. But the fair deceit and
innocent error of it cannot be interpreted nor restrained by a wilful purpose, and all
additions to it by art do but defile, as the shepherd disturbs the flakes of morning
mist with smoke from his fire of dead leaves." Instead of retouching stories "to
suit particular tastes, or inculcate favorite doctrines," Ruskin would have the child
"know his fairy tale accurately, and have perfect joy or awe in the conception of it
as if it were real; thus he will always be exercising his power of grasping realities:
but a confused, careless, and discrediting tenure of the fiction will lead to as confused
and careless reading of fact." Still further, Ruskin defends the vulgarity, or commonness
of language, found in many of the tales as "of a wholesome and harmless
kind. It is not, for instance, graceful English, to say that a thought 'popped into
Catherine's head'; but it nevertheless is far better, as an initiation into literary
style, that a child should be told this than that 'a subject attracted Catherine's
attention.'"</p>

<p>Finally, we cannot forbear adding one more quotation, from the most delightful
of attacks upon the attackers of fairy tales, by Miss Repplier: "That which is vital
in literature or tradition, which has survived the obscurity and wreckage of the past,
whether as legend, or ballad, or mere nursery rhyme, has survived in right of some
intrinsic merit of its own, and will not be snuffed out of existence by any of our precautionary
or hygienic measures.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Puss in Boots is one long record of triumphant
effrontery and deception. An honest and self-respecting lad would have explained to
the king that he was not the Marquis of Carabas at all; that he had no desire to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
profit by his cat's ingenious falsehoods, and no weak ambition to connect himself
with the aristocracy. Such a hero would be a credit to our modern schoolrooms,
and lift a load of care from the shoulders of our modern critics. Only the children
would have none of him, but would turn wistfully back to those brave old tales which
are their inheritance from a splendid past, and of which no hand shall rob them."
And upon this ultimate fact that in literature the final decision rests with the audience
appealed to, the discussion may end.</p>

<p><i>How to use fairy stories.</i> Briefly, the whole matter may be summed up thus:
<i>Know your story perfectly. Don't read it (unless you can't do better). Tell it&mdash;with all
the graces of voice and action you can command. Tell it naturally and simply, as the
folk-tellers did, not with studied and elaborate "elocutionary" effects. Tell it again and
again. If you do it well, the children will not soon tire of it&mdash;and they will indicate
what you should do next!</i></p>


<h3><br />SUGGESTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(Books referred to by authors' name are listed in bibliography.)</p>

<p>The one important full-length discussion for teachers on the whole subject of the fairy tale
is Kready's <i>A Study of Fairy Tales</i>. It is enthusiastic rather than severely critical, and that adds
to its helpfulness. It has exhaustive bibliographies. The Ruskin quotations above are from his
introduction to Taylor's <i>Grimm;</i> it may be found also in his collected works, in <i>On the Old Road</i>.
Miss Repplier's "Battle of the Babies" in her <i>Essays in Miniature</i> should be read entire. A thoroughly
stimulating article is Brian Hooker's "Narrative and the Fairy Tale," <i>Bookman</i>, Vol. XXXIII,
pp. 389, 501; see also his "Types of Fairy Tales," <i>Forum</i>, Vol. XL, p. 375. For the scientific phase
start with Hartland's <i>Science of Fairy Tales</i>. For pedagogy see Adler, MacClintock, McMurry.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_147" id="Note_147">147</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Many English folk tales have doubtless been
lost because no one made a serious attempt
to collect them until railroads, newspapers,
and popular education had greatly changed
the life of the English folk and destroyed
many of the traditions. For the preservation
of many folk tales that we have,
English-speaking peoples are indebted to
the scholarly antiquarian James Orchard
Halliwell (afterwards Halliwell-Phillips,
1820-1889), who in the year 1842 edited a
collection of <i>The Nursery Rhymes of England</i>
for the Percy Society. He followed it a few
years later with <i>Popular Rhymes and Nursery
Tales</i>. They have long been regarded
as the basic books in their field. These
two collections were reprinted as <i>Nursery
Rhymes and Tales</i>. This one-volume edition
is the one referred to in the following
pages. Halliwell should be remembered as
the first person to collect in a scientific way
the folk literature of England. He gathered
these rhymes and tales from the mouths
of the folk, from chapbooks, and from many
other sources and endeavored to tell them
as they had been told by the folk.<br />
<br />
"The Old Woman and Her Pig" is perhaps
the most familiar of all nursery stories. It
belongs to the type of story known as the
"accumulative," of which "The House That
Jack Built" is the purest model. In such
a story there is a constant repetition of the
plot, with an addition or slight change at
each repetition, until at the end there is a
quick unwinding which carries us back to
the initial situation and solves the difficulty
with which the story started. Halliwell
gives two versions of this particular story.
It is so widespread that many slight variations
would be expected in successful
retellings of it. The traditional version
which follows seems to be the favorite with
primary teachers. It introduces at the
sixth stage the attractive rhyme "I see
by the moonlight, etc.," which originally
formed part of another nursery tale.</div>


<h4><br />THE OLD WOMAN AND
HER PIG</h4>

<p>Once upon a time, an old woman was
sweeping her little house, when, to her
great joy, she found a silver sixpence.</p>

<p>"What," said she, "shall I do with
this little sixpence? I think I will go
to market and buy a pig." So the next
day, she went to market, and bought a
nice little white pig. She tied a string
to one of the pig's legs, and began to
drive him home.</p>

<p>On the way, the old woman and her
pig came to a stile, and she said,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Please, pig, get over the stile."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the pig would not.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Just then a little dog came trotting up,
and the old woman said to him,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Dog, dog, bite pig;<br />
Pig won't get over the stile,<br />
And I sha'n't get home to-night."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the dog would not.</span><br />
</div>

<p>So the old woman held up her stick,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Stick, stick, beat dog;<br />
Dog won't bite pig;<br />
Pig won't get over the stile,<br />
And I sha'n't get home to-night."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the stick would not.</span><br />
</div>

<p>So the old woman gathered some bits
of wood together to make a fire, and set
them on fire, and then threw her stick
into the fire, and said,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Fire, fire, burn stick;<br />
Stick won't beat dog;<br />
Dog won't bite pig;<br />
Pig won't get over the stile,<br />
And I sha'n't get home to-night."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the fire would not.</span><br />
</div>

<p>So the old woman fetched a pail of
water that was standing near, and said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Water, water, quench fire;<br />
Fire won't burn stick;<br />
Stick won't beat dog;<br />
Dog won't bite pig;<br />
Pig won't get over the stile,<br />
And I sha'n't get home to-night."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the water would not.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then the old woman saw an ox coming;
so she said,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Ox, ox, drink water;<br />
Water won't quench fire;<br />
Fire won't burn stick;<br />
Stick won't beat dog;<br />
Dog won't bite pig;<br />
Pig won't go.<br />
I see by the moonlight,<br />
It's long past midnight;<br />
Time pig and I were home an hour and a half ago."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the ox would not.</span><br />
</div>

<p>So the old woman turned round, and
saw a butcher, and she said,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Butcher, butcher, kill ox;<br />
Ox won't drink water;<br />
Water won't quench fire;<br />
Fire won't burn stick;<br />
Stick won't beat dog;<br />
Dog won't bite pig;<br />
Pig won't go.<br />
I see by the moonlight,<br />
It's long past midnight;<br />
Time pig and I were home an hour and a half ago."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the butcher would not.</span><br />
</div>

<p>So the old woman took a rope out of
her pocket, and said,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Rope, rope, hang butcher;<br />
Butcher won't kill ox;<br />
Ox won't drink water;<br />
Water won't quench fire;<br />
Fire won't burn stick;<br />
Stick won't beat dog;<br />
Dog won't bite pig;<br />
Pig won't go.<br />
I see by the moonlight,<br />
It's long past midnight;<br />
Time pig and I were home an hour and a half ago."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the rope would not.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Just then a large brown mouse ran
across the meadow, and she said,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Mouse, mouse, gnaw rope;<br />
Rope won't hang butcher;<br />
Butcher won't kill ox;<br />
Ox won't drink water;<br />
Water won't quench fire;<br />
Fire won't burn stick;<br />
Stick won't beat dog;<br />
Dog won't bite pig;<br />
Pig won't go.<br />
I see by the moonlight,<br />
It's long past midnight;<br />
Time pig and I were home an hour and a half ago."<br />
"Yes," said the mouse, "I will if you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">will give me some cheese."</span><br />
</div>

<p>So the old woman put her hand in her
pocket, and found a nice piece of cheese;
and when the mouse had eaten it,</p>

<div class='poem'>
The mouse began to gnaw the rope,<br />
The rope began to hang the butcher,<br />
The butcher began to kill the ox,<br />
The ox began to drink the water,<br />
The water began to quench the fire,<br />
The fire began to burn the stick,<br />
The stick began to beat the dog,<br />
The dog began to bite the pig,<br />
And the pig began to go.<br />
</div>

<p>But what time the old woman and her
pig got home, you, nor I, nor nobody
knows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_148" id="Note_148">148</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Teachers and parents owe a greater debt of
gratitude to Joseph Jacobs than to any
other modern student of folklore. He was
born in Australia in 1854, spent most of
his life in scholarly pursuits in England, and
died in America in 1916. In his six volumes
of English, Celtic, Indian, and European
fairy tales he gave the world versions of its
best known and most representative folk
stories in a form suited to children while
remaining true in all essentials to the original
oral versions of the folk. This combination
of scientific accuracy and literary
workmanship is very rare. In the introductions
and notes to these various volumes
may be found a wealth of information
which the general reader can understand
without the necessity of special training
in the science of folklore. And best of all,
these volumes can be had at prices that are
comparatively cheap.<br />
<br />
The following story of "Henny-Penny" is
given in the fine version by Joseph Jacobs
in his <i>English Fairy Tales</i>. He heard it as
a child in Australia and he thinks "the fun
consists in the avoidance of all pronouns,
which results in jawbreaking sentences."
This story is also very familiar in the Halliwell
version called "Chicken-Licken," and
there are numerous European parallels.</div>


<h4><br />HENNY-PENNY</h4>

<p>One day Henny-penny was picking up
corn in the cornyard when&mdash;whack!&mdash;something
hit her upon the head. "Goodness gracious me!" said Henny-penny;
"the sky's a-going to fall; I
must go and tell the king."</p>

<p>So she went along, and she went along,
and she went along till she met Cocky-locky.
"Where are you going, Henny-penny?"
says Cocky-locky. "Oh! I'm
going to tell the king the sky's a-falling,"
says Henny-penny. "May I come with
you?" says Cocky-locky. "Certainly,"
says Henny-penny. So Henny-penny
and Cocky-locky went to tell the king
the sky was a-falling.</p>

<p>They went along, and they went along,
and they went along, till they met Ducky-daddles.
"Where are you going to,
Henny-penny and Cocky-locky?" says
Ducky-daddles. "Oh! we're going to
tell the king the sky's a-falling," said
Henny-penny and Cocky-locky. "May
I come with you?" says Ducky-daddles.
"Certainly," said Henny-penny and
Cocky-locky. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,
and Ducky-daddles went to tell
the king the sky was a-falling.</p>

<p>So they went along, and they went
along, and they went along, till they met
Goosey-poosey. "Where are you going
to, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, and
Ducky-daddles?" said Goosey-poosey.
"Oh! we're going to tell the king the
sky's a-falling," said Henny-penny and
Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles. "May
I come with you?" said Goosey-poosey.
"Certainly," said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,
and Ducky-daddles. So Henny-penny,
Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and
Goosey-poosey went to tell the king the
sky was a-falling.</p>

<p>So they went along, and they went
along, and they went along, till they
met Turkey-lurkey. "Where are you
going, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,
and Goosey-poosey?" says
Turkey-lurkey. "Oh! we're going to tell
the king the sky's a-falling," said Henny-penny,
Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and
Goosey-poosey. "May I come with
you, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,
and Goosey-poosey?" said
Turkey-lurkey. "Oh, certainly, Turkey-lurkey,"
said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,
Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey. So
Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>daddles,
Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey
all went to tell the king the sky
was a-falling.</p>

<p>So they went along, and they went
along, and they went along, till they
met Foxy-woxy, and Foxy-woxy said
to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,
Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey:
"Where are you going, Henny-penny,
Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,
Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey?"
And Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,
Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey
said to Foxy-woxy: "We're going
to tell the king the sky's a-falling." "Oh!
but this is not the way to the king, Henny-penny,
Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,
Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey," says
Foxy-woxy; "I know the proper way;
shall I show it you?" "Oh, certainly,
Foxy-woxy," said Henny-Penny, Cocky-locky,
Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey,
and Turkey-lurkey. So Henny-penny,
Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey,
Turkey-lurkey, and Foxy-woxy
all went to tell the king the sky was
a-falling.</p>

<p>So they went along, and they went
along, and they went along, till they
came to a narrow and dark hole. Now
this was the door of Foxy-woxy's cave.
But Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny,
Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey,
and Turkey-lurkey: "This is
the short way to the king's palace;
you'll soon get there if you follow me.
I will go first and you come after,
Henny-Penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,
Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey."
"Why of course, certainly,
without doubt, why not?" said Henny-penny,
Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,
Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.</p>

<p>So Foxy-woxy went into his cave,
and he didn't go very far, but turned
round to wait for Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,
Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey,
and Turkey-lurkey. So at last at first
Turkey-lurkey went through the dark
hole into the cave. He hadn't got far
when "Hrumph," Foxy-woxy snapped off
Turkey-lurkey's head and threw his
body over his left shoulder. Then
Goosey-poosey went in, and "Hrumph,"
off went her head and Goosey-poosey was
thrown beside Turkey-lurkey. Then
Ducky-daddles waddled down, and
"Hrumph," snapped Foxy-woxy, and
Ducky-daddles' head was off and Ducky-daddles
was thrown alongside Turkey-lurkey
and Goosey-poosey. Then Cocky-locky
strutted down into the cave, and
he hadn't gone far when "Snap,
Hrumph!" went Foxy-woxy and Cocky-locky
was thrown alongside of Turkey-lurkey,
Goosey-poosey, and Ducky-daddles.</p>

<p>But Foxy-woxy had made two bites
at Cocky-locky, and when the first snap
only hurt Cocky-locky, but didn't kill
him, he called out to Henny-penny. But
she turned tail and off she ran home, so
she never told the king the sky was
a-falling.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_149" id="Note_149">149</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The favorite story of "Teeny-Tiny" is taken
from Halliwell, who obtained it from oral
tradition, and by whom it was, apparently,
first put into print. "This simple tale,"
he says, "seldom fails to rivet the attention
of children, especially if well told. The last
two words should be said loudly with a
start." Many modern story-tellers seem to
prefer modified forms of this story, presumably
owing to a feeling on their part that
the bone and the churchyard have gruesome
suggestions. Carolyn S. Bailey gives
one of the best of these modified forms in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
<i>Firelight Stories</i>, where the woman goes
into a field instead of the churchyard, finds
a hen at the foot of a tree, thinks this is a
chance to have an egg for her breakfast,
puts the hen in her reticule, goes home, puts
the hen in her cupboard, and goes upstairs
to take a nap. Of course the "teeny-tiny"
goes in at every point. Substituting
"hen" for "bone," the story continues
substantially as given below.</div>

<h4><br />TEENY-TINY</h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was a teeny-tiny
woman lived in a teeny-tiny house
in a teeny-tiny village. Now, one day
this teeny-tiny woman put on her teeny-tiny
bonnet, and went out of her teeny-tiny
house to take a teeny-tiny walk.
And when this teeny-tiny woman had
gone a teeny-tiny way, she came to a
teeny-tiny gate; so the teeny-tiny woman
opened the teeny-tiny gate, and went
into a teeny-tiny churchyard. And when
this teeny-tiny woman had got into the
teeny-tiny churchyard, she saw a teeny-tiny
bone on a teeny-tiny grave, and the
teeny-tiny woman said to her teeny-tiny
self, "This teeny-tiny bone will
make me some teeny-tiny soup for my
teeny-tiny supper." So the teeny-tiny
woman put the teeny-tiny bone into her
teeny-tiny pocket, and went home to
her teeny-tiny house.</p>

<p>Now when the teeny-tiny woman got
home to her teeny-tiny house, she was
a teeny-tiny tired; so she went up her
teeny-tiny stairs to her teeny-tiny bed,
and put the teeny-tiny bone into a teeny-tiny
cupboard. And when this teeny-tiny
woman had been to sleep a teeny-tiny
time, she was awakened by a teeny-tiny
voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard,
which said:</p>

<div class='story1'>
"GIVE ME MY BONE!"<br />
</div>

<p>And this teeny-tiny woman was a
teeny-tiny frightened, so she hid her
teeny-tiny head under the teeny-tiny
clothes and went to sleep again. And
when she had been to sleep again a
teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny voice
again cried out from the teeny-tiny
cupboard a teeny-tiny louder,</p>

<div class='story2'>
"GIVE ME MY BONE!"<br />
</div>

<p>This made the teeny-tiny woman a
teeny-tiny more frightened, so she hid
her teeny-tiny head a teeny-tiny farther
under the teeny-tiny clothes. And when
the teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep
again a teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny
voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard said
again a teeny-tiny louder,</p>

<div class='story3'>
"GIVE ME MY BONE!"<br />
</div>

<p>And this teeny-tiny woman was a
teeny-tiny bit more frightened, but she
put her teeny-tiny head out of the teeny-tiny

teeny-tiny voice,</p>

"TAKE IT!"<br />

<div class="hang1">The very old story that follows is taken from
Halliwell, and is, according to Jacobs,
scarcely more than a variant of "The Old

"The Cat and the Mouse" appeals to small
people by its pronounced rhythmical structure,
accentuated by the rhyme which
marks the transition to each new section,
and by the "run" at the close.</div>

<p>The cat bit the mouse's tail off.

milk, and cat gave mouse her own tail
again.</p>

pigs are distinctly characterized and given
the names of Browny, Whitey, and Blacky.
Jacobs uses the Halliwell version in his

opening formula which seems to have been
much in use by old story-tellers as a way of
beginning almost any oral story for children:</div>

<h4><br />THE STORY OF THE THREE
LITTLE PIGS</h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was an old
sow with three little pigs, and as she
had not enough to keep them, she sent
them out to seek their fortune. The
first that went off met a man with a
bundle of straw, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Please, man, give me that straw to
build me a house."</p>

<p>Which the man did, and the little pig
built a house with it. Presently came
along a wolf, and knocked at the door,
and said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."</p>

<p>To which the pig answered:</p>

<p>"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin
chin."</p>

<p>The wolf then answered to that:</p>

<p>"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll
blow your house in."</p>

<p>So he huffed, and he puffed, and he
blew his house in, and ate up the little
pig.</p>

<p>The second little pig met a man with a
bundle of furze and said:</p>

<p>"Please, man, give me that furze to
build a house."</p>

<p>Which the man did, and the pig built
his house. Then along came the wolf,
and said:</p>

<p>"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."</p>

<p>"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin
chin."</p>

<p>"Then I'll puff, and I'll huff, and I'll
blow your house in."</p>

<p>So he huffed, and he puffed, and he
puffed, and he huffed, and at last he blew
the house down, and he ate up the little
pig.</p>

<p>The third little pig met a man with a
load of bricks, and said:</p>

<p>"Please, man, give me those bricks
to build a house with."</p>

<p>So the man gave him the bricks, and
he built his house with them. So the
wolf came, as he did to the other little
pigs, and said:</p>

<p>"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."</p>

<p>"No, no, by the hair on my chinny chin
chin."</p>

<p>"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll
blow your house in."</p>

<p>Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he
huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and
huffed; but he could <i>not</i> get the house
down. When he found that he could
not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow
the house down, he said:</p>

<p>"Little pig, I know where there is a
nice field of turnips."</p>

<p>"Where?" said the little pig.</p>

<p>"Oh, in Mr. Smith's Home-field, and
if you will be ready to-morrow morning I
will call for you, and we will go together
and get some for dinner."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the little pig, "I will
be ready. What time do you mean to
go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, at six o'clock."</p>

<p>Well, the little pig got up at five and
got the turnips before the wolf came
(which he did about six), who said:</p>

<p>"Little pig, are you ready?"</p>

<p>The little pig said: "Ready! I have
been and come back again, and got a
nice potful for dinner."</p>

<p>The wolf felt very angry at this, but
thought that he would be <i>up to</i> the little
pig somehow or other, so he said:</p>

<p>"Little pig, I know where there is a
nice apple-tree."</p>

<p>"Where?" said the pig.</p>

<p>"Down at Merry-garden," replied the
wolf, "and if you will not deceive me I
will come for you at five o'clock tomorrow
and we will go together and get
some apples."</p>

<p>Well, the little pig bustled up the next
morning at four o'clock, and went off for
the apples, hoping to get back before the
wolf came; but he had farther to go and
had to climb the tree, so that just as he
was coming down from it, he saw the
wolf coming, which, as you may suppose,
frightened him very much. When the
wolf came up he said:</p>

<p>"Little pig, what! are you here before
me? Are they nice apples?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very," said the little pig. "I
will throw you down one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>And he threw it so far that, while the
wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig
jumped down and ran home. The next
day the wolf came again and said to the
little pig:</p>

<p>"Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin
this afternoon. Will you go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the pig, "I will go.
What time shall you be ready?"</p>

<p>"At three," said the wolf. So the
little pig went off before the time as usual,
and got to the fair and bought a butter-churn,
which he was going home with,
when he saw the wolf coming. Then he
could not tell what to do. So he got into
the churn to hide, and by so doing
turned it round, and it rolled down the
hill with the pig in it, which frightened the
wolf so much that he ran home without
going to the fair. He went to the little
pig's house and told him how frightened
he had been by a great round thing which
came down the hill past him. Then the
little pig said:</p>

<p>"Hah, I frightened you, then. I had
been to the fair and bought a butter-churn,
and when I saw you, I got into it
and rolled down the hill."</p>

<p>Then the wolf was very angry indeed,
and declared he <i>would</i> eat up the little
pig and that he would get down the chimney
after him. When the little pig saw
what he was about, he hung on the pot
full of water and made up a blazing fire,
and, just as the wolf was coming down,
took off the cover, and in fell the wolf; so
the little pig put on the cover again in
an instant, boiled him up, and ate him
for supper, and lived happy ever afterwards.</p>

proverbial saying of Poor Richard (see
No. <a href="#Note_137">137</a>). The favorite English folk-tale
version of this theme, taken from Halliwell,
is given below. It takes the form of an
accumulative droll, or comic story. The
overwhelming catastrophe at the end is so
complete and so unexpected that it has a
decidedly humorous effect.</div>


<h4><br />TITTY MOUSE AND TATTY MOUSE</h4>

<div class='poem2'>
Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse both lived in a house,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Titty Mouse went a leasing and Tatty Mouse went a leasing,</span><br />
So they both went a leasing.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Titty Mouse leased an ear of corn, and</span><br />

So they both made a pudding.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Tatty Mouse put her pudding into the pot to boil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when Titty went to put hers in, the pot tumbled over, and scalded her to death.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then Tatty sat down and wept; then
a three-legged stool said: "Tatty, why
do you weep?" "Titty's dead," said
Tatty, "and so I weep." "Then," said
the stool, "I'll hop," so the stool hopped.</p>

<p>Then a broom in the corner of the room
said: "Stool, why do you hop?" "Oh!"
said the stool, "Titty's dead, and Tatty
weeps, and so I hop." "Then," said the
broom, "I'll sweep," so the broom began
to sweep.</p>

<p>"Then," said the door, "Broom, why
do you sweep?" "Oh!" said the broom,
"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the
stool hops, and so I sweep." "Then,"
said the door, "I'll jar," so the door
jarred.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then," said the window, "Door, why
do you jar?" "Oh," said the door,
"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the
stool hops, and the broom sweeps, and
so I jar."</p>

<p>"Then," said the window, "I'll creak,"
so the window creaked. Now there was
an old form outside the house, and when
the window creaked, the form said:
"Window, why do you creak?" "Oh!"
said the window, "Titty's dead, and
Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the
broom sweeps, the door jars, and so I
creak."</p>

<p>"Then," said the old form, "I'll run
round the house"; then the old form ran
round the house. Now there was a fine
large walnut-tree growing by the cottage,
and the tree said to the form: "Form,
why do you run round the house?"
"Oh!" said the form, "Titty's dead, and
Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the
broom sweeps, the door jars, and the
window creaks, and so I run round the
house."</p>

<p>"Then," said the walnut-tree, "I'll
shed my leaves," so the walnut-tree shed
all its beautiful green leaves. Now there
was a little bird perched on one of the
boughs of the tree, and when all the
leaves fell, it said: "Walnut-tree, why
do you shed your leaves?" "Oh!" said
the tree, "Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps,
the stool hops, and the broom sweeps,
the door jars, and the window creaks, the
old form runs round the house, and so
I shed my leaves."</p>

<p>"Then," said the little bird, "I'll
moult all my feathers," so he moulted
all his pretty feathers. Now there was
a little girl walking below, carrying a jug
of milk for her brothers' and sisters' supper,
and when she saw the poor little
bird moult all its feathers, she said:
"Little bird, why do you moult all your
feathers?" "Oh!" said the little bird,
"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the
stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the
door jars, and the window creaks, the
old form runs round the house, the
walnut-tree sheds its leaves, and so I
moult all my feathers."</p>

<p>"Then," said the little girl, "I'll spill
the milk," so she dropt the pitcher and
spilt the milk. Now there was an old
man just by on the top of a ladder
thatching a rick, and when he saw the
little girl spill the milk, he said: "Little
girl, what do you mean by spilling the
milk?&mdash;your little brothers and sisters
must go without their supper." Then
said the little girl: "Titty's dead, and
Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the
broom sweeps, the door jars, and the
window creaks, the old form runs round
the house, the walnut-tree sheds all its
leaves, the little bird moults all its
feathers, and so I spill the milk."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the old man, "then I'll
tumble off the ladder and break my
neck," so he tumbled off the ladder and
broke his neck; and when the old man
broke his neck, the great walnut-tree
fell down with a crash and upset the old
form and house, and the house falling
knocked the window out, and the window
knocked the door down, and the door
upset the broom, and the broom upset
the stool, and poor little Tatty Mouse
was buried beneath the ruins.</p>

<div class="hang1">"The Story of the Three Bears" is perhaps
the only instance in which a piece of literature
by a known English author is found
among accepted folk tales. It appeared in
Robert Southey's rambling miscellany,
<i>The Doctor</i> (1837). He may have taken it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
from an old tale, but no amount of investigation
has located any certain source. In
the most familiar versions the naughty old
woman gives place to a little girl whose
name is Goldenhair, Goldilocks, Silverhair,
or Silverlocks. The point to the story is
lessened by the change, but the popularity
of these modifications seems to suggest that
children prefer to have the ill-mannered old
woman turned into an attractive little girl.
Southey apparently was delighted with
efforts to bring his story into any form more
pleasing to the folk, and we find his son-in-law
saying that he was especially pleased
with a versification "by G. N. and published
especially for the amusement of 'little
people' lest in the volumes of <i>The Doctor</i>
it should 'escape their sight.'" However,
it would appear that teachers at least should
know this masterpiece in the only form in
which its author put it. To that end this
version of "The Three Bears" follows
Southey with the change of a single word.
At the head of the story he placed these
lines from Gascoyne:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"A tale which may content the minds<br />
Of learned men and grave philosophers."<br />
</div>


<h4><br />THE STORY OF THE THREE BEARS</h4>

<div class='center'>ROBERT SOUTHEY</div>

<p>Once upon a time there were Three
Bears who lived together in a house of
their own in a wood. One of them was a
Little, Small, Wee Bear; and one was a
Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a
Great, Huge Bear. They had each a
pot for their porridge; a little pot for the
Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized
pot for the Middle Bear; and a
great pot for the Great, Huge Bear.
And they had each a chair to sit in; a
little chair for the Little, Small, Wee
Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the
Middle Bear; and a great chair for the
Great, Huge Bear. And they had each
a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the
Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized
bed for the Middle Bear; and a great
bed for the Great, Huge Bear.</p>

<p>One day after they had made the porridge
for their breakfast and poured it
into their porridge-pots, they walked out
into the wood while the porridge was
cooling, that they might not burn their
mouths by beginning too soon to eat it.
And while they were walking, a little old
Woman came to the house. She could
not have been a good, honest old Woman;
for first she looked in at the window and
then she peeped in at the keyhole; and
seeing nobody in the house, she lifted the
latch. The door was not fastened, because
the Bears were good Bears, who did
nobody any harm and never suspected
that anybody would harm them. So the
little old Woman opened the door and
went in, and well pleased she was when
she saw the porridge on the table. If
she had been a good little old Woman,
she would have waited till the Bears
came home, and then perhaps they would
have asked her to breakfast, for they were
good Bears&mdash;a little rough or so, as the
manner of Bears is, but for all that very
good-natured and hospitable. But she
was an impudent, bad old Woman, and
set about helping herself.</p>

<p>So first she tasted the porridge of the
Great, Huge Bear, and that was too hot
for her; and she said a bad word about
that. And then she tasted the porridge
of the Middle Bear, and that was too cold
for her; and she said a bad word about
that too. And then she went to the porridge
of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and
tasted that; and that was neither too hot
nor too cold, but just right; and she liked
it so well that she ate it all up. But the
naughty old Woman said a bad word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
about the little porridge-pot because it
did not hold enough for her.</p>

<p>Then the little old Woman sat down in
the chair of the Great, Huge Bear, and
that was too hard for her. And then she
sat down in the chair of the Middle
Bear, and that was too soft for her.
And then she sat down in the chair of
the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and that was
neither too hard nor too soft, but just
right. So she seated herself in it, and
there she sat till the bottom of the chair
came out, and down she came, plump
upon the ground. And the naughty old
Woman said a wicked word about that too.</p>

<p>Then the little old Woman went upstairs
into the bed-chamber in which the
three Bears slept. And first she lay down
upon the bed of the Great, Huge Bear;
but that was too high at the head for her.
And next she lay down upon the bed of
the Middle Bear, and that was too high
at the foot for her. And then she lay
down upon the bed of the Little, Small,
Wee Bear, and that was neither too high
at the head nor at the foot, but just
right. So she covered herself up comfortably
and lay there till she fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p>By this time the Three Bears thought
their porridge would be cool enough, so
they came home to breakfast. Now the
little old Woman had left the spoon of
the Great, Huge Bear standing in his
porridge.</p>

<p>"<big>SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY
PORRIDGE!</big>" said the Great, Huge
Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.
And when the Middle Bear looked at his,
he saw that the spoon was standing in it
too. They were wooden spoons; if they
had been silver ones, the naughty old
Woman would have put them in her
pocket.</p>

<p>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY
PORRIDGE!" said the Middle Bear,
in his middle voice.</p>

<p>Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear
looked at his, and there was the spoon
in the porridge-pot, but the porridge was
all gone.</p>

<p>"<small>SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND
HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!</small>" said the Little, Small,
Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.</p>

<p>Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that
some one had entered their house and
eaten up the Little, Small, Wee Bear's
breakfast, began to look about them.
Now the little old Woman had not put
the hard cushion straight when she rose
from the chair of the Great, Huge Bear.</p>

<p>"<big>SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING
IN MY CHAIR!</big>" said the
Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough,
gruff voice.</p>

<p>And the little old Woman had squatted
down the soft cushion of the Middle
Bear.</p>

<p>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN
MY CHAIR!" said the Middle Bear, in
his middle voice.</p>

<p>And you know what the little old
Woman had done to the third chair.</p>

<p>"<small>SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR
AND HAS SAT THE BOTTOM OUT OF IT!</small>" said
the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little,
small, wee voice.</p>

<p>Then the three Bears thought it necessary
that they should make further
search; so they went upstairs into their
bed-chamber. Now the little old Woman
had pulled the pillow of the Great, Huge
Bear out of its place.</p>

<p>"<big>SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING
IN MY BED!</big>" said the Great, Huge
Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.</p>

<p>And the little old Woman had pulled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the bolster of the Middle Bear out of its
place.</p>

<p>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY
BED!" said the Middle Bear, in his
middle voice.</p>

<p>And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear
came to look at his bed, there was the
bolster in its right place, and the pillow
in its place upon the bolster; and upon
the pillow was the little old Woman's
ugly, dirty head,&mdash;which was not in its
place, for she had no business there.</p>

<p>"<small>SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,&mdash;AND
HERE SHE IS!</small>" said the Little,
Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee
voice.</p>

<p>The little old Woman had heard in her
sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of the
Great, Huge Bear; but she was so fast
asleep that it was no more to her than
the roaring of wind or the rumbling of
thunder. And she had heard the middle
voice of the Middle Bear, but it was only
as if she had heard some one speaking in
a dream. But when she heard the little,
small, wee voice of the Little, Small,
Wee Bear, it was so sharp and so shrill
that it awakened her at once. Up she
started; and when she saw the Three
Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled
herself out at the other and ran to the
window. Now the window was open,
because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears
as they were, always opened their bed-chamber
window when they got up in
the morning. Out the little old Woman
jumped; and whether she broke her neck
in the fall, or ran into the wood and was
lost there, or found her way out of the
wood and was taken up by the constable
and sent to the House of Correction for a
vagrant, as she was, I cannot tell. But
the Three Bears never saw anything more
of her.</p>

<div class="hang1">A noodle story is a droll, or comic story, that
follows the fortunes of very simple or stupid
characters. There are many noodle stories
among the favorites of the folk, and the
three immediately following are among
the best known. This version of "The
Three Sillies" was collected from oral
tradition in Suffolk, England. In the
original the dangerous tool was an ax, but
the collector informed Mr. Hartland, in
whose <i>English Fairy and Folk Tales</i> it is
reprinted, that she had found it was really
"a great big wooden mallet, as some one
had left sticking there when they'd been
<i>making-up</i> the beer." This change, following
the example of Jacobs, is made in the
text of the story. This particular droll is
widespread. Grimms' "Clever Elsie" is the
same story, and a French version, "The Six
Sillies," is in Lang's <i>Red Fairy Book</i>. A
very fine Italian version, called "Bastienelo,"
is given in Crane's <i>Italian Popular
Tales</i>. The tendency of people to "borrow
trouble" is so universal that stories illustrating
its ludicrous consequences have
always had wide appeal. Some details of
these variants are due to local environments.
For instance, in the Italian story
wine takes the place of beer, and it has
been pointed out that there are "borrowing
trouble" stories found in New York and
Ohio in which the thing feared is the heavy
iron door closing the mouth of the oven
which in pioneer days was built in by the
side of the fireplace.</div>


<h4><br />THE THREE SILLIES</h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was a farmer
and his wife who had one daughter, and
she was courted by a gentleman. Every
evening he used to come and see her,
and stop to supper at the farmhouse, and
the daughter used to be sent down into
the cellar to draw the beer for supper.
So one evening she had gone down to
draw the beer, and she happened to look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
up at the ceiling while she was drawing,
and she saw a mallet stuck in one of the
beams. It must have been there a long,
long time, but somehow or other she had
never noticed it before, and she began
a-thinking. And she thought it was very
dangerous to have that mallet there, for
she said to herself: "Suppose him and
me was to be married, and we was to
have a son, and he was to grow up to be
a man, and come down into the cellar
to draw the beer, like as I'm doing now,
and the mallet was to fall on his head
and kill him, what a dreadful thing it
would be!" And she put down the
candle and the jug, and sat herself down
and began a-crying.</p>

<p>Well, they began to wonder upstairs
how it was that she was so long drawing
the beer, and her mother went down to
see after her, and she found her sitting
on the settle crying, and the beer running
over the floor. "Why, whatever is the
matter?" said her mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!" says she, "look at that
horrid mallet! Suppose we was to be
married, and was to have a son, and he
was to grow up, and was to come down
to the cellar to draw the beer, and the
mallet was to fall on his head and kill
him, what a dreadful thing it would be!"</p>

<p>"Dear, dear! what a dreadful thing it
would be!" said the mother, and she sat
her down aside of the daughter and
started a-crying too.</p>

<p>Then after a bit the father began to
wonder that they didn't come back,
and he went down into the cellar to look
after them himself, and there they two
sat a-crying, and the beer running all
over the floor.</p>

<p>"Whatever is the matter?" says he.</p>

<p>"Why," says the mother, "look at
that horrid mallet. Just suppose, if our
daughter and her sweetheart was to be
married, and was to have a son, and he
was to grow up, and was to come down
into the cellar to draw the beer, and the
mallet was to fall on his head and kill
him, what a dreadful thing it would be!"</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, dear! so it would!" said
the father, and he sat himself down aside
of the other two, and started a-crying.</p>

<p>Now the gentleman got tired of stopping
up in the kitchen by himself, and at
last he went down into the cellar too, to
see what they were after; and there they
three sat a-crying side by side, and the
beer running all over the floor. And he
ran straight and turned the tap. Then
he said: "Whatever are you three doing,
sitting there crying, and letting the beer
run all over the floor?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" says the father, "look at that
horrid mallet! Suppose you and our
daughter was to be married, and was to
have a son, and he was to grow up, and
was to come down into the cellar to draw
the beer, and the mallet was to fall on
his head and kill him!" And then they
all started a-crying worse than before.</p>

<p>But the gentleman burst out a-laughing,
and reached up and pulled out the
mallet, and then he said: "I've traveled
many miles, and I never met three
such big sillies as you three before; and
now I shall start out on my travels
again, and when I can find three bigger
sillies than you three, then I'll come back
and marry your daughter." So he
wished them good-bye, and started off
on his travels, and left them all crying
because the girl had lost her sweetheart.</p>

<p>Well, he set out, and he traveled a long
way, and at last he came to a woman's
cottage that had some grass growing on
the roof. And the woman was trying
to get her cow to go up a ladder to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
grass, and the poor thing durst not go.
So the gentleman asked the woman what
she was doing. "Why, lookye," she
said, "look at all that beautiful grass.
I'm going to get the cow on to the roof
to eat it. She'll be quite safe, for I shall
tie a string round her neck, and pass it
down the chimney, and tie it to my wrist
as I go about the house, so she can't fall
off without my knowing it."</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor silly!" said the gentleman,
"you should cut the grass and
throw it down to the cow!" But the
woman thought it was easier to get the
cow up the ladder than to get the grass
down, so she pushed her and coaxed
her and got her up, and tied a string round
her neck, and passed it down the chimney,
and fastened it to her own wrist.
And the gentleman went on his way, but
he hadn't gone far when the cow tumbled
off the roof, and hung by the string tied
round her neck, and it strangled her.
And the weight of the cow tied to her
wrist pulled the woman up the chimney,
and she stuck fast half-way and was
smothered in the soot.</p>

<p>Well, that was one big silly.</p>

<p>And the gentleman went on and on,
and he went to an inn to stop the night,
and they were so full at the inn that they
had to put him in a double-bedded room,
and another traveller was to sleep in the
other bed. The other man was a very
pleasant fellow, and they got very friendly
together; but in the morning, when they
were both getting up, the gentleman
was surprised to see the other hang his
trousers on the knobs of the chest of
drawers and run across the room and try
to jump into them, and he tried over and
over again, and couldn't manage it; and
the gentleman wondered whatever he
was doing it for. At last he stopped and
wiped his face with his handkerchief.
"Oh, dear," he says, "I do think trousers
are the most awkwardest kind of clothes
that ever were. I can't think who could
have invented such things. It takes me
the best part of an hour to get into mine
every morning, and I get so hot! How
do you manage yours?" So the gentleman
burst out a-laughing, and showed
him how to put them on; and he was very
much obliged to him, and said he never
should have thought of doing it that way.</p>

<p>So that was another big silly.</p>

<p>Then the gentleman went on his
travels again; and he came to a village,
and outside the village there was a pond,
and round the pond was a crowd of
people. And they had got rakes, and
brooms, and pitchforks, reaching into
the pond; and the gentleman asked what
was the matter.</p>

<p>"Why," they said, "matter enough!
Moon's tumbled into the pond, and we
can't rake her out anyhow!"</p>

<p>So the gentleman burst out a-laughing,
and told them to look up into the sky,
and that it was only the shadow in the
water. But they wouldn't listen to him,
and abused him shamefully, and he got
away as quick as he could.</p>

<p>So there was a whole lot of sillies bigger
than the three sillies at home. So the
gentleman turned back home again and
married the farmer's daughter, and if
they didn't live happy for ever after,
that's nothing to do with you or me.</p>

<div class="hang1">There seemed to be a feeling common among
the folk that simple-minded persons were

Halliwell collection. "The humor lies in
the contrast between what Jack did and
what anybody 'with sense' knows he ought

Grimms' "Hans in Luck." A most striking
and popular Americanization of it is Sara
Cone Bryant's "The Story of Epaminondas
and His Auntie" in her <i>Stories to Tell to
Children</i>.</div>


<h4><br />LAZY JACK</h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was a boy
whose name was Jack, and he lived
with his mother on a dreary common.
They were very poor, and the old woman
got her living by spinning, but Jack was
so lazy that he would do nothing but bask
in the sun in the hot weather and sit by
the corner of the hearth in the winter
time. His mother could not persuade
him to do anything for her and was
obliged at last to tell him that if he did
not begin to work for his porridge she
would turn him out to get his living as
he could.</p>

<p>This threat at length roused Jack, and
he went out and hired himself for the day
to a neighboring farmer for a penny; but
as he was coming home, never having
had any money in his possession before,
he lost it in passing over a brook. "You
stupid boy," said his mother, "you should
have put it in your pocket."</p>

<p>"I'll do so another time," replied Jack.</p>

<p>The next day Jack went out again and
hired himself to a cowkeeper, who gave
him a jar of milk for his day's work.
Jack took the jar and put it into the large
pocket of his jacket, spilling it all long
before he got home. "Dear me!" said
the old woman; "you should have carried
it on your head."</p>

<p>"I'll do so another time," said Jack.</p>

<p>The following day Jack hired himself
again to a farmer, who agreed to give
him a cream cheese for his services. In
the evening Jack took the cheese and
went home with it on his head. By the
time he got home the cheese was completely
spoilt, part of it being lost and
part matted with his hair. "You stupid
lout," said his mother, "you should
have carried it very carefully in your
hands."</p>

<p>"I'll do so another time," replied Jack.</p>

<p>The day after this Jack again went out
and hired himself to a baker, who would
give him nothing for his work but a large
tomcat. Jack took the cat and began
carrying it very carefully in his hands,
but in a short time pussy scratched him
so much that he was compelled to let it go.
When he got home, his mother said to
him: "You silly fellow, you should have
tied it with a string and dragged it along
after you."</p>

<p>"I'll do so another time," said Jack.</p>

<p>The next day Jack hired himself to a
butcher, who rewarded his labors by the
handsome present of a shoulder of mutton.
Jack took the mutton, tied it to a
string, and trailed it along after him in
the dirt, so that by the time he had got
home the meat was completely spoilt.
His mother was this time quite out of
patience with him, for the next day was
Sunday, and she was obliged to content
herself with cabbage for her dinner.
"You ninney-hammer," said she to her
son, "you should have carried it on your
shoulder."</p>

<p>"I'll do so another time," replied Jack.</p>

<p>On the Monday Jack went once more
and hired himself to a cattle-keeper, who
gave him a donkey for his trouble. Although
Jack was very strong, he found
some difficulty in hoisting the donkey on
his shoulders, but at last he accomplished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
it and began walking slowly home with
his prize. Now it happened that in the
course of his journey there lived a rich
man with his only daughter, a beautiful
girl, but unfortunately deaf and dumb.
She had never laughed in her life, and the
doctors said she would never recover till
somebody made her laugh. This young
lady happened to be looking out of the
window when Jack was passing with the
donkey on his shoulders, the legs sticking
up in the air, and the sight was so comical
and strange that she burst out into a
great fit of laughter, and immediately
recovered her speech and hearing. Her
father was overjoyed, and fulfilled his
promise by marrying her to Jack, who was
thus made a rich gentleman. They lived
in a large house, and Jack's mother lived
with them in great happiness until she
died.</p>

<h4><br />THE STORY OF MR. VINEGAR</h4>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Vinegar lived in a vinegar
bottle. Now, one day when Mr.
Vinegar was from home and Mrs. Vinegar,
who was a very good housewife,
was busily sweeping her house, an
unlucky thump of the broom brought
the whole house clitter-clatter about her
ears. In a paroxysm of grief she rushed
forth to meet her husband. On seeing
him she exclaimed, "Oh, Mr. Vinegar,
Mr. Vinegar, we are ruined, we are
ruined: I have knocked the house down,
and it is all to pieces!"</p>

<p>Mr. Vinegar then said: "My dear, let
us see what can be done. Here is the
door; I will take it on my back, and we
will go forth to seek our fortune."</p>

<p>They walked all that day and at nightfall
entered a thick forest. They were
both excessively tired, and Mr. Vinegar
said: "My love, I will climb up into a
tree, drag up the door, and you shall
follow." He accordingly did so, and
they both stretched their weary limbs
on the door, and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night Mr. Vinegar
was disturbed by the sound of voices
beneath, and to his inexpressible dismay
perceived that a party of thieves were
met to divide their booty. "Here,
Jack," said one, "here's five pounds for
you; here, Bill, here's ten pounds for
you; here, Bob, here's three pounds for
you."</p>

<p>Mr. Vinegar could listen no longer;
his terror was so intense that he trembled
most violently and shook down the door
on their heads. Away scampered the
thieves, but Mr. Vinegar dared not quit
his retreat till broad daylight. He then
scrambled out of the tree and went to
lift up the door. What did he behold
but a number of golden guineas! "Come
down, Mrs. Vinegar," he cried; "come
down, I say; our fortune's made! Come
down, I say."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vinegar got down as fast as she
could and saw the money with equal
delight. "Now, my dear," said she,
"I'll tell you what you shall do. There
is a fair at the neighboring town; you
shall take these forty guineas and buy a
cow. I can make butter and cheese,
which you shall sell at market, and we
shall then be able to live very comfortably."</p>

<p>Mr. Vinegar joyfully assents, takes the
money, and goes off to the fair. When
he arrived, he walked up and down, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
at length saw a beautiful red cow. It
was an excellent milker and perfect in
every respect. "Oh," thought Mr. Vinegar,
"if I had but that cow, I should be
the happiest man alive." So he offers
the forty guineas for the cow, and the
owner declaring that, as he was a friend,
he'd oblige him, the bargain was made.
Proud of his purchase, he drove the cow
backwards and forwards to show it.
By-and-by he saw a man playing the
bagpipes&mdash;<i>tweedle-dum, tweedle-dee</i>. The
children followed him about, and he
appeared to be pocketing money on all
sides. "Well," thought Mr. Vinegar,
"if I had but that beautiful instrument,
I should be the happiest man alive&mdash;my
fortune would be made." So he went
up to the man. "Friend," says he,
"what a beautiful instrument that is,
and what a deal of money you must
make."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the man, "I make a
great deal of money, to be sure, and it
is a wonderful instrument."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Mr. Vinegar, "how I
should like to possess it!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, "as you are a
friend, I don't much mind parting with
it; you shall have it for that red cow."</p>

<p>"Done!" said the delighted Mr. Vinegar.
So the beautiful red cow was
given for the bagpipes. He walked up
and down with his purchase; but in vain
he attempted to play a tune, and instead
of pocketing pence, the boys followed
him hooting, laughing, and pelting.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Vinegar, his fingers grew very
cold, and heartily ashamed and mortified,
he was leaving the town, when he
met a man with a fine thick pair of
gloves. "Oh, my fingers are so very
cold," said Mr. Vinegar to himself. "If
I had but those beautiful gloves I should
be the happiest man alive." He went
up to the man, and said to him: "Friend,
you seem to have a capital pair of gloves
there."</p>

<p>"Yes, truly," cried the man; "and my
hands are as warm as possible this cold
November day."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Vinegar, "I should
like to have them."</p>

<p>"What will you give?" said the man;
"as you are a friend, I don't much mind
letting you have them for those bagpipes."</p>

<p>"Done!" cried Mr. Vinegar. He put
on the gloves, and felt perfectly happy as
he trudged homewards.</p>

<p>At last he grew very tired, when he
saw a man coming towards him with a
good stout stick in his hand. "Oh,"
said Mr. Vinegar, "that I but had that
stick! I should then be the happiest
man alive." He accosted the man:
"Friend! what a rare good stick you have
got."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the man; "I have used it
for many a long mile, and a good friend
it has been; but if you have a fancy for
it, as you are a friend, I don't mind giving
it to you for that pair of gloves." Mr.
Vinegar's hands were so warm, and his
legs so tired, that he gladly exchanged.</p>

<p>As he drew near to the wood where he
had left his wife, he heard a parrot on a
tree calling out his name: "Mr. Vinegar,
you foolish man, you blockhead, you
simpleton; you went to the fair and laid
out all your money in buying a cow.
Not content with that, you changed it
for bagpipes, on which you could not
play and which were not worth one-tenth
of the money. You fool, you&mdash;you had
no sooner got the bagpipes than you
changed them for the gloves, which were
not worth one-quarter of the money;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and when you had got the gloves, you
changed them for a poor miserable stick;
and now for your forty guineas, cow, bagpipes,
and gloves, you have nothing to
show but that poor miserable stick,
which you might have cut in any hedge."
On this the bird laughed immoderately,
and Mr. Vinegar, falling into a violent
rage, threw the stick at its head. The
stick lodged in the tree, and he returned
to his wife without money, cow, bagpipes,
gloves, or stick, and she instantly
gave him such a sound cudgelling that
she almost broke every bone in his skin.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_157" id="Note_157">157</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">One of the greatest favorites among nursery
tales is the story of that Jack who showed
"an inquiring mind, a great courage and
enterprise," and who climbed the ladder of
fortune when he mounted his bean-stalk.
The traditional versions of this story are
nearly all crude and unsatisfactory, as are
those of many of the English tales. Joseph
Jacobs made a remarkably fine literary
version in his <i>English Fairy Tales</i> from
memories of his Australian childhood. He
materially shortens the story by omitting
the fairy lady, who, he suggests, was put
in "to prevent the tale becoming an encouragement
to theft." He also made Jack's
character more consistent by making him
more sympathetic and kind at the beginning
and less of a "ne'er-do-well," though
the noodle element in the selling of the cow
could not be eliminated. Andrew Lang,
in his <i>Green Fairy Book</i>, gives an excellent
version of the story in its most extended
form. Both the versions mentioned introduce,
when the giant comes in, the formula
generally associated with "Jack the Giant
Killer":</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Fee-fi-fo-fum,<br />
I smell the blood of an Englishman,<br />
Be he alive, or be he dead,<br />
I'll grind his bones to make my bread."<br />
</div>

<div class='hang1'><br />The version chosen for use here contains
the elements of the story most familiar to
past generations and is probably as near
the commoner oral traditions as it is possible
to secure. It is taken from Miss Mulock's
<i>The Fairy Book</i>, a very fine selection of
tales, first published in 1863, and still
widely used. Miss Muloch (Dinah Maria
Craik, 1826-1887) is best known as the
author of the popular novel <i>John Halifax,
Gentleman</i>.</div>


<h4><br />JACK AND THE BEAN-STALK</h4>

<p>In the days of King Alfred there lived
a poor woman, whose cottage was in a
remote country village, many miles from
London. She had been a widow some
years, and had an only child named Jack,
whom she indulged so much that he
never paid the least attention to anything
she said, but was indolent, careless,
and extravagant. His follies were not
owing to a bad disposition, but to his
mother's foolish partiality. By degrees
he spent all that she had&mdash;scarcely anything
remained but a cow.</p>

<p>One day, for the first time in her life,
she reproached him: "Cruel, cruel boy!
you have at last brought me to beggary.
I have not money enough to purchase
even a bit of bread; nothing now remains
to sell but my poor cow! I am sorry
to part with her; it grieves me sadly, but
we cannot starve."</p>

<p>For a few minutes Jack felt remorse,
but it was soon over, and he began asking
his mother to let him sell the cow at
the next village, teasing her so much
that she at last consented. As he was
going along he met a butcher, who
inquired why he was driving the cow
from home. Jack replied that he was
going to sell her. The butcher held some
curious beans in his hat; they were of
various colors, and attracted Jack's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
attention. This did not pass unnoticed
by the man, who, knowing Jack's easy
temper, thought now was the time to
take an advantage of it; and, determined
not to let slip so good an opportunity,
asked what was the price of the
cow, offering at the same time all the
beans in his hat for her. The silly boy
could not conceal the pleasure he felt
at what he supposed so great an offer.
The bargain was struck instantly, and
the cow exchanged for a few paltry
beans. Jack made the best of his way
home, calling aloud to his mother before
he reached the door, thinking to surprise
her.</p>

<p>When she saw the beans, and heard
Jack's account, her patience quite forsook
her. She tossed the beans out of the
window, where they fell on the garden-bed
below. Then she threw her apron
over her head, and cried bitterly. Jack
attempted to console her, but in vain,
and, not having anything to eat, they
both went supperless to bed.</p>

<p>Jack awoke early in the morning, and
seeing something uncommon darkening
the window of his bed-chamber, ran
down stairs into the garden, where he
found some of the beans had taken
root and sprung up surprisingly. The
stalks were of an immense thickness, and
had twined together until they formed a
ladder like a chain, and so high that the
top appeared to be lost in the clouds.</p>

<p>Jack was an adventurous lad; he
determined to climb up to the top, and
ran to tell his mother, not doubting but
that she would be equally pleased with
himself. She declared he should not
go; said it would break her heart if
he did; entreated and threatened, but
all in vain. Jack set out, and after
climbing for some hours reached the top
of the bean-stalk, quite exhausted. Looking
around, he found himself in a strange
country. It appeared to be a barren
desert; not a tree, shrub, house, or living
creature was to be seen; here and there
were scattered fragments of stone, and
at unequal distances small heaps of earth
were loosely thrown together.</p>

<p>Jack seated himself pensively upon a
block of stone and thought of his mother.
He reflected with sorrow upon his disobedience
in climbing the bean-stalk
against her will, and concluded that he
must die of hunger. However, he walked
on, hoping to see a house where he might
beg something to eat and drink. He
did not find it; but he saw at a distance
a beautiful lady walking all alone. She
was elegantly clad, and carried a white
wand, at the top of which sat a peacock
of pure gold.</p>

<p>Jack, who was a gallant fellow, went
straight up to her, when, with a bewitching
smile, she asked him how he came
there. He told her all about the bean-stalk.
The lady answered him by a
question, "Do you remember your father,
young man?"</p>

<p>"No, madam; but I am sure there is
some mystery about him, for when I
name him to my mother she always
begins to weep and will tell me nothing."</p>

<p>"She dare not," replied the lady, "but
I can and will. For know, young man,
that I am a fairy, and was your father's
guardian. But fairies are bound by
laws as well as mortals; and by an error
of mine I lost my power for a term of
years, so that I was unable to succor
your father when he most needed it,
and he died." Here the fairy looked so
sorrowful that Jack's heart warmed to
her, and he begged her earnestly to tell
him more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will; only you must promise to
obey me in everything, or you will
perish yourself."</p>

<p>Jack was brave, and, besides, his
fortunes were so bad they could not
well be worse,&mdash;so he promised.</p>

<p>The fairy continued: "Your father,
Jack, was a most excellent, amiable,
generous man. He had a good wife,
faithful servants, plenty of money; but
he had one misfortune&mdash;a false friend.
This was a giant, whom he had succored
in misfortune, and who returned his
kindness by murdering him and seizing
on all his property; also making your
mother take a solemn oath that she
would never tell you anything about
your father, or he would murder both
her and you. Then he turned her off
with you in her arms, to wander about
the wide world as she might. I could
not help her, as my power only returned
on the day you went to sell your cow.</p>

<p>"It was I," added the fairy, "who
impelled you to take the beans, who
made the bean-stalk grow, and inspired
you with the desire to climb up it to
this strange country; for it is here the
wicked giant lives who was your father's
destroyer. It is you who must avenge
him, and rid the world of a monster who
never will do anything but evil. I will
assist you. You may lawfully take
possession of his house and all his riches,
for everything he has belonged to your
father, and is therefore yours. Now,
farewell! Do not let your mother know
you are acquainted with your father's
history; this is my command, and if
you disobey me you will suffer for it.
Now go."</p>

<p>Jack asked where he was to go.</p>

<p>"Along the direct road, till you see
the house where the giant lives. You
must then act according to your own
just judgment, and I will guide you if
any difficulty arises. Farewell!"</p>

<p>She bestowed on the youth a benignant
smile, and vanished.</p>

<p>Jack pursued his journey. He walked
on till after sunset, when, to his great
joy, he espied a large mansion. A plain-looking
woman was at the door. He
accosted her, begging she would give
him a morsel of bread and a night's
lodging. She expressed the greatest surprise,
and said it was quite uncommon
to see a human being near their house;
for it was well known that her husband
was a powerful giant, who would never
eat anything but human flesh, if he could
possibly get it; that he would walk
fifty miles to procure it, usually being
out the whole day for that purpose.</p>

<p>This account greatly terrified Jack,
but still he hoped to elude the giant,
and therefore he again entreated the
woman to take him in for one night
only, and hide him where she thought
proper. She at last suffered herself to
be persuaded, for she was of a compassionate
and generous disposition, and
took him into the house. First, they
entered a fine large hall, magnificently
furnished; they then passed through
several spacious rooms, in the same style
of grandeur; but all appeared forsaken
and desolate. A long gallery came next,
it was very dark, just light enough to
show that instead of a wall on one side,
there was a grating of iron which parted
off a dismal dungeon, from whence
issued the groans of those victims whom
the cruel giant reserved in confinement
for his own voracious appetite.</p>

<p>Poor Jack was half dead with fear, and
would have given the world to have been
with his mother again, for he now began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to doubt if he should ever see her more;
he even mistrusted the good woman, and
thought she had let him into the house
for no other purpose than to lock him
up among the unfortunate people in the
dungeon. However, she bade Jack sit
down, and gave him plenty to eat and
drink; and he, not seeing anything to
make him uncomfortable, soon forgot
his fear, and was just beginning to enjoy
himself, when he was startled by a loud
knocking at the outer door, which made
the whole house shake.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's the giant; and if he sees
you he will kill you and me too," cried
the poor woman, trembling all over.
"What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Hide me in the oven," cried Jack,
now as bold as a lion at the thought of
being face to face with his father's cruel
murderer. So he crept into the oven&mdash;for
there was no fire near it&mdash;and listened
to the giant's loud voice and heavy step
as he went up and down the kitchen
scolding his wife. At last he seated
himself at the table, and Jack, peeping
through a crevice in the oven, was
amazed to see what a quantity of food
he devoured. It seemed as if he never
would have done eating and drinking;
but he did at last, and, leaning back,
called to his wife in a voice like thunder:</p>

<p>"Bring me my hen!"</p>

<p>She obeyed, and placed upon the
table a very beautiful live hen.</p>

<p>"Lay!" roared the giant, and the hen
laid immediately an egg of solid gold.</p>

<p>"Lay another!" and every time the
giant said this the hen laid a larger egg
than before.</p>

<p>He amused himself a long time with
his hen, and then sent his wife to bed,
while he fell asleep by the fireside, and
snored like the roaring of cannon.</p>

<p>As soon as he was asleep Jack crept
out of the oven, seized the hen, and ran
off with her. He got safely out of the
house, and finding his way along the
road he had come, reached the top of
the bean-stalk, which he descended in
safety.</p>

<p>His mother was overjoyed to see
him. She thought he had come to some
ill end.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, mother. Look here!"
and he showed her the hen. "Now lay!"
and the hen obeyed him as readily as
the giant, and laid as many golden eggs
as he desired.</p>

<p>These eggs being sold, Jack and his
mother got plenty of money, and for
some months lived very happily together;
till Jack got another great longing to
climb the bean-stalk and carry away
some more of the giant's riches. He
had told his mother of his adventure,
but had been very careful not to say
a word about his father. He thought
of his journey again and again, but still
he could not summon resolution enough
to break it to his mother, being well
assured that she would endeavor to
prevent his going. However, one day
he told her boldly that he must take
another journey up the bean-stalk. She
begged and prayed him not to think of
it, and tried all in her power to dissuade
him. She told him that the giant's wife
would certainly know him again, and
that the giant would desire nothing
better than to get him into his power,
that he might put him to a cruel death
in order to be revenged for the loss of
his hen. Jack, finding that all his arguments
were useless, ceased speaking,
though resolved to go at all events. He
had a dress prepared which would disguise
him, and something to color his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
skin. He thought it impossible for any
one to recollect him in this dress.</p>

<p>A few mornings after, he rose very
early, and, unperceived by any one,
climbed the bean-stalk a second time.
He was greatly fatigued when he reached
the top, and very hungry. Having
rested some time on one of the stones,
he pursued his journey to the giant's
mansion, which he reached late in the
evening. The woman was at the door
as before. Jack addressed her, at the
same time telling her a pitiful tale, and
requesting that she would give him
some victuals and drink, and also a
night's lodging.</p>

<p>She told him (what he knew before
very well) about her husband's being a
powerful and cruel giant, and also that
she had one night admitted a poor,
hungry, friendless boy; that the little
ungrateful fellow had stolen one of the
giant's treasures; and ever since that
her husband had been worse than before,
using her very cruelly, and continually
upbraiding her with being the cause of
his misfortune.</p>

<p>Jack felt sorry for her, but confessed
nothing, and did his best to persuade
her to admit him, but found it a very
hard task. At last she consented, and
as she led the way, Jack observed that
everything was just as he had found it
before. She took him into the kitchen,
and after he had done eating and drinking,
she hid him in an old lumber-closet.</p>

<p>The giant returned at the usual time,
and walked in so heavily that the house
was shaken to its foundation. He seated
himself by the fire, and soon after
exclaimed, "Wife, I smell fresh meat!"</p>

<p>The wife replied it was the crows,
which had brought a piece of raw meat
and left it at the top of the house. While
supper was preparing, the giant was very
ill-tempered and impatient, frequently
lifting up his hand to strike his wife
for not being quick enough. He was
also continually upbraiding her with the
loss of his wonderful hen.</p>

<p>At last, having ended his supper, he
cried, "Give me something to amuse
me&mdash;my harp or my money-bags."</p>

<p>"Which will you have, my dear?"
said the wife humbly.</p>

<p>"My money-bags, because they are
the heaviest to carry," thundered he.</p>

<p>She brought them, staggering under
the weight; two bags&mdash;one filled with
new guineas, and the other with new
shillings. She emptied them out on the
table, and the giant began counting
them in great glee. "Now you may
go to bed, you old fool." So the wife
crept away.</p>

<p>Jack from his hiding-place watched
the counting of the money, which he
knew was his poor father's, and wished
it was his own; it would give him much
less trouble than going about selling the
golden eggs. The giant, little thinking
he was so narrowly observed, reckoned
it all up, and then replaced it in the two
bags, which he tied up very carefully
and put beside his chair, with his little
dog to guard them. At last he fell
asleep as before, and snored so loud
that Jack compared his noise to the
roaring of the sea in a high wind when
the tide is coming in.</p>

<p>At last Jack, concluding all secure,
stole out, in order to carry off the two
bags of money; but just as he laid his
hands upon one of them, the little dog,
which he had not seen before, started
from under the giant's chair and barked
most furiously. Instead of endeavoring
to escape, Jack stood still, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
expecting his enemy to awake every
instant. Contrary, however, to his
expectation, the giant continued in a
sound sleep, and Jack, seeing a piece of
meat, threw it to the dog, who at once
ceased barking and began to devour it.
So Jack carried off the bags, one on each
shoulder, but they were so heavy that
it took him two whole days to descend
the bean-stalk and get back to his
mother's door.</p>

<p>When he came he found the cottage
deserted. He ran from one room to
another, without being able to find any
one. He then hastened into the village,
hoping to see some of the neighbors who
could inform him where he could find
his mother. An old woman at last
directed him to a neighboring house,
where she was ill of a fever. He was
greatly shocked at finding her apparently
dying, and blamed himself bitterly as the
cause of it all. However, at sight of her
dear son, the poor woman revived, and
slowly recovered health. Jack gave her
his two money-bags. They had the cottage
rebuilt and well furnished, and lived
happier than they had ever done before.</p>

<p>For three years Jack heard no more of
the bean-stalk, but he could not forget
it, though he feared making his mother
unhappy. It was in vain endeavoring
to amuse himself; he became thoughtful,
and would arise at the first dawn of day,
and sit looking at the bean-stalk for
hours together.</p>

<p>His mother saw that something preyed
upon his mind, and endeavored to discover
the cause; but Jack knew too well
what the consequence would be should
she succeed. He did his utmost, therefore,
to conquer the great desire he had
for another journey up the bean-stalk.
Finding, however, that his inclination
grew too powerful for him, he began to
make secret preparations for his journey.
He got ready a new disguise, better and
more complete than the former; and when
summer came, on the longest day he
woke as soon as it was light, and, without
telling his mother, ascended the bean-stalk.
He found, the road, journey, etc.,
much as it was on the two former times.
He arrived at the giant's mansion in
the evening, and found the wife standing,
as usual, at the door. Jack had disguised
himself so completely that she did not
appear to have the least recollection of
him; however, when he pleaded hunger
and poverty in order to gain admittance,
he found it very difficult indeed to persuade
her. At last he prevailed, and was
concealed in the copper.</p>

<p>When the giant returned, he said
furiously, "I smell fresh meat!" But
Jack felt quite composed, as he had
said so before and had been soon satisfied.
However, the giant started up suddenly,
and, notwithstanding all his wife could
say, he searched all round the room.
Whilst this was going forward, Jack was
exceedingly terrified, wishing himself at
home a thousand times; but when the
giant approached the copper, and put
his hand on the lid, Jack thought his
death was certain. However, nothing
happened; for the giant did not take
the trouble to lift up the lid, but sat
down shortly by the fireside and began
to eat his enormous supper. When he
had finished, he commanded his wife to
fetch down his harp.</p>

<p>Jack peeped under the copper lid and
saw a most beautiful harp. The giant
placed it on the table, said, "Play!"
and it played of its own accord, without
anybody touching it, the most exquisite
music imaginable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack, who was a very good musician,
was delighted, and more anxious to get
this than any other of his enemy's treasures.
But the giant not being particularly
fond of music, the harp had only
the effect of lulling him to sleep earlier
than usual. As for the wife, she had
gone to bed as soon as ever she could.</p>

<p>As soon as he thought all was safe,
Jack got out of the copper, and, seizing
the harp, was eagerly running off with
it. But the harp was enchanted by a
fairy, and as soon as it found itself in
strange hands, it called out loudly, just
as if it had been alive, "Master! Master!"</p>

<p>The giant awoke, started up, and saw
Jack scampering away as fast as his
legs could carry him.</p>

<p>"Oh, you villain! It is you who have
robbed me of my hen and my money-bags,
and now you are stealing my
harp also. Wait till I catch you, and
I'll eat you up alive!"</p>

<p>"Very well; try!" shouted Jack, who
was not a bit afraid, for he saw the
giant was so tipsy he could hardly stand,
much less run; and he himself had
young legs and a clear conscience, which
carry a man a long way. So, after leading
the giant a considerable race, he
contrived to be first at the top of the
bean-stalk, and then scrambled down
it as fast as he could, the harp playing
all the while the most melancholy music,
till he said, "Stop"; and it stopped.</p>

<p>Arrived at the bottom, he found his
mother sitting at her cottage door,
weeping silently.</p>

<p>"Here, mother, don't cry; just give
me a hatchet; make haste." For he
knew there was not a moment to spare.
He saw the giant beginning to descend
the bean-stalk.</p>

<p>However, it was too late&mdash;the monster's
ill deeds had come to an end.
Jack with his hatchet cut the bean-stalk
close off at the root; the giant
fell headlong into the garden, and was
killed on the spot.</p>

<p>Instantly the fairy appeared and
explained everything to Jack's mother,
begging her to forgive Jack, who was
his father's own son for bravery and
generosity, and who would be sure to
make her happy for the rest of her days.</p>

<p>So all ended well, and nothing was
ever more heard or seen of the wonderful
bean-stalk.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_158" id="Note_158">158</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Those wonder stories that concern themselves
with giants or with very little people have
always been favorites with children. Of
the little heroes Tom Thumb has always
held the center of the stage. His adventures
in one form or another are in the folk
tales of most European countries. He has
the honor of being the subject of a monograph
by the great French scholar Gaston
Paris. Hans Christian Andersen turned him
into a delightful little girl in his derivative
story of "Thumbelina." The English version
of "Tom Thumb" seems to have been
printed first in ballad form in the seventeenth
century, and later in many chapbook
versions in prose. Its plot takes the form
of a succession of marvelous accidents by
land and sea, limited only by the inventive
ingenuity of the story-teller. "According
to popular tradition Tom Thumb died at
Lincoln.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was a little blue
flagstone in the pavement of the Minster
which was shown as Tom Thumb's monument,
and the country folks never failed
to marvel at it when they came to church
on the Assize Sunday; but during some of
the modern repairs which have been
inflicted on that venerable building, the flagstone
was displaced and lost, to the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
discomfiture of the holiday visitants."
Thus wrote an ancient and learned scholar
in illustration of the tendency to give a
local habitation and a name to our favorite
fancies. The version of the story given by
Miss Mulock in her <i>Fairy Book</i> is the one
used here. It follows closely the rambling
events of the various chapbook and ballad
versions.</div>


<h4><br />TOM THUMB</h4>

<p>In the days of King Arthur, Merlin, the
most learned enchanter of his time, was
on a journey; and being very weary,
stopped one day at the cottage of an
honest ploughman to ask for refreshment.
The ploughman's wife with great
civility immediately brought him some
milk in a wooden bowl and some brown
bread on a wooden platter.</p>

<p>Merlin could not help observing that
although everything within the cottage
was particularly neat and clean and in
good order, the ploughman and his wife
had the most sorrowful air imaginable;
so he questioned them on the cause of
their melancholy and learned that they
were very miserable because they had
no children.</p>

<p>The poor woman declared with tears
in her eyes that she should be the happiest
creature in the world if she had a
son, although he were no bigger than
his father's thumb.</p>

<p>Merlin was much amused with the
notion of a boy no bigger than a man's
thumb, and as soon as he returned home
he sent for the queen of the fairies (with
whom he was very intimate) and related
to her the desire of the ploughman and
his wife to have a son the size of his
father's thumb. She liked the plan
exceedingly and declared their wish
should be speedily granted. Accordingly
the ploughman's wife had a son,
who in a few minutes grew as tall as his
father's thumb.</p>

<p>The queen of the fairies came in at
the window as the mother was sitting
up in bed admiring the child. Her
majesty kissed the infant and, giving
it the name of Tom Thumb, immediately
summoned several fairies from
Fairyland to clothe her new little favorite.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown;<br />
His shirt it was by spiders spun;<br />
With doublet wove of thistledown,<br />
His trousers up with points were done;<br />
His stockings, of apple-rind, they tie<br />
With eye-lash plucked from his mother's eye,<br />
His shoes were made of a mouse's skin,<br />
Nicely tann'd with hair within."<br />
</div>

<p>Tom was never any bigger than his
father's thumb, which was not a large
thumb either; but as he grew older he
became very cunning, for which his
mother did not sufficiently correct him,
and by this ill quality he was often
brought into difficulties. For instance,
when he had learned to play with other
boys for cherry-stones and had lost all
his own, he used to creep into the boys'
bags, fill his pockets, and come out again
to play. But one day as he was getting
out of a bag of cherry-stones, the boy to
whom it belonged chanced to see him.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha, my little Tom Thumb!" said
he, "have I caught you at your bad tricks
at last? Now I will reward you for
thieving." Then he drew the string
tight around Tom's neck and shook the
bag. The cherry-stones bruised Tom
Thumb's legs, thighs, and body sadly,
which made him beg to be let out and
promise never to be guilty of such things
any more.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Tom's mother was
making a batter-pudding, and that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
might see how she mixed it, he climbed on
the edge of the bowl; but his foot happening
to slip, he fell over head and ears into
the batter. His mother not observing
him, stirred him into the pudding and
popped him into the pot to boil. The
hot water made Tom kick and struggle;
and the mother, seeing the pudding jump
up and down in such a furious manner,
thought it was bewitched; and a tinker
coming by just at the time, she quickly
gave him the pudding. He put it into
his budget and walked on.</p>

<p>As soon as Tom could get the batter
out of his mouth he began to cry aloud,
and so frightened the poor tinker that he
flung the pudding over the hedge and ran
away from it as fast as he could. The
pudding being broken to pieces by the
fall, Tom was released, and walked home
to his mother, who gave him a kiss and
put him to bed.</p>

<p>Tom Thumb's mother once took him
with her when she went to milk the cow;
and it being a very windy day, she tied
him with a needleful of thread to a thistle,
that he might not be blown away. The
cow, liking his oak-leaf hat, took him
and the thistle up at one mouthful.
While the cow chewed the thistle, Tom,
terrified at her great teeth, which seemed
ready to crush him to pieces, roared,
"Mother, mother!" as loud as he could
bawl.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Tommy, my dear
Tommy?" said the mother.</p>

<p>"Here, mother, here in the red cow's
mouth."</p>

<p>The mother began to cry and wring
her hands; but the cow, surprised at
such odd noises in her throat, opened
her mouth and let him drop out. His
mother clapped him into her apron and
ran home with him.</p>

<p>Tom's father made him a whip of a
barley straw to drive the cattle with, and
one day when he was in the field he
slipped into a deep furrow. A raven
flying over picked him up with a grain
of corn and flew with him to the top
of a giant's castle by the seaside, where
he left him; and old Grumbo, the giant,
coming soon after to walk upon his
terrace, swallowed Tom like a pill,
clothes and all.</p>

<p>Tom presently made the giant very
uncomfortable, and he threw him up
into the sea. A great fish then swallowed
him. The fish was soon after
caught, and sent as a present to King
Arthur. When it was cut open, everybody
was delighted with little Tom
Thumb. The king made him his dwarf;
he was the favorite of the whole court,
and by his merry pranks often amused
the queen and the knights of the Round
Table.</p>

<p>The king, when he rode on horse-back,
frequently took Tom in his hand; and
if a shower of rain came on, he used to
creep into the king's waist-coat pocket
and sleep till the rain was over. The
king also sometimes questioned Tom concerning
his parents; and when Tom
informed his majesty they were very
poor people, the king led him into his
treasury and told him he should pay his
friends a visit and take with him as
much money as he could carry. Tom
procured a little purse, and putting a
threepenny piece into it, with much
labor and difficulty got it upon his back;
and, after travelling two days and nights,
arrived at his father's house.</p>

<p>When his mother met him at the door,
he was almost tired to death, having in
forty-eight hours traveled almost half
a mile with a huge silver threepence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
upon his back. Both his parents were
glad to see him, especially when he had
brought such an amazing sum of money
with him. They placed him in a walnut-shell
by the fireside and feasted him for
three days upon a hazel-nut, which made
him sick, for a whole nut usually served
him for a month.</p>

<p>Tom got well, but could not travel
because it had rained; therefore his
mother took him in her hand, and with
one puff blew him into King Arthur's
court, where Tom entertained the king,
queen, and nobility at tilts and tournaments,
at which he exerted himself so
much that he brought on a fit of sickness,
and his life was despaired of.</p>

<p>At this juncture the queen of the fairies
came in a chariot, drawn by flying mice,
placed Tom by her side, and drove
through the air without stopping till
they arrived at her palace. After restoring
him to health and permitting him
to enjoy all the gay diversions of Fairyland,
she commanded a fair wind, and,
placing Tom before it, blew him straight
to the court of King Arthur. But just
as Tom should have alighted in the
courtyard of the palace, the cook happened
to pass along with the king's
great bowl of furmenty (King Arthur
loved furmenty), and poor Tom Thumb
fell plump into the middle of it and
splashed the hot furmenty into the cook's
eyes. Down went the bowl.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" cried Tom.</p>

<p>"Murder! murder!" bellowed the cook;
and away poured the king's nice furmenty
into the kennel.</p>

<p>The cook was a red-faced, cross fellow,
and swore to the king that Tom had
done it out of mere mischief; so he was
taken up, tried, and sentenced to be
beheaded. Tom hearing this dreadful
sentence and seeing a miller stand by
with his mouth wide open, he took a
good spring and jumped down the miller's
throat, unperceived by all, even the
miller himself.</p>

<p>Tom being lost, the court broke up,
and away went the miller to his mill.
But Tom did not leave him long at rest;
he began to roll and tumble about, so
that the miller thought himself bewitched
and sent for a doctor. When the doctor
came, Tom began to dance and sing.
The doctor was as much frightened as
the miller and sent in great haste for
five more doctors and twenty learned
men.</p>

<p>While all these were debating upon
the affair, the miller (for they were very
tedious) happened to yawn, and Tom,
taking the opportunity, made another
jump and alighted on his feet in the
middle of the table. The miller, provoked
to be thus tormented by such a
little creature, fell into a great passion,
caught hold of Tom, and threw him out
of the window into the river. A large
salmon swimming by snapped him up in
a minute. The salmon was soon caught
and sold in the market to a steward of
a lord. The lord, thinking it an uncommonly
fine fish, made a present of it to
the king, who ordered it to be dressed
immediately. When the cook cut open
the salmon he found poor Tom and ran
with him directly to the king; but the
king, being busy with state affairs, desired
that he might be brought another day.</p>

<p>The cook, resolving to keep him safely
this time, as he had so lately given him
the slip, clapped him into a mouse-trap
and left him to amuse himself by peeping
through the wires for a whole week.
When the king sent for him, he forgave
him for throwing down the furmenty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
ordered him new clothes, and knighted
him.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"His shirt was made of butterflies' wings;<br />
His boots were made of chicken skins,<br />
His coat and breeches were made with pride,<br />
A tailor's needle hung by his side;<br />
A mouse for a horse he used to ride."<br />
</div>

<p>Thus dressed and mounted, he rode
a-hunting with the king and nobility,
who all laughed heartily at Tom and his
prancing steed. As they rode by a farm-house
one day, a cat jumped from behind
the door, seized the mouse and little Tom,
and began to devour the mouse; however,
Tom boldly drew his sword and
attacked the cat, who then let him fall.
The king and his nobles, seeing Tom
falling, went to his assistance, and one
of the lords caught him in his hat; but
poor Tom was sadly scratched, and his
clothes were torn by the claws of the
cat. In this condition he was carried
home, and a bed of down was made for
him in a little ivory cabinet.</p>

<p>The queen of the fairies came and
took him again to Fairyland, where she
kept him for some years; and then,
dressing him in bright green, sent him
flying once more through the air to the
earth, in the days of King Thunstone.
The people flocked far and near to look
at him; and the king, before whom he
was carried, asked him who he was,
whence he came, and where he lived?
Tom answered:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"My name is Tom Thumb;<br />
From the fairies I come;<br />
When King Arthur shone,<br />
This court was my home;<br />
In me he delighted;<br />
By him I was knighted.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did you ever hear of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sir Thomas Thumb?"</span><br />
</div>

<p>The king was so charmed with this
address that he ordered a little chair to
be made, in order that Tom might sit
on his table, and also a palace of gold a
span high with a door an inch wide, for
little Tom to live in. He also gave him
a coach drawn by six small mice. This
made the queen angry, because she had
not a new coach too; therefore, resolving
to ruin Tom, she complained to the king
that he had behaved very insolently to
her. The king sent for him in a rage.
Tom, to escape his fury, crept into an
empty snail-shell and there lay till he
was almost starved; then, peeping out
of the hole, he saw a fine butterfly settle
on the ground. He then ventured out,
and getting astride, the butterfly took
wing and mounted into the air with little
Tom on his back. Away he flew from
field to field, from tree to tree, till at
last he flew to the king's court. The
king, queen, and nobles all strove to
catch the butterfly, but could not. At
length poor Tom, having neither bridle
nor saddle, slipped from his seat and
fell into a watering-pot, where he was
found almost drowned.</p>

<p>The queen vowed he should be guillotined;
but while the guillotine was getting
ready, he was secured once more in a
mousetrap. The cat, seeing something
stir and supposing it to be a mouse,
patted the trap about till she broke it
and set Tom at liberty.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a spider, taking him
for a fly, made at him. Tom drew his
sword and fought valiantly, but the
spider's poisonous breath overcame him:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"He fell dead on the ground where late he had stood,<br />
And the spider suck'd up the last drop of his blood."<br />
</div>

<p>King Thunstone and his whole court
went into mourning for little Tom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Thumb. They buried him under a
rosebush and raised a nice white marble
monument over his grave, with the
following epitaph:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Here lies Tom Thumb, King Arthur's knight,<br />
Who died by a spider's cruel bite.<br />
He was well known in Arthur's court,<br />
Where he afforded gallant sport;<br />
He rode at tilt and tournament,<br />
And on a mouse a-hunting went.<br />
Alive he fill'd the court with mirth,<br />

<div class="hang1">This chapbook form of the famous "Whittington
and His Cat" is the one reprinted by
Hartland in his <i>English Fairy and Folk
Tales</i>. It goes back to the early eighteenth
century. Sir Richard Whittington, at
least, was a historical character and served
his first term as Lord Mayor of London in
1397. Like most popular stories, this one
of a fortune due to a cat is common to all
Europe. Mr. Clouston, in the second
volume of his <i>Popular Tales and Fictions</i>,
outlines a number of these stories, and even
points out a Persian parallel of an earlier
date than the birth of Sir Richard. Just
how this very prosperous business man of
London, who was never in reality a poor
boy, came to be adopted as the hero of the
English version of this romantic tale has
never been made clear. Probably it was
due to the common tendency of the folk in
all lands to attribute unusual success in any
field to other than ordinary causes. However
that may be, it is certainly true that
no story more completely satisfies the ideal
of complete success for children than this
"History of Sir Richard Whittington."
Mr. Jacobs calls attention to the interesting
fact that the chapbook places the introduction
of the potato into England rather far
back!</div>


<h4><br />WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT</h4>

<p>In the reign of the famous King
Edward III, there was a little boy called
Dick Whittington, whose father and
mother died when he was very young, so
that he remembered nothing at all about
them and was left a ragged little fellow,
running about a country village. As
poor Dick was not old enough to work,
he was very badly off; he got but little
for his dinner and sometimes nothing at
all for his breakfast, for the people who
lived in the village were very poor indeed
and could not spare him much more than
the parings of potatoes and now and then
a hard crust of bread.</p>

<p>For all this, Dick Whittington was a
very sharp boy and was always listening
to what everybody talked about. On
Sunday he was sure to get near the
farmers as they sat talking on the tombstones
in the churchyard before the parson
was come; and once a week you
might see little Dick leaning against the
sign post of the village alehouse, where
people stopped to drink as they came
from the next market town; and when
the barber's shop door was open, Dick
listened to all the news that his customers
told one another.</p>

<p>In this manner Dick heard a great
many very strange things about the city
called London; for the foolish country
people at that time thought that folks
in London were all fine gentlemen and
ladies, and that there was singing and
music there all day long, and that the
streets were all paved with gold.</p>

<p>One day a large wagon and eight horses,
all with bells at their heads, drove
through the village while Dick was standing
by the signpost. He thought that
this wagon must be going to the fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
town of London; so he took courage and
asked the wagoner to let him walk with
him by the side of the wagon. As soon
as the wagoner heard that poor Dick
had no father or mother and saw by his
ragged clothes that he could not be worse
off than he was, he told him he might go
if he would, so they set off together.</p>

<p>I could never find out how little Dick
contrived to get meat and drink on the
road, nor how he could walk so far, for
it was a long way, nor what he did at
night for a place to lie down to sleep in.
Perhaps some good-natured people in the
towns that he passed through, when they
saw he was a poor little ragged boy, gave
him something to eat; and perhaps the
wagoner let him get into the wagon at
night and take a nap upon one of the
boxes or large parcels in the wagon.</p>

<p>Dick, however, got safe to London and
was in such a hurry to see the fine streets
paved all over with gold that I am afraid
he did not even stay to thank the kind
wagoner, but ran off as fast as his legs
would carry him through many of the
streets, thinking every moment to come
to those that were paved with gold, for
Dick had seen a guinea three times in his
own little village and remembered what
a deal of money it brought in change; so
he thought he had nothing to do but to
take up some little bits of the pavement
and should then have as much money as
he could wish for.</p>

<p>Poor Dick ran till he was tired and had
quite forgotten his friend the wagoner;
but at last, finding it grow dark and that
every way he turned he saw nothing but
dirt instead of gold, he sat down in a dark
corner and cried himself to sleep.</p>

<p>Little Dick was all night in the streets;
and next morning, being very hungry, he
got up and walked about and asked everybody
he met to give him a halfpenny to
keep him from starving. But nobody
stayed to answer him, and only two or
three gave him a halfpenny; so that the
poor boy was soon quite weak and faint
for the want of victuals.</p>

<p>At last a good-natured looking gentleman
saw how hungry he looked. "Why
don't you go to work, my lad?" said he
to Dick.</p>

<p>"That I would, but I do not know how
to get any," answered Dick.</p>

<p>"If you are willing, come along with
me," said the gentleman, and took him
to a hay-field, where Dick worked briskly
and lived merrily till the hay was made.</p>

<p>After this he found himself as badly off
as before; and being almost starved again,
he laid himself down at the door of Mr.
Fitzwarren, a rich merchant. Here he
was soon seen by the cook-maid, who was
an ill-tempered creature and happened
just then to be very busy dressing dinner
for her master and mistress; so she called
out to poor Dick: "What business
have you there, you lazy rogue? There is
nothing else but beggars. If you do not
take yourself away, we will see how you
will like a sousing of some dish water; I
have some here hot enough to make you
jump."</p>

<p>Just at that time Mr. Fitzwarren himself
came home to dinner; and when he
saw a dirty ragged boy lying at the door,
he said to him: "Why do you lie there,
my boy? You seem old enough to work.
I am afraid you are inclined to be lazy."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, sir," said Dick to him,
"that is not the case, for I would work
with all my heart, but I do not know
anybody, and I believe I am very sick
for the want of food."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow, get up; let me see what
ails you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick then tried to rise, but was obliged
to lie down again, being too weak to
stand, for he had not eaten any food for
three days and was no longer able to
run about and beg a halfpenny of people
in the street. So the kind merchant
ordered him to be taken into the house,
and have a good dinner given him, and
be kept to do what dirty work he was
able for the cook.</p>

<p>Little Dick would have lived very
happy in this good family if it had not
been for the ill-natured cook, who was
finding fault and scolding him from
morning to night, and besides she was so
fond of basting that when she had no
meat to baste she would baste poor
Dick's head and shoulders with a broom
or anything else that happened to fall in
her way. At last her ill-usage of him
was told to Alice, Mr. Fitzwarren's
daughter, who told the cook she should
be turned away if she did not treat him
kinder.</p>

<p>The ill-humor of the cook was now a
little amended; but besides this Dick had
another hardship to get over. His bed
stood in a garret where there were so
many holes in the floor and the walls
that every night he was tormented with
rats and mice. A gentleman having
given Dick a penny for cleaning his shoes,
he thought he would buy a cat with it.
The next day he saw a girl with a cat
and asked her if she would let him have
it for a penny. The girl said she would
and at the same time told him the cat
was an excellent mouser.</p>

<p>Dick hid his cat in the garret and
always took care to carry a part of his
dinner to her, and in a short time he had
no more trouble with the rats and mice,
but slept quite sound every night.</p>

<p>Soon after this his master had a ship
ready to sail; and as he thought it right
that all his servants should have some
chance for good fortune as well as himself,
he called them all into the parlor
and asked them what they would send out.</p>

<p>They all had something that they were
willing to venture except poor Dick, who
had neither money nor goods, and therefore
could send nothing.</p>

<p>For this reason he did not come into
the parlor with the rest; but Miss Alice
guessed what was the matter and ordered
him to be called in. She then said she
would lay down some money for him
from her own purse; but the father told
her this would not do, for it must be something
of his own.</p>

<p>When poor Dick heard this, he said he
had nothing but a cat which he bought
for a penny some time since of a little
girl.</p>

<p>"Fetch your cat then, my good boy,"
said Mr. Fitzwarren, "and let her go."</p>

<p>Dick went up stairs and brought down
poor puss, with tears in his eyes, and
gave her to the captain, for he said he
should now be kept awake again all night
by the rats and mice.</p>

<p>All the company laughed at Dick's odd
venture; and Miss Alice, who felt pity for
the poor boy, gave him some money to
buy another cat.</p>

<p>This and many other marks of kindness
shown him by Miss Alice made the ill-tempered
cook jealous of poor Dick, and
she began to use him more cruelly than
ever and always made game of him for
sending his cat to sea. She asked him
if he thought his cat would sell for as
much money as would buy a stick to beat
him.</p>

<p>At last poor Dick could not bear this
usage any longer, and he thought he
would run away from his place; so he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
packed up his few things and started very
early in the morning on All-hallows Day,
which is the first of November. He
walked as far as Holloway, and there sat
down on a stone, which to this day is
called Whittington's stone, and began
to think to himself which road he should
take as he proceeded.</p>

<p>While he was thinking what he should
do, the Bells of Bow Church, which at
that time had only six, began to ring,
and he fancied their sound seemed to say
to him:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Turn again, Whittington,<br />
Lord Mayor of London."<br />
</div>

<p>"Lord Mayor of London!" said he to
himself. "Why, to be sure, I would put
up with almost anything now to be Lord
Mayor of London and ride in a fine
coach when I grow to be a man! Well,
I will go back and think nothing of the
cuffing and scolding of the old cook if I
am to be Lord Mayor of London at last."</p>

<p>Dick went back and was lucky enough
to get into the house and set about his
work before the old cook came downstairs.</p>

<p>The ship, with the cat on board, was a
long time at sea, and was at last driven
by the winds on a part of the coast of
Barbary where the only people were the
Moors, whom the English had never
known before.</p>

<p>The people then came in great numbers
to see the sailors, who were of different
color from themselves, and treated them
very civilly, and when they became better
acquainted were very eager to buy the
fine things that the ship was loaded
with.</p>

<p>When the captain saw this, he sent
patterns of the best things he had to the
king of the country, who was so much
pleased with them that he sent for the
captain to the palace. Here they were
placed, as it is the custom of the country,
on rich carpets marked with gold and
silver flowers. The king and queen
were seated at the upper end of the room,
and a number of dishes were brought in
for dinner. When they had sat but a
short time, a vast number of rats and
mice rushed in, helping themselves from
almost every dish. The captain wondered
at this and asked if these vermin
were not very unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said they, "very offensive;
and the king would give half his treasure
to be freed of them, for they not only
destroy his dinner, as you see, but they
assault him in his chamber and even in
bed, so that he is obliged to be watched
while he is sleeping for fear of them."</p>

<p>The captain jumped for joy; he remembered
poor Whittington and his cat and
told the king he had a creature on board
the ship that would dispatch all these
vermin immediately. The king's heart
heaved so high at the joy which this news
gave him that his turban dropped off his
head. "Bring this creature to me,"
says he; "vermin are dreadful in a court,
and if she will perform what you say, I
will load your ship with gold and jewels
in exchange for her."</p>

<p>The captain, who knew his business,
took this opportunity to set forth the
merits of Mrs. Puss. He told his majesty
that it would be inconvenient to part
with her, as, when she was gone, the rats
and mice might destroy the goods in the
ship&mdash;but to oblige his majesty he
would fetch her. "Run, run!" said the
queen; "I am impatient to see the dear
creature."</p>

<p>Away went the captain to the ship,
while another dinner was got ready. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
put puss under his arm and arrived at
the palace soon enough to see the table
full of rats.</p>

<p>When the cat saw them, she did not
wait for bidding, but jumped out of the
captain's arms and in a few minutes laid
almost all the rats and mice dead at her
feet. The rest of them in their fright
scampered away to their holes.</p>

<p>The king and queen were quite charmed
to get so easily rid of such plagues and
desired that the creature who had done
them so great a kindness might be
brought to them for inspection. The
captain called, "Pussy, pussy, pussy!"
and she came to him. He then presented
her to the queen, who started back and
was afraid to touch a creature who had
made such a havoc among the rats and
mice. However, when the captain stroked
the cat and called, "Pussy, pussy," the
queen also touched her and cried, "Putty,
putty," for she had not learned English.
He then put her down on the queen's lap;
where she, purring, played with her majesty's
hand and then sang herself to sleep.</p>

<p>The king, having seen the exploits of
Mrs. Puss and being informed that she
was with young and would stock the whole
country, bargained with the captain for
the whole ship's cargo and then gave
him ten times as much for the cat as
all the rest amounted to.</p>

<p>The captain then took leave of the
royal party and set sail with a fair wind
for England, and after a happy voyage
arrived safe in London.</p>

<p>One morning when Mr. Fitzwarren had
just come to his counting-house and
seated himself at the desk, somebody
came tap, tap, at the door. "Who's
there?" says Mr. Fitzwarren.</p>

<p>"A friend," answered the other; "I
come to bring you good news of your
ship <i>Unicorn</i>." The merchant, bustling
up instantly, opened the door, and who
should be seen waiting but the captain
with a cabinet of jewels and a bill of
lading, for which the merchant lifted up
his eyes and thanked heaven for sending
him such a prosperous voyage.</p>

<p>They then told the story of the cat
and showed the rich present that the
king and queen had sent for her to poor
Dick. As soon as the merchant heard
this, he called out to his servants:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Go fetch him&mdash;we will tell him of the same;<br />
Pray call him Mr. Whittington by name."<br />
</div>

<p>Mr. Fitzwarren now showed himself
to be a good man; for when some of
his servants said so great a treasure was
too much for him, he answered, "God
forbid I should deprive him of the value
of a single penny."</p>

<p>He then sent for Dick, who at that
time was scouring pots for the cook and
was quite dirty.</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzwarren ordered a chair to be
set for him, and so he began to think
they were making game of him, at the
same time begging them not to play
tricks with a poor simple boy, but to
let him go down again, if they pleased,
to his work.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Whittington," said the
merchant, "we are all quite in earnest
with you, and I most heartily rejoice in
the news these gentlemen have brought
you, for the captain has sold your cat
to the King of Barbary and brought you
in return for her more riches than I
possess in the whole world; and I wish
you may long enjoy them!"</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzwarren then told the men to
open the great treasure they had brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
with them, and said, "Mr. Whittington
has nothing to do but to put it in some
place of safety."</p>

<p>Poor Dick hardly knew how to behave
himself for joy. He begged his master
to take what part of it he pleased, since
he owed it all to his kindness. "No, no,"
answered Mr. Fitzwarren, "this is all
your own, and I have no doubt but you
will use it well."</p>

<p>Dick next asked his mistress, and then
Miss Alice, to accept a part of his good
fortune; but they would not, and at the
same time told him they felt great joy
at his good success. But this poor fellow
was too kind-hearted to keep it all
to himself; so he made a present to the
captain, the mate, and the rest of Mr.
Fitzwarren's servants, and even to the
ill-natured old cook.</p>

<p>After this Mr. Fitzwarren advised him
to send for a proper tradesman and get
himself dressed like a gentleman, and
told him he was welcome to live in his
house till he could provide himself with
a better.</p>

<p>When Whittington's face was washed,
his hair curled, and his hat cocked, and
he was dressed in a nice suit of clothes,
he was as handsome and genteel as any
young man who visited at Mr. Fitzwarren's;
so that Miss Alice, who had
once been so kind to him and thought
of him with pity, now looked upon him
as fit to be her sweetheart; and the
more so, no doubt, because Whittington
was now always thinking what he could
do to oblige her and making her the
prettiest presents that could be.</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzwarren soon saw their love
for each other and proposed to join them
in marriage, and to this they both readily
agreed. A day for the wedding was soon
fixed; and they were attended to church
by the Lord Mayor, the court of aldermen,
the sheriffs, and a great number of
the richest merchants in London, whom
they afterwards treated with a very rich
feast.</p>

<p>History tells us that Mr. Whittington
and his lady lived in great splendor and
were very happy. They had several
children. He was Sheriff of London,
also Mayor, and received the honor of
knighthood by Henry V.</p>

<p>The figure of Sir Richard Whittington
with his cat in his arms, carved in stone,
was to be seen till the year 1780 over
the archway of the old prison of Newgate
that stood across Newgate Street.</p>

<div class="hang1">The next story came from Suffolk, England,
and the original is in the pronounced dialect
of that county. Mr. Jacobs thinks it one
of the best folk tales ever collected. The
version given follows Jacobs in reducing the
dialect. There is enough left, however,
to raise the question of the use of dialect
in stories for children. Some modern versions
eliminate the dialect altogether. It
is certain that the retention of some of the
qualities of the folk-telling makes it more
dramatically effective and appropriate.
The original form of the story may be seen
in Hartland's <i>English Fairy and Folk Tales</i>.
Teachers should feel free to use their judgment
as to the best form in which to tell
a story to children. Name-guessing stories
are very common, and may be "a 'survival'
of the superstition that to know a
man's name gives you power over him,
for which reason savages object to tell their
names." The Grimm story of "Rumpelstiltskin"
is the best known of many variants
(No. <a href="#Note_178">178</a>). "Tom Tit Tot" has a
rude vigor and dramatic force not in the
continental versions, and it will be interesting
to compare it with the Grimm tale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Jacobs suggests that "it may be necessary
to explain to the little ones that Tom Tit
can be referred to only as 'that,' because
his name is not known until the end."</div>


<h4><br />TOM TIT TOT</h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was a woman,
and she baked five pies. And when they
came out of the oven, they were that over-baked
the crusts were too hard to eat.
So she says to her daughter: "Darter,"
says she, "put you them there pies on
the shelf, and leave 'em there a little,
and they'll come again."&mdash;She meant,
you know, the crust would get soft.</p>

<p>But the girl, she says to herself, "Well,
if they'll come again, I'll eat 'em now."
And she set to work and ate 'em all,
first and last.</p>

<p>Well, come supper-time the woman
said, "Go you and get one o' them there
pies. I dare say they've come again
now."</p>

<p>The girl went and she looked, and there
was nothing but the dishes. So back
she came and says she, "Noo, they ain't
come again."</p>

<p>"Not one of 'em?" says the mother.</p>

<p>"Not one of 'em," says she.</p>

<p>"Well, come again or not come again,"
said the woman, "I'll have one for
supper."</p>

<p>"But you can't if they ain't come,"
said the girl.</p>

<p>"But I can," says she. "Go you and
bring the best of 'em."</p>

<p>"Best or worst," says the girl, "I've
ate 'em all, and you can't have one till
that's come again."</p>

<p>Well, the woman she was done, and
she took her spinning to the door to
spin, and as she span she sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"My darter ha' ate five, five pies to-day.<br />
My darter ha' ate five, five pies to-day."<br />
</div>

<p>The king was coming down the street,
and he heard her sing, but what she sang
he couldn't hear, so he stopped and said,
"What was that you were singing, my
good woman?"</p>

<p>The woman was ashamed to let him
hear what her daughter had been doing,
so she sang, instead of that:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"My darter ha' spun five, five skeins to-day.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My darter ha' spun five, five skeins to-day."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Stars o' mine!" said the king, "I
never heard tell of any one that could
do that."</p>

<p>Then he said, "Look you here, I want
a wife, and I'll marry your daughter.
But look you here," says he, "eleven
months out of the year she shall have
all she likes to eat, and all the gowns she
likes to get, and all the company she
likes to keep; but the last month of
the year she'll have to spin five skeins
every day, and if she don't I shall kill
her."</p>

<p>"All right," says the woman; for she
thought what a grand marriage that was.
And as for the five skeins, when the time
came, there'd be plenty of ways of getting
out of it, and likeliest, he'd have
forgotten all about it.</p>

<p>Well, so they were married. And for
eleven months the girl had all she liked
to eat and all the gowns she liked to get
and all the company she liked to keep.</p>

<p>But when the time was getting over,
she began to think about the skeins and
to wonder if he had 'em in mind. But
not one word did he say about 'em, and
she thought he'd wholly forgotten 'em.</p>

<p>However, the first day of the last month
he takes her to a room she'd never set
eyes on before. There was nothing in
it but a spinning-wheel and a stool.
And says he, "Now, my dear, here you'll
be shut in to-morrow with some victuals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and some flax, and if you haven't spun
five skeins by the night, your head'll
go off." And away he went about his
business.</p>

<p>Well, she was that frightened, she'd
always been such a gatless girl, that she
didn't so much as know how to spin,
and what was she to do to-morrow with
no one to come nigh her to help her?
She sat down on a stool in the kitchen,
and law! how she did cry!</p>

<p>However, all of a sudden she heard a
sort of a knocking low down on the door.
She upped and oped it, and what should
she see but a small little black thing with
a long tail. That looked up at her right
curious, and that said, "What are you
a-crying for?"</p>

<p>"What's that to you?" says she.</p>

<p>"Never you mind," that said, "but
tell me what you're a-crying for."</p>

<p>"That won't do me no good if I do,"
says she.</p>

<p>"You don't know that," that said, and
twirled that's tail round.</p>

<p>"Well," says she, "that won't do no
harm, if that don't do no good," and she
upped and told about the pies and the
skeins and everything.</p>

<p>"This is what I'll do," says the little
black thing, "I'll come to your window
every morning and take the flax and bring
it spun at night."</p>

<p>"What's your pay?" says she.</p>

<p>That looked out of the corner of that's
eyes, and that said, "I'll give you three
guesses every night to guess my name,
and if you haven't guessed it before the
month's up you shalt be mine."</p>

<p>Well, she thought she'd be sure to guess
that's name before the month was up.
"All right," says she, "I agree."</p>

<p>"All right," that says, and law! how
that twirled that's tail.</p>

<p>Well, the next day her husband took
her into the room, and there was the
flax and the day's food.</p>

<p>"Now, there's the flax," says he, "and
if that ain't spun up this night, off goes
your head." And then he went out and
locked the door.</p>

<p>He'd hardly gone when there was
a knocking against the window. She
upped and she oped it, and there sure
enough was the little old thing sitting
on the ledge.</p>

<p>"Where's the flax?" says he.</p>

<p>"Here it be," says she. And she gave
it to him.</p>

<p>Well, come the evening a knocking came
again to the window. She upped and she
oped it, and there was the little old thing
with five skeins of flax on his arm.</p>

<p>"Here it be," says he, and he gave it
to her. "Now, what's my name?" says
he. "What, is that Bill?" says she.
"Noo, that ain't," says he, and he
twirled his tail. "Is that Ned?" says
she. "Noo, that ain't," says he, and he
twirled his tail. "Well, is that Mark?"
says she. "Noo, that ain't," says he,
and he twirled his tail harder, and away
he flew.</p>

<p>Well, when her husband came in, there
were the five skeins ready for him. "I
see I shan't have to kill you to-night,
my dear," says he; "you'll have your
food and your flax in the morning," says
he, and away he goes.</p>

<p>Well, every day the flax and the food
were brought, and every day that there
little black impet used to come mornings
and evenings. And all the day the girl
sat trying to think of names to say to it
when it came at night. But she never
hit on the right one. And as it got
towards the end of the month, the impet
began to look so maliceful, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
twirled that's tail faster and faster each
time she gave a guess.</p>

<p>At last it came to the last day but one.
The impet came at night along with the
five skeins, and that said, "What, ain't
you got my name yet?" "Is that Nicodemus?"
says she. "Noo, 't ain't,"
that says. "Is that Sammle?" says she.
"Noo, 't ain't," that says. "A-well, is
that Methusalem?" says she. "Noo,
't ain't that neither," that says.</p>

<p>Then that looks at her with that's
eyes like a coal o' fire, and that says,
"Woman, there's only to-morrow night,
and then you'll be mine!" And away
it flew.</p>

<p>Well, she felt that horrid. However
she heard the king coming along the
passage. In he came, and when he sees
the five skeins, says he, "Well, my dear,
I don't see but what you'll have your
skeins ready to-morrow night as well
and as I reckon I shan't have to kill you,
I'll have supper in here to-night." So
they brought supper and another stool
for him, and down the two sat.</p>

<p>Well, he hadn't eaten but a mouthful
or so, when he stops and begins to laugh.</p>

<p>"What is it?" says she.</p>

<p>"A-why," says he, "I was out a-hunting
to-day, and I got away to a place
in the wood I'd never seen before. And
there was an old chalk-pit. And I heard
a kind of a sort of humming. So I got
off my hobby, and I went right quiet to
the pit, and I looked down. Well, what
should there be but the funniest little
black thing you ever set eyes on. And
what was that doing, but that had a
little spinning-wheel, and that was spinning
wonderful fast, and twirling that's
tail. And as that span that sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Nimmy nimmy not<br />
My name's Tom Tit Tot."<br />
</div>

<p>Well, when the girl heard this, she
felt as if she could have jumped out of
her skin for joy, but she didn't say a
word.</p>

<p>Next day that there little thing looked
so maliceful when he came for the flax.
And when night came she heard that
knocking against the window panes.
She oped the window, and that come
right in on the ledge. That was grinning
from ear to ear, and Oo! that's tail was
twirling round so fast.</p>

<p>"What's my name?" that says, as
that gave her the skeins. "Is that
Solomon?" she says, pretending to be
afeard. "Noo, 't ain't," that says, and
that came further into the room. "Well,
is that Zebedee?" says she again. "Noo,
't ain't," says the impet. And then that
laughed and twirled that's tail till you
couldn't hardly see it.</p>

<p>"Take time, woman," that says;
"next guess, and you're mine." And
that stretched out that's black hands at
her.</p>

<p>Well, she backed a step or two, and she
looked at it, and then she laughed out
and says she, pointing her finger at it:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Nimmy nimmy not<br />
Your name's Tom Tit Tot."<br />
</div>

<p>Well, when that heard her, that gave
an awful shriek and away that flew into
the dark, and she never saw it any more.</p>

<div class="hang1">In 1697 the French author Charles Perrault
(1628-1703) published a little collection of
eight tales in prose familiarly known as
<i>The Tales of Mother Goose</i> (<i>Contes de Ma
M&egrave;re l'Oye</i>). These tales were "The
Fairies" ("Toads and Diamonds"), "The
Sleeping Beauty in the Wood," "Bluebeard,"
"Little Red Riding Hood," "Puss-in-Boots,"
"Cinderella," "Rique with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Tuft," and "Little Thumb." Perrault was
prominent as a scholar and may have felt
it beneath his dignity to write nursery
tales. At any rate he declared the stories
were copied from tellings by his eleven-year-old
son. But Perrault's fairies have
not only saved him from oblivion: in countless
editions and translations they have
won him immortality. The charming literary
form of his versions, "Englished by
R. S., Gent," about 1730, soon established
them in place of the more somber English
popular versions. It is practically certain
that the name Mother Goose, as that of the
genial old lady who presides over the light
literature of the nursery, was established
by the work of Perrault.<br />
<br />
"Little Red Riding Hood," a likely candidate
for first place in the affections of childish
story-lovers, is here given in its "correct"
form. Many versions are so constructed
as to have happy endings, either by having
the woodmen appear in the nick of time to
kill the wolf before any damage is done, or
by having the grandmother and Little Red
Riding Hood restored to life after recovering
them from the "innards" of the wolf.
Andrew Lang thinks that the tale as it
stands is merely meant to waken a child's
terror and pity, after the fashion of the old
Greek tragedies, and that the narrator
properly ends it by making a pounce, in
the character of wolf, at the little listener.
That this was the correct "business" in
Scotch nurseries is borne out by a sentence
in Chambers' <i>Popular Rhymes of Scotland:</i>
"The old nurse's imitation of the <i>gnash,
gnash</i>, which she played off upon the youngest
urchin lying in her lap, was electric."</div>


<h4><br />LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD</h4>

<p>Once upon a time there lived in a certain
village a little country girl, the
prettiest creature that was ever seen.
Her mother was excessively fond of her;
and her grandmother doted on her still
more. This good woman got made for
her a little red riding-hood, which became
the girl so extremely well that everybody
called her Little Red Riding-Hood.</p>

<p>One day her mother, having made
some custards, said to her, "Go, my
dear, and see how thy grandmamma
does, for I hear that she has been very
ill; carry her a custard and this little
pot of butter."</p>

<p>Little Red Riding-Hood set out immediately
to go to her grandmother, who
lived in another village.</p>

<p>As she was going through the wood,
she met with Gaffer Wolf, who had a
very great mind to eat her up, but he
durst not because of some fagot-makers
hard by in the forest. He asked her
whither she was going. The poor child,
who did not know that it was dangerous
to stay and hear a wolf talk, said to him,
"I am going to see my grandmamma and
carry her a custard and a little pot of
butter from my mamma."</p>

<p>"Does she live far off?" said the wolf.</p>

<p>"Oh! aye," answered Little Red
Riding-Hood, "it is beyond the mill
you see there at the first house in the
village."</p>

<p>"Well," said the wolf, "and I'll go
and see her too. I'll go this way and
you go that, and we shall see who will be
there soonest."</p>

<p>The wolf began to run as fast as he
could, taking the nearest way, and the
little girl went by that farthest about,
diverting herself by gathering nuts, running
after butterflies, and making nosegays
of such little flowers as she met with.
The wolf was not long before he got to
the old woman's house. He knocked at
the door&mdash;tap, tap.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood,"
replied the wolf, counterfeiting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
her voice, "who has brought you a
custard and a pot of butter sent you
by mamma."</p>

<p>The good grandmother, who was in
bed because she was somewhat ill, cried
out, "Pull the bobbin and the latch will
go up."</p>

<p>The wolf pulled the bobbin and the
door opened, and then presently he fell
upon the good woman and ate her up
in a moment, for it was above three days
that he had not touched a bit. He then
shut the door and went into the grandmother's
bed, expecting Little Red Riding-Hood,
who came some time afterward
and knocked at the door&mdash;tap, tap.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>Little Red Riding-Hood, hearing the
big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid,
but believing her grandmother had got
a cold and was hoarse, answered, "'Tis
your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood,
who has brought you a custard and a
little pot of butter mamma sends you."</p>

<p>The wolf cried out to her, softening
his voice as much as he could, "Pull the
bobbin and the latch will go up."</p>

<p>Little Red Riding-Hood pulled the
bobbin and the door opened.</p>

<p>The wolf, seeing her come in, said to
her, hiding himself under the bedclothes,
"Put the custard and the little pot of
butter upon the stool and come and lie
down with me."</p>

<p>Little Red Riding-Hood undressed herself
and went into bed, where, being
greatly amazed to see how her grandmother
looked in her night-clothes, she
said to her, "Grandmamma, what great
arms you have got!"</p>

<p>"That is the better to hug thee, my
dear."</p>

<p>"Grandmamma, what great legs you
have got!"</p>

<p>"That is to run the better, my child."</p>

<p>"Grandmamma, what great ears you
have got!"</p>

<p>"That is to hear the better, my child."</p>

<p>"Grandmamma, what great eyes you
have got!"</p>

<p>"It is to see the better, my child."</p>

<p>"Grandmamma, what great teeth you
have got!"</p>

<p>"That is to eat thee up."</p>

<p>And saying these words, this wicked
wolf fell upon Little Red Riding-Hood
and ate her all up.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_162" id="Note_162">162</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Because many modern teachers are distressed
at the tragedy of the real story of "Little
Red Riding Hood" as just given, they prefer
some softened form of the tale. The
Grimm version, "Little Red Cap," is generally
used by those who insist on a happy
ending. There Little Red Riding Hood and
her grandmother are both recovered and
the wicked wolf destroyed. The story that
follows is from a modern French author,
Charles Marelles, and is given in the translation
found in Lang's <i>Red Fairy Book</i>.
In it the events are dramatically imagined
in detail, even if the writer does turn it
all into a sunflower myth at the close.</div>


<h4><br />TRUE HISTORY OF LITTLE
GOLDEN HOOD</h4>

<p>You know the tale of poor Little Red
Riding-Hood, that the wolf deceived and
devoured, with her cake, her little butter
can, and her grandmother. Well, the
true story happened quite differently, as
we know now. And first of all, the
little girl was called and is still called
Little Golden Hood; secondly, it was
not she, nor the good granddame, but
the wicked wolf who was, in the end,
caught and devoured.</p>

<p>Only listen.</p>

<p>The story begins something like the tale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>There was once a little peasant girl,
pretty and nice as a star in its season.
Her real name was Blanchette, but she
was more often called Little Golden
Hood, on account of a wonderful little
cloak with a hood, gold and fire colored,
which she always had on. This little
hood was given her by her grandmother,
who was so old that she did not know
her age; it ought to bring her good
luck, for it was made of a ray of sunshine,
she said. And as the good old woman
was considered something of a witch,
every one thought the little hood rather
bewitched too.</p>

<p>And so it was, as you will see.</p>

<p>One day the mother said to the child:
"Let us see, my little Golden Hood, if
you know now how to find your way by
yourself. You shall take this good piece
of cake to your grandmother for a Sunday
treat to-morrow. You will ask her
how she is, and come back at once,
without stopping to chatter on the way
with people you don't know. Do you
quite understand?"</p>

<p>"I quite understand," replied Blanchette
gayly. And off she went with the
cake, quite proud of her errand.</p>

<p>But the grandmother lived in another
village, and there was a big wood to
cross before getting there. At a turn
of the road under the trees suddenly,
"Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"Friend Wolf."</p>

<p>He had seen the child start alone, and
the villain was waiting to devour her,
when at the same moment he perceived
some wood-cutters who might observe
him, and he changed his mind. Instead
of falling upon Blanchette he came frisking
up to her like a good dog.</p>

<p>"'Tis you! my nice Little Golden
Hood," said he. So the little girl stops
to talk with the wolf, whom, for all that,
she did not know in the least.</p>

<p>"You know me, then!" said she.
"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"My name is friend Wolf. And where
are you going thus, my pretty one, with
your little basket on your arm?"</p>

<p>"I am going to my grandmother to
take her a good piece of cake for her
Sunday treat to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And where does she live, your grandmother?"</p>

<p>"She lives at the other side of the wood
in the first house in the village, near the
windmill, you know."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes! I know now," said the
wolf. "Well, that's just where I'm
going. I shall get there before you, no
doubt, with your little bits of legs, and
I'll tell her you're coming to see her;
then she'll wait for you."</p>

<p>Thereupon the wolf cuts across the
wood, and in five minutes arrives at the
grandmother's house.</p>

<p>He knocks at the door: toc, toc.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>He knocks louder.</p>

<p>Nobody.</p>

<p>Then he stands up on end, puts his
two fore paws on the latch, and the door
opens.</p>

<p>Not a soul in the house.</p>

<p>The old woman had risen early to sell
herbs in the town, and had gone off in such
haste that she had left her bed unmade,
with her great night-cap on the pillow.</p>

<p>"Good!" said the wolf to himself, "I
know what I'll do."</p>

<p>He shuts the door, pulls on the grandmother's
night-cap down to his eyes;
then he lies down all his length in the
bed and draws the curtains.</p>

<p>In the meantime the good Blanchette
went quietly on her way, as little girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
do, amusing herself here and there by
picking Easter daisies, watching the
little birds making their nests, and running
after the butterflies which fluttered
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>At last she arrives at the door.</p>

<p>Knock, knock.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" says the wolf, softening
his rough voice as best he can.</p>

<p>"It's me, granny, your Little Golden
Hood. I'm bringing you a big piece of
cake for your Sunday treat to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Press your finger on the latch; then
push and the door opens."</p>

<p>"Why, you've got a cold, granny,"
said she, coming in.</p>

<p>"Ahem! a little, my dear, a little,"
replies the wolf, pretending to cough.
"Shut the door well, my little lamb.
Put your basket on the table, and then
take off your frock and come and lie
down by me; you shall rest a little."</p>

<p>The good child undresses, but observe
this:&mdash;she kept her little hood upon her
head. When she saw what a figure her
granny cut in bed, the poor little thing
was much surprised.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cries she, "how like you are to
friend Wolf, grandmother!"</p>

<p>"That's on account of my night-cap,
child," replies the wolf.</p>

<p>"Oh! what hairy arms you've got,
grandmother!"</p>

<p>"All the better to hug you, my child."</p>

<p>"Oh! what a big tongue you've got,
grandmother!"</p>

<p>"All the better for answering, child."</p>

<p>"Oh! what a mouthful of great white
teeth you have, grandmother!"</p>

<p>"That's for crunching little children
with!" And the wolf opened his jaws
wide to swallow Blanchette.</p>

<p>But she put down her head, crying,
"Mamma! mamma!" and the wolf only
caught her little hood.</p>

<p>Thereupon, oh, dear! oh, dear! he
draws back, crying and shaking his jaw
as if he had swallowed red-hot coals.</p>

<p>It was the little fire-colored hood that
had burnt his tongue right down his
throat.</p>

<p>The little hood, you see, was one of
those magic caps that they used to have
in former times, in the stories, for making
one's self invisible or invulnerable.</p>

<p>So there was the wolf with his throat
burned, jumping off the bed and trying
to find the door, howling and howling as
if all the dogs in the country were at his
heels.</p>

<p>Just at this moment the grandmother
arrives, returning from the town with
her long sack empty on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ah, brigand!" she cries, "wait a bit!"
Quickly she opens her sack wide across
the door, and the maddened wolf springs
in head downward.</p>

<p>It is he now that is caught, swallowed
like a letter in the post. For the brave
old dame shuts her sack, so; and she
runs and empties it in the well, where
the vagabond, still howling, tumbles in
and is drowned.</p>

<p>"Ah, scoundrel! you thought you
would crunch my little grandchild! Well,
to-morrow we will make her a muff of
your skin, and you yourself shall be
crunched, for we will give your carcass
to the dogs."</p>

<p>Thereupon the grandmother hastened
to dress poor Blanchette, who was still
trembling with fear in the bed.</p>

<p>"Well," she said to her, "without my
little hood where would you be now, darling?"
And, to restore heart and legs to
the child, she made her eat a good piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of her cake, and drink a good draught
of wine, after which she took her by
the hand and led her back to the house.</p>

<p>And then, who was it who scolded her
when she knew all that had happened?</p>

<p>It was the mother.</p>

<p>But Blanchette promised over and
over again that she would never more
stop to listen to a wolf, so that at last
the mother forgave her.</p>

<p>And Blanchette, the Little Golden
Hood, kept her word. And in fine
weather she may still be seen in the
fields with her pretty little hood, the
color of the sun.</p>

<p>But to see her you must rise early.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_163" id="Note_163">163</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The next Perrault story is given in the traditional
English form made by "R. S., Gent."
Perrault met the popular taste of his time
for "morals" by adding more or less playful
ones in verse to his stories. Here is a
prose rendering of a portion of the <i>Moralit&eacute;</i>
attached to "Puss-in-Boots": "However
great may be the advantage of enjoying a
rich inheritance coming down from father
to son, industry and ingenuity are worth
more to young people as a usual thing than
goods acquired without personal effort."
In relation to this moral, Ralston says,
"the conclusion at which an ordinary
reader would arrive, if he were not dazzled
by fairy-land glamor, would probably be
that far better than either tact and industry
on a master's part is the loyalty of an
unscrupulous retainer of an imaginative
turn of mind. The impropriety of this
teaching is not balanced by any other form
of instruction. What the story openly
inculcates is not edifying, and it does not
secretly convey any improving doctrine."
But on the other hand it may be argued
that the "moral" passes over the child's
head. Miss Kready, in her <i>Study of Fairy
Tales</i> (p. 275), makes a very elaborate and
proper defense of "Puss-in-Boots" as a
story for children. There is delight in its
strong sense of adventure, it has a hero
clever and quick, there is loyalty, love, and
sacrifice in Puss's devotion to his master,
the tricks are true to "cat-nature," there
are touches of nature beauty, a simple and
pleasing plot, while we should not forget
the delightful Ogre and his transformations
into Lion and Mouse. The story is found
in many forms among many different
peoples. Perhaps the great stroke of genius
which endears Perrault's version is in the
splendid boots with which his tale provides
the hero so that briers may not interfere
with his doings. (Extended studies of this
tale and its many parallels may be found in
Lang's <i>Perrault's Popular Tales;</i> in McCulloch's
<i>Childhood of Fiction</i>, chap. viii; in
an article by Ralston in the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i>, January, 1883, reprinted in <i>Living
Age</i>, Vol. CLVI, p. 362.)</div>


<h4><br />PUSS-IN-BOOTS</h4>

<p>There was once a miller who left no
more estate to the three sons he had than
his mill, his ass, and his cat. The partition
was soon made. Neither the clerk
nor the attorney was sent for. They
would soon have eaten up all the poor
patrimony. The eldest had the mill,
the second the ass, and the youngest
nothing but the cat.</p>

<p>The poor young fellow was quite comfortless
at having so poor a lot. "My
brothers," said he, "may get their living
handsomely enough by joining their
stocks together; but for my part, when
I have eaten up my cat and made me a
muff of his skin, I must die with hunger."</p>

<p>The cat, who heard all this, but made
as if he did not, said to him with a grave
and serious air; "Do not thus afflict
yourself, my good master; you have
nothing else to do but to give me a bag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and get a pair of boots made for me, that
I may scamper through the dirt and the
brambles, and you shall see that you have
not so bad a portion of me as you imagine."</p>

<p>Though the cat's master did not build
very much upon what he said, he had,
however, often seen him play a great
many cunning tricks to catch rats and
mice; as when he used to hang by the
heels, or hide himself in the meal and
make as if he were dead; so he did not
altogether despair of his affording him
some help in his miserable condition.</p>

<p>When the cat had what he asked for,
he booted himself very gallantly; and
putting his bag about his neck, he held
the strings of it in his two fore paws and
went into a warren where was a great
abundance of rabbits. He put bran and
sow-thistles into his bag, and, stretching
himself out at length as if he had been
dead, he waited for some young rabbits,
not yet acquainted with the deceits of
the world, to come and rummage his
bag for what he had just put into it.</p>

<p>Scarce was he lain down but he had
what he wanted. A rash and foolish
young rabbit jumped into his bag, and
master Puss, immediately drawing close
the strings, took and killed him without
pity. Proud of his prey, he went with it
to the palace and asked to speak with
his majesty. He was shown upstairs
into the king's apartment, and, making
a low reverence, said to him: "I have
brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren
which my noble lord, the Marquis of
Carabas" (for that was the title which
Puss was pleased to give his master), "has
commanded me to present to your
majesty from him."</p>

<p>"Tell thy master," said the king,
"that I thank him and that he gives me
a great deal of pleasure."</p>

<p>Another time he went and hid himself
among some standing corn, holding still
his bag open; and when a brace of partridges
ran into it, he drew the strings and
so caught them both. He went and made
a present of these to the king, as he had
done before of the rabbit which he took
in the warren. The king in like manner
received the partridges with great pleasure
and ordered him some money.</p>

<p>The cat continued for two or three
months thus to carry his majesty, from
time to time, game of his master's taking.
One day in particular, when he knew for
certain that he was to take the air along
the riverside with his daughter, the most
beautiful princess in the world, he said
to his master: "If you will follow my
advice, your fortune is made. You have
nothing else to do but go and wash yourself
in the river, in that part I shall show
you, and leave the rest to me." The
Marquis of Carabas did what the cat
advised him to, without knowing why or
wherefore.</p>

<p>While he was washing, the king passed
by, and the cat began to cry out as loud
as he could, "Help, help! my lord Marquis
of Carabas is going to be drowned." At
this noise the king put his head out of
his coach-window, and, finding it was the
cat who had so often brought him such
good game, he commanded his guards
to run immediately to the assistance of
his lordship, the Marquis of Carabas.</p>

<p>While they were drawing the poor marquis
out of the river, the cat came up to
the coach and told the king that while
his master was washing there came by
some rogues, who went off with his clothes
though he had cried out, "Thieves,
thieves," as loud as he could. This
cunning cat had hidden them under a
great stone. The king immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
commanded the officers of his wardrobe
to run and fetch one of his best suits for
the lord Marquis of Carabas.</p>

<p>The king caressed him after a very
extraordinary manner; and as the fine
clothes he had given him extremely set
off his good mien (for he was well made
and very handsome in his person), the
king's daughter took a secret inclination
to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had
no sooner cast two or three respectful
and somewhat tender glances, but she
fell in love with him to distraction. The
king would needs have him come into his
coach and take part of the airing. The
cat, quite overjoyed to see his project
begin to succeed, marched on before, and
meeting with some countrymen who were
mowing a meadow, he said to them,
"Good people, you who are mowing, if
you do not tell the king, who will soon
pass this way, that the meadow you
mow belongs to my lord Marquis of
Carabas, you shall be chopped as small
as herbs for the pot."</p>

<p>The king did not fail asking of the
mowers to whom the meadow they were
mowing belonged: "To my lord Marquis
of Carabas," answered they, all
together, for the cat's threats had made
them terribly afraid.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," said the marquis, "this
is a meadow which never fails to yield a
plentiful harvest every year."</p>

<p>The master-cat, who went still on
before, met with some reapers, and said
to them, "Good people, you who are
reaping, if you do not tell the king, who
will presently go by, that all this corn
belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you
shall be chopped as small as herbs for the
pot."</p>

<p>The king, who passed by a moment
after, would needs know to whom all
that corn, which he then saw, did belong.
"To my lord Marquis of Carabas,"
replied the reapers; and the king was
very well pleased with it, as well as the
marquis, whom he congratulated thereupon.
The master-cat, who went always
before, said the same words to all he
met; and the king was astonished at
the vast estates of my lord Marquis of
Carabas.</p>

<p>Master Puss came at last to a stately
castle, the owner of which was an ogre,
the richest that had ever been known,
for all the lands which the king had then
gone over belonged to this castle. The
cat, who had taken care to inform himself
who the ogre was and what he could
do, asked to speak with him, saying he
could not pass so near his castle without
having the honor of paying his respects
to him.</p>

<p>The ogre received him as civilly as an
ogre could do and made him sit down.
"I have been assured," said the cat,
"that you have the gift of being able to
change yourself into all sorts of creatures
you have a mind to. You can, for example,
transform yourself into a lion, or
elephant, and the like."</p>

<p>"This is true," answered the ogre very
briskly, "and to convince you, you shall
see me now become a lion."</p>

<p>Puss was so sadly terrified at the sight
of a lion so near him that he immediately
got into the gutter, not without abundance
of trouble and danger, because of
his boots, which were of no use at all to
him in walking upon the tiles. A little
while after, when Puss saw that the ogre
had resumed his natural form, he came
down and owned he had been very much
frightened.</p>

<p>"I have been, moreover, informed,"
said the cat, "but I know not how to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
believe it, that you have also the power
to take on you the shape of the smallest
animals; for example, to change yourself
into a rat or a mouse; but I must own to
you, I take this to be impossible."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried the ogre, "you
shall see that presently," and at the same
time changed himself into a mouse, and
began to run about the floor. Puss no
sooner perceived this but he fell upon
him and ate him up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the king, who saw, as he
passed, this fine castle of the ogre's, had
a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard
the noise of his majesty's coach running
over the drawbridge, ran out and said to
the king, "Your Majesty is welcome to
this castle of my lord Marquis of Carabas."</p>

<p>"What! my lord Marquis!" cried the
king, "and does this castle also belong
to you? There can be nothing finer
than this court and all the stately buildings
which surround it; let us go into
it, if you please." They passed into a
spacious hall, where they found a magnificent
collation which the ogre had
prepared for his friends, who were that
very day to visit him, but dared not to
enter, knowing the king was there. His
majesty was perfectly charmed with the
good qualities of my lord Marquis of
Carabas, as was his daughter, who had
fallen in love with him; and seeing the
vast estate he possessed, said to him
while they sat at the feast, "It will be
owing to yourself only, my lord Marquis,
if you are not my son-in-law." The
marquis, making several low bows,
accepted the honor which his majesty
conferred upon him, and forthwith, that
very same day, married the princess.</p>

<p>Puss became a great lord, and never
ran after mice any more, but only for
his diversion.</p>

<div class="hang1">Perrault attached to the next story this moral:
"Diamonds and dollars influence minds,
and yet gentle words have more effect and
are more to be esteemed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is a
lot of trouble to be upright and it requires
some effort, but sooner or later it finds its
reward, and generally when one is least
expecting it." English versions are usually
given the title "Toads and Diamonds,"
though Perrault's title was simply "The
Fairies" ("Les F&eacute;es"). Lang calls attention
to the fact that the origin of the story is
"manifestly moral." He thinks "it is an
obvious criticism that the elder girl should
have met the fairy first; she was not likely
to behave so rudely when she knew that
politeness would be rewarded." It would
be interesting for a story-teller to test the
effect of relating the incidents in the order
suggested by Lang.</div>


<h4><br />TOADS AND DIAMONDS</h4>

<p>There was once upon a time a widow
who had two daughters. The oldest was
so much like her in face and humor that
whoever looked upon the daughter saw
the mother. They were both so disagreeable
and so proud that there was
no living with them. The youngest, who
was the very picture of her father for
courtesy and sweetness of temper, was
withal one of the most beautiful girls
that was ever seen. As people naturally
love their own likenesses, this mother
ever doted on her eldest daughter and
at the same time had a sad aversion for
the youngest. She made her eat in the
kitchen and work continually.</p>

<p>Among other things, this poor child
was forced twice a day to draw water
above a mile and a half from the house,
and bring home a pitcher full of it. One
day as she was at this fountain there
came to her a poor woman, who begged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of her to let her drink. "Oh, yes, with all
my heart, Goody," said this pretty little
girl; and rinsing the pitcher, she took
up some water from the clearest place of
the fountain and gave it to her, holding
up the pitcher all the while that she might
drink the easier.</p>

<p>The good woman having drunk, said
to her, "You are so very pretty, my dear,
so good and so mannerly, that I cannot
help giving you a gift"&mdash;for this was a
fairy, who had taken the form of a poor
country woman to see how far the civility
and good manners of this pretty girl
would go. "I will give you for gift,"
continued the fairy, "that at every word
you speak, there shall come out of your
mouth either a flower or a jewel."</p>

<p>When this pretty girl came home, her
mother scolded at her for staying so long
at the fountain. "I beg your pardon,
mamma," said the poor girl, "for not making
more haste"; and, in speaking these
words, there came out of her mouth two
roses, two pearls, and two large diamonds.</p>

<p>"What is it I see there?" said her
mother quite astonished. "I think I see
pearls and diamonds come out of the
girl's mouth! How happens this, my
child?"&mdash;This was the first time she
ever called her her child.</p>

<p>The poor creature told her frankly all
the matter, not without dropping out
infinite numbers of diamonds. "In good
faith," cried the mother, "I must send
my child thither. Come hither, Fanny.
Look what comes out of your sister's
mouth when she speaks! Would you not
be glad, my dear, to have the same gift
given to you? You have nothing else
to do but go draw water out of the fountain,
and when a certain poor woman
asks you to let her drink, to give it her
very civilly."</p>

<p>"It would be a very fine sight, indeed,"
said this ill-bred minx, "to see me go
draw water!"</p>

<p>"You shall go, hussy," said the mother,
"and this minute." So away she went,
but grumbling all the way and taking
with her the best silver tankard in the
house.</p>

<p>She was no sooner at the fountain than
she saw coming out of the wood a lady
most gloriously dressed, who came up
to her and asked to drink. This was,
you must know, the very fairy who
appeared to her sister, but who had now
taken the air and dress of a princess to
see how far this girl's rudeness would go.
"Am I come hither," said the proud,
saucy maid, "to serve you with water,
pray? I suppose the silver tankard was
brought purely for your ladyship, was
it? However, you may drink out of it,
if you have a fancy."</p>

<p>"You are not over and above mannerly,"
answered the fairy, without putting
herself in a passion. "Well, then,
since you have so little breeding and are
so disobliging, I give you for gift, that at
every word you speak there shall come
out of your mouth a snake or a toad."</p>

<p>So soon as her mother saw her coming,
she cried out, "Well, daughter."</p>

<p>"Well, mother," answered the pert
hussy, throwing out of her mouth two
vipers and two toads.</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy!" cried the mother, "what
is it I see? Oh, it is that wretch, her sister,
who has occasioned all this; but she
shall pay for it"; and immediately she
ran to beat her. The poor child fled
away from her and went to hide herself
in the forest, not far from thence.</p>

<p>The king's son, then on his return from
hunting, met her, and seeing her so very
pretty, asked her what she did there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
alone, and why she cried. "Alas, sir!
my mamma has turned me out of doors."
The king's son, who saw five or six pearls,
and as many diamonds, come out of her
mouth, desired her to tell him how that
happened. She thereupon told him the
whole story; and so the king's son fell
in love with her; and, considering with
himself that such a gift was worth more
than any marriage-portion whatsoever
in another, he conducted her to the
palace of the king his father and there
married her.</p>

<p>As for her sister, she made herself so
much hated that her own mother turned
her off; and the miserable girl, having
wandered about a good while without
finding anybody to take her in, went to
a corner in the wood and there died.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_165" id="Note_165">165</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">"Cinderella" is one of the world's greatest
romantic stories. Its theme is a favorite
in all folk literature. Young and old alike
have never tired of hearing of the victories
won by the deserving in the face of all sorts
of obstacles. Perrault in his verse moral
observes that "while beauty is a rare
treasure for a woman, yet a winning manner,
or personality, is worth even more."
Still further, as if conscious of the part
influence plays in the world, he says that
"while it is doubtless a great advantage to
have wit and courage, breeding and good
sense, and other such natural endowments,
still they will be of no earthly use for our
advancement unless we have, to bring them
into play, either godfathers or godmothers."
One should not, however, take too seriously
any moralizing over a fairy story
whether by Perrault or another.<br />
<br />
In one of the most thorough studies of a single
folk tale, Miss Roalfe Cox's <i>Cinderella</i>,
with an introduction by Andrew Lang,
some three hundred and fifty variants of
the story have been analyzed. The thing
that marks a Cinderella story is the presence
in it of the "slipper test." The finest versions
are those by Perrault and the Grimms,
and they are almost equally favorites with
children. The Perrault form as found in
the old English translation is given here
for reasons stated by Ralston in his study
of the Cinderella type: "But Perrault's
rendering of the tale naturalised it in the
polite world, gave it for cultured circles an
attraction which it is never likely to lose.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It is with human more than with
mythological interest that the story is
replete, and therefore it appeals to human
hearts with a force which no lapse of time
can diminish. Such supernatural machinery
as is introduced, moreover, has a charm
for children which older versions of the
tale do not possess. The pumpkin carriage,
the rat coachman, the lizard lacqueys, and
all the other properties of the transformation
scene, appeal at once to the imagination
and the sense of humor of every
beholder." (<i>Nineteenth Century</i>, November,
1879.)</div>


<h4><br />CINDERELLA, OR THE LITTLE
GLASS SLIPPER</h4>

<p>Once there was a gentleman who married,
for his second wife, the proudest and
most haughty woman that was ever seen.
She had, by a former husband, two daughters
of her own humor, who were indeed
exactly like her in all things. He had
likewise, by another wife, a young daughter,
but of unparalleled goodness and
sweetness of temper, which she took from
her mother, who was the best creature in
the world.</p>

<p>No sooner were the ceremonies of the
wedding over but the step-mother began
to show herself in her colors. She could
not bear the good qualities of this pretty
girl; and the less because they made her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
own daughters appear the more odious.
She employed her in the meanest work
of the house; she scoured the dishes and
tables, and cleaned madam's room and
the rooms of misses, her daughters; she
lay up in a sorry garret, upon a wretched
straw-bed, while her sisters lay in fine
rooms, with floors all inlaid, upon beds
of the very newest fashion, and where
they had looking-glasses so large that
they might see themselves at their full
length, from head to foot.</p>

<p>The poor girl bore all patiently, and
dared not tell her father, who would have
rattled her off, for his wife governed him
entirely. When she had done her work,
she used to go into the chimney corner
and sit down among cinders and ashes,
which made her commonly called Cinder-wench;
but the youngest, who was not
so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called
her Cinderella. However, Cinderella,
notwithstanding her mean apparel, was
a hundred times handsomer than her
sisters, though they were always dressed
very richly.</p>

<p>It happened that the king's son gave a
ball, and invited all persons of fashion to
it. Our young misses were also invited,
for they cut a very grand figure among
the quality. They were mightily delighted
at this invitation, and wonderfully
busy in choosing out such gowns,
petticoats, and head-clothes as might
best become them. This was a new
trouble to Cinderella, for it was she who
ironed her sisters' linen and plaited their
ruffles. They talked all day long of
nothing but how they should be dressed.
"For my part," said the eldest, "I will
wear my red velvet suit with French
trimmings."</p>

<p>"And I," said the youngest, "shall
only have my usual petticoat; but then,
to make amends for that, I will put on
my gold flowered manteau and my diamond
stomacher, which is far from being
the most ordinary one in the world."
They sent for the best tire-woman they
could get to make up their head-dresses,
and they had their patches from the very
best maker.</p>

<p>Cinderella was likewise called up to
them to be consulted in all these matters,
for she had excellent notions and advised
them always for the best; nay, and
offered her service to dress their heads,
which they were very willing she should
do. As she was doing this, they said to
her, "Cinderella, would you not be glad
to go to the ball?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said she, "you only jeer at me;
it is not for such as I am to go thither."</p>

<p>"Thou art in the right of it," replied
they; "it would make the people laugh
to see a cinder-wench at a ball."</p>

<p>Any one but Cinderella would have
dressed their heads awry, but she was
very good, and dressed them perfectly
well. They were almost two days without
eating, so much they were transported
with joy. They broke above a
dozen of laces in trying to be laced up
close, that they might have a fine slender
shape, and they were continually at their
looking-glass. At last the happy day
came. They went to court, and Cinderella
followed them with her eyes as long
as she could, and when she had lost
sight of them, she fell a-crying.</p>

<p>Her godmother, who saw her all in
tears, asked her what was the matter.
"I wish I could&mdash;I wish I could&mdash;"; she
was not able to speak the rest, being
interrupted by her tears and sobbing.</p>

<p>This godmother of hers, who was a
fairy, said to her, "Thou wishest thou
couldest go to the ball. Is it not so?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Y&mdash;es," cried Cinderella with a
great sigh.</p>

<p>"Well," said her godmother, "be but
a good girl, and I will contrive that thou
shalt go."</p>

<p>Then she took her into her chamber
and said to her, "Run into the garden
and bring me a pumpkin." Cinderella
went immediately to gather the finest
she could get, and brought it to her godmother,
not being able to imagine how
this pumpkin could make her go to the
ball. Her godmother scooped out all
the inside of it, having left nothing but
the rind; which done, she struck it with
her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly
turned into a fine coach, gilded all over
with gold.</p>

<p>She then went to look into her mouse-trap,
where she found six mice, all alive,
and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little
the trap-door. Then she gave each
mouse, as it went out, a little tap with
her wand, and the mouse was that
moment turned into a fair horse. All
together the mice made a very fine set of
six horses of a beautiful mouse-colored
dapple-gray. Being at a loss for a
coachman, "I will go and see," said
Cinderella, "if there be never a rat in
the rat-trap, that we may make a coachman
of him."</p>

<p>"Thou art in the right," replied her
godmother; "go and look."</p>

<p>Cinderella brought the trap to her, and
in it there were three huge rats. The
fairy made choice of one of the three,
which had the largest beard, and, having
touched him with her wand, he was
turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who
had the smartest whiskers that eyes ever
beheld.</p>

<p>After that her godmother said to her,
"Go again into the garden and you
will find six lizards behind the watering
pot; bring them to me." She had no
sooner done so, than the fairy turned
them into six footmen, who skipped up
immediately behind the coach, with their
liveries all bedecked with gold and silver,
and clung as close behind each other as if
they had done nothing else their whole
lives. The fairy then said to Cinderella,
"Well, you see here an equipage fit to
go to the ball with. Are you not pleased
with it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," cried she, "but must I go
thither as I am, in these filthy rags?"
Her godmother only just touched her
with her wand, and at the same instant
her clothes were turned into cloth of
gold and silver, all beset with jewels.
This done, she gave her a pair of glass
slippers, the prettiest in the whole world.</p>

<p>Being thus decked out, she got up into
her coach; but her godmother, above all
things, commanded her not to stay till
after midnight, telling her that if she
stayed at the ball one moment longer,
her coach would be a pumpkin again,
her horses mice, her coachman a rat,
her footmen lizards, and her clothes just
as they were before.</p>

<p>She promised her godmother she would
not fail of leaving the ball before midnight;
and then away she drives, scarce
able to contain herself for joy. The
king's son, who was told that a great
princess, whom nobody knew, was come,
ran out to receive her. He gave her his
hand as she alighted from the coach,
and led her into the hall among all the
company. There was immediately a
profound silence. They left off dancing,
and the violins ceased to play, so attentive
was every one to contemplate the singular
beauties of this unknown new-comer.
Nothing was then heard but a confused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
noise of, "Ha! how handsome she is!
Ha! how handsome she is!" The king
himself, old as he was, could not help
ogling her and telling the queen softly
that it was a long time since he had seen
so beautiful and lovely a creature. All
the ladies were busied in considering her
clothes and head-dress, that they might
have some made next day after the same
pattern, provided they could meet with
such fine materials and as able hands to
make them.</p>

<p>The king's son conducted her to the
most honorable seat and afterwards took
her out to dance with him. She danced
so very gracefully that they all more and
more admired her. A fine collation was
served up, whereof the young prince ate
not a morsel, so intently was he busied
in gazing on her. She went and sat down
by her sisters, showing them a thousand
civilities, giving them part of the oranges
and citrons which the prince had presented
her with; which very much surprised
them, for they did not know
her. While Cinderella was thus amusing
her sisters, she heard the clock strike
eleven and three quarters, whereupon
she immediately made a courtesy to the
company and hasted away as fast as she
could.</p>

<p>Being got home, she ran to seek out
her godmother; and having thanked her,
she said she could not but heartily wish
she might go next day to the ball, because
the king's son had desired her.
As she was eagerly telling her godmother
whatever had passed at the ball, her two
sisters knocked at the door, which Cinderella
ran and opened. "How long you
have stayed!" cried she, gaping, rubbing
her eyes, and stretching herself as if she
had been just awakened out of her sleep;
she had not, however, any manner of
inclination to sleep since they went from
home.</p>

<p>"If thou hadst been at the ball," said
one of her sisters, "thou wouldest not
have been tired with it. There came
thither the finest princess, the most
beautiful ever seen with mortal eyes.
She showed us a thousand civilities and
gave us oranges and citrons." Cinderella
seemed very indifferent in the matter;
indeed, she asked them the name of the
princess, but they told her they did not
know it and that the king's son was very
uneasy on her account and would give
all the world to know who she was.</p>

<p>At this Cinderella, smiling, replied,
"She must then be very beautiful indeed!
How happy have you been! Could not
I see her? Ah! dear Miss Charlotte, do
lend me your yellow suit of clothes,
which you wear every day."</p>

<p>"Ay, to be sure," cried Miss Charlotte,
"lend my clothes to such a dirty
cinder-wench as thou art! Who's the
fool then?" Cinderella indeed expected
some such answer and was very glad of
the refusal, for she would have been sadly
put to it if her sister had lent her what
she asked for jestingly.</p>

<p>The next day the two sisters were at
the ball, and so was Cinderella, but
dressed more magnificently than before.
The king's son was always by her side
and never ceased his compliments and
amorous speeches to her; to whom all
this was so far from being tiresome that
she quite forgot what her godmother had
recommended to her, so that she at last
counted the clock striking twelve when
she took it to be no more than eleven.
She then rose up and fled as nimble as a
deer. The prince followed, but could
not overtake her. She left behind one
of her glass slippers, which the prince<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
took up most carefully. She got home,
but quite out of breath, without coach
or footmen, and in her old cinder clothes,
having nothing left of all her finery but
one of the little slippers, fellow to that
she dropped. The guards at the palace
gate were asked if they had not seen a
princess go out. They said they had
seen nobody go out but a young girl
very meanly dressed, who had more the
air of a poor country wench than a
gentlewoman.</p>

<p>When the two sisters returned from
the ball, Cinderella asked them if they
had been well diverted and if the fine
lady had been there. They told her yes,
but that she hurried away immediately
when it struck twelve and with so much
haste that she dropped one of her little
glass slippers, the prettiest in the world,
which the king's son had taken up; that
he had done nothing but look at her all
the time of the ball, and that most certainly
he was very much in love with
the beautiful person who owned the
little glass slipper.</p>

<p>What they said was very true, for a
few days after, the king's son caused to
be proclaimed by sound of trumpets that
he would marry her whose foot this
slipper would just fit. They whom he
employed began to try it on upon the
princesses, then the duchesses, and all the
court, but in vain. It was brought to the
two sisters, who did all they possibly
could to thrust their foot into the slipper,
but they could not effect it. Cinderella,
who saw all this and knew her slipper,
said to them, laughing, "Let me see if
it will not fit me!"</p>

<p>Her sisters burst out laughing and
began to banter her. The gentleman
who was sent to try the slipper looked
earnestly at Cinderella, and finding her
very handsome, said it was but just that
she should try, and that he had orders
to let every one make trial. He obliged
Cinderella to sit down, and putting the
slipper to her foot, he found it went in
very easily and fitted her as if it had
been made of wax. The astonishment
her two sisters were in was excessively
great, but still abundantly greater when
Cinderella pulled out of her pocket the
other slipper and put it on her foot.
Thereupon in came her godmother, who
having touched, with her wand, Cinderella's
clothes, made them richer and more
magnificent than any of those she had
before.</p>

<p>And now her two sisters found her to
be that fine beautiful lady whom they
had seen at the ball. They threw themselves
at her feet to beg pardon for all
the ill treatment they had made her
undergo. Cinderella took them up, and
as she embraced them, cried that she
forgave them with all her heart and
desired them always to love her. She
was conducted to the young prince,
dressed as she was. He thought her
more charming than ever, and a few
days after, married her. Cinderella, who
was no less good than beautiful, gave her
two sisters lodgings in the palace, and
that very same day matched them with
two great lords of the court.</p>

<div class="hang1">The hero of the next story is often known as
Drakesbill, which easily becomes Bill
Drake. The version that follows is a translation
from the French of Charles Marelles
as given by Lang in his <i>Red Fairy Book</i>. It
has a raciness not in those softened versions
in which one friend gets into a pocket,
another under a wing, and so on. The
persistent energy of the little hero, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
resourcefulness in difficulty, his loyal
friends, the unexpected honor that comes
as recognition of his success, the humor
that pervades every character and incident,
make this one of the most delightful of
children's stories.</div>


<h4><br />DRAKESTAIL</h4>

<p>Drakestail was very little, that is why
he was called Drakestail; but tiny as
he was he had brains, and he knew what
he was about, for having begun with
nothing he ended by amassing a hundred
crowns. Now the king of the country,
who was very extravagant and never
kept any money, having heard that
Drakestail had some, went one day in
his own person to borrow his hoard,
and, my word, in those days Drakestail
was not a little proud of having lent
money to the king. But after the first
and second year, seeing that he never
even dreamed of paying the interest, he
became uneasy, so much so that at last
he resolved to go and see his majesty
himself, and get repaid. So one fine
morning Drakestail, very spruce and
fresh, takes the road, singing: "Quack,
quack, quack, when shall I get my money
back?"</p>

<p>He had not gone far when he met friend
Fox, on his rounds that way.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, neighbor," says the
friend; "where are you off to so early?"</p>

<p>"I am going to the king for what he
owes me."</p>

<p>"Oh! take me with thee!"</p>

<p>Drakestail said to himself: "One can't
have too many friends." Aloud says he,
"I will, but going on all fours you will
soon be tired. Make yourself quite
small, get into my throat&mdash;go into my
gizzard, and I will carry you."</p>

<p>"Happy thought!" says friend Fox.</p>

<p>He takes bag and baggage, and, presto!
is gone like a letter into the post.</p>

<p>And Drakestail is off again, all spruce
and fresh, still singing: "Quack, quack,
quack, when shall I have my money
back?"</p>

<p>He had not gone far when he met his
lady friend, Ladder, leaning on her wall.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, my duckling," says
the lady friend, "whither away so bold?"</p>

<p>"I am going to the king for what he
owes me."</p>

<p>"Oh! take me with thee!"</p>

<p>Drakestail said to himself: "One can't
have too many friends." Aloud says he:
"I will, but then with your wooden legs
you will soon be tired. Make yourself
quite small, get into my throat&mdash;go
into my gizzard, and I will carry you."</p>

<p>"Happy thought!" says my friend
Ladder, and nimble, bag and baggage,
goes to keep company with friend Fox.</p>

<p>And "Quack, quack, quack," Drakestail
is off again, singing and spruce as
before. A little further he meets his
sweetheart, my friend River, wandering
quietly in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Thou, my cherub," says she, "whither
so lonesome, with arching tail, on this
muddy road?"</p>

<p>"I am going to the king, you know,
for what he owes me."</p>

<p>"Oh! take me with thee!"</p>

<p>Drakestail said to himself: "One can't
have too many friends." Aloud says he:
"I will, but you who sleep while you walk
will soon get tired. Make yourself quite
small, get into my throat&mdash;go into my
gizzard, and I will carry you."</p>

<p>"Ah! happy thought!" says my friend
River.</p>

<p>She takes bag and baggage, and glou,
glou, glou she takes her place between
friend Fox and my friend Ladder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>And "Quack, quack, quack," Drakestail
is off again singing.</p>

<p>A little further on he meets comrade
Wasp's-nest, maneuvering his wasps.</p>

<p>"Well, good-morning, friend Drakestail,"
said comrade Wasp's-nest, "where
are we bound for, so spruce and fresh?"</p>

<p>"I am going to the king for what he
owes me."</p>

<p>"Oh! take me with thee!"</p>

<p>Drakestail said to himself, "One can't
have too many friends." Aloud says he:
"I will, but then with your battalion to
drag along, you will soon be tired. Make
yourself quite small, go into my throat&mdash;get
into my gizzard, and I will carry
you."</p>

<p>"By Jove! that's a good idea!" says
comrade Wasp's-nest.</p>

<p>And left file! he takes the same road
to join the others with all his party.
There was not much room, but by closing
up a bit they managed. And Drakestail
is off again singing.</p>

<p>He arrived thus at the capital, and
threaded his way straight up the High
Street, still running and singing, "Quack,
quack, quack, when shall I get my money
back?" to the great astonishment of the
good folks, till he came to the king's
palace.</p>

<p>He strikes with the knocker: "Toc!
toc!"</p>

<p>"Who is there?" asks the porter,
putting his head out of the wicket.</p>

<p>"'Tis I, Drakestail. I wish to speak
to the king."</p>

<p>"Speak to the king! That's easily
said. The king is dining, and will not
be disturbed."</p>

<p>"Tell him that it is I, and I have come
he well knows why."</p>

<p>The porter shuts his wicket and goes
up to say it to the king, who was just
sitting down to dinner with a napkin
round his neck, and all his ministers.</p>

<p>"Good, good!" said the king, laughing.
"I know what it is! Make him come in,
and put him with the turkeys and
chickens."</p>

<p>The porter descends.</p>

<p>"Have the goodness to enter."</p>

<p>"Good!" says Drakestail to himself,
"I shall now see how they eat at court."</p>

<p>"This way, this way," says the porter.
"One step further. There, there you
are."</p>

<p>"How? what? in the poultry-yard?"</p>

<p>Fancy how vexed Drakestail was!</p>

<p>"Ah! so that's it," says he. "Wait!
I will compel you to receive me. Quack,
quack, quack, when shall I get my money
back?" But turkeys and chickens are
creatures who don't like people that are
not as themselves. When they saw the
new-comer and how he was made, and
when they heard him crying too, they
began to look black at him.</p>

<p>"What is it? What does he want?"</p>

<p>Finally they rushed at him all together,
to overwhelm him with pecks.</p>

<p>"I am lost!" said Drakestail to himself,
when by good luck he remembers
his comrade friend Fox, and he cries:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Reynard, Reynard, come out of your earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or Drakestail's life is of little worth."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then friend Fox, who was only waiting
for these words, hastens out, throws
himself on the wicked fowls, and quick!
quack! he tears them to pieces; so much
so that at the end of five minutes there
was not one left alive. And Drakestail,
quite content, began to sing again,
"Quack, quack, quack, when shall I get
my money back?"</p>

<p>When the king, who was still at table,
heard this refrain, and the poultry-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>woman
came to tell him what had been
going on in the yard, he was terribly
annoyed.</p>

<p>He ordered them to throw this tail of
a drake into the well, to make an end of
him.</p>

<p>And it was done as he commanded.
Drakestail was in despair of getting himself
out of such a deep hole, when he
remembered his lady friend Ladder.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Ladder, Ladder, come out of thy hold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or Drakestail's days will soon be told."</span><br />
</div>

<p>My friend Ladder, who was only waiting
for these words, hastens out, leans
her two arms on the edge of the well;
then Drakestail climbs nimbly on her
back, and hop! he is in the yard, where
he begins to sing louder than ever.</p>

<p>When the king, who was still at table
and laughing at the good trick he had
played his creditor, heard him again
reclaiming his money, he became livid
with rage.</p>

<p>He commanded that the furnace should
be heated, and this tail of a drake thrown
into it, because he must be a sorcerer.</p>

<p>The furnace was soon hot, but this
time Drakestail was not so afraid; he
counted on his sweetheart, my friend
River.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"River, River, outward flow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or to death Drakestail must go."</span><br />
</div>

<p>My friend River hastens out, and errouf!
throws herself into the furnace,
which she floods, with all the people who
had lighted it; after which she flowed
growling into the hall of the palace to
the height of more than four feet.</p>

<p>And Drakestail, quite content, begins
to swim, singing deafeningly, "Quack,
quack, quack, when shall I get my money
back?"</p>

<p>The king was still at table, and thought
himself quite sure of his game; but when
he heard Drakestail singing again, and
when they told him all that had passed,
he became furious and got up from the
table brandishing his fists.</p>

<p>"Bring him here, and I'll cut his
throat! Bring him here quick!" cried he.</p>

<p>And quickly two footmen ran to fetch
Drakestail.</p>

<p>"At last," said the poor chap, going up
the great stairs, "they have decided to
receive me."</p>

<p>Imagine his terror when on entering
he sees the king as red as a turkey cock,
and all his ministers attending him standing
sword in hand. He thought this
time it was all up with him. Happily he
remembered that there was still one
remaining friend, and he cried with dying
accents:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Wasp's nest, Wasp's nest, make a sally,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or Drakestail nevermore may rally."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Hereupon the scene changes.</p>

<p>"Bs, bs, bayonet them!" The brave
Wasp's-nest rushes out with all his
wasps. They threw themselves on the
infuriated king and his ministers, and
stung them so fiercely in the face that
they lost their heads, and not knowing
where to hide themselves they all jumped
pell-mell from the window and broke their
necks on the pavement.</p>

<p>Behold Drakestail much astonished,
all alone in the big saloon and master of
the field. He could not get over it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he remembered shortly
what he had come for to the palace, and
improving the occasion, he set to work to
hunt for his dear money. But in vain
he rummaged in all the drawers; he found
nothing; all had been spent.</p>

<p>And ferreting thus from room to room
he came at last to the one with the throne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in it, and feeling fatigued, he sat himself
down on it to think over his adventure.
In the meanwhile the people had found
their king and his ministers with their
feet in the air on the pavement, and they
had gone into the palace to know how it
had occurred. On entering the throne-room,
when the crowd saw that there was
already someone on the royal seat, they
broke out in cries of surprise and joy:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The King is dead, long live the King!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Heaven has sent us down this thing."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Drakestail, who was no longer surprised
at anything, received the acclamations
of the people as if he had never done
anything else all his life.</p>

<p>A few of them certainly murmured
that a Drakestail would make a fine
king; those who knew him replied that a
knowing Drakestail was a more worthy
king than a spendthrift like him who was
lying on the pavement. In short, they
ran and took the crown off the head of the
deceased, and placed it on that of Drakestail,
whom it fitted like wax.</p>

<p>Thus he became king.</p>

<p>"And now," said he after the ceremony,
"ladies and gentlemen, let's go to
supper. I am so hungry!"</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_167" id="Note_167">167</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The story of "Beauty and the Beast," while
very old in its ruder forms, is known to us in
a fine version which comes from the middle
of the eighteenth century. Madame de
Villeneuve, a French writer of some note
and a follower of Perrault in the field of the
fairy tale, published in 1740 a collection of
stories (<i>Contes Marins</i>) supposed to be
told by an old woman during a voyage to
St. Domingo. Among these was "Beauty
and the Beast" in a long-winded style
extending to more than 250 pages. In 1757,
a greatly abridged form of this version
was published by Madame de Beaumont,
who was then living in England and
who wrote many spirited tales designed for
children. Her stories are full of the didactic
element, and "Beauty and the Beast"
is no exception to the rule. These "edifying
commonplaces," however, are so sound
and fit into the story so naturally that the
reader does not suffer from their presence.
The artificial character of the story is easily
felt in contrast to the natural qualities of
a folk version. The plot has all the perfection
of a finished piece of literary art,
and for this quality especially Madame de
Beaumont's abridgement has always been
heartily and rightly admired.</div>


<h4><br />BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</h4>

<p>Once upon a time, in a far-off country,
there lived a merchant who had been so
fortunate in all his undertakings that he
was enormously rich. As he had, however,
six sons and six daughters, he found
that his money was not too much to let
them have everything they fancied, as
they were accustomed to do.</p>

<p>But one day a most unexpected misfortune
befell them. Their house caught
fire and was speedily burned to the
ground, with all the splendid furniture,
the books, pictures, gold, silver, and
precious goods it contained; and this was
only the beginning of their troubles.
Their father, who had until this moment
prospered in all ways, suddenly lost every
ship he had upon the sea, either by dint
of pirates, shipwreck, or fire. Then he
heard that his clerks in distant countries,
whom he had trusted entirely, had proved
unfaithful, and at last from great wealth
he fell into direst poverty.</p>

<p>All that he had left was a little house in
a desolate place at least a hundred leagues
from the town in which he had lived, and
to this he was forced to retreat with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
children, who were in despair at the idea
of leading such a different life. Indeed,
the daughters at first hoped that their
friends, who had been so numerous while
they were rich, would insist on their
staying in their houses now they no longer
possessed one. But they soon found that
they were left alone, and that their
former friends even attributed their misfortunes
to their own extravagance, and
showed no intention of offering them any
help. So nothing was left for them but
to take their departure to the cottage,
which stood in the midst of a dark forest,
and seemed to be the most dismal place
upon the face of the earth.</p>

<p>As they were too poor to have any servants,
the girls had to work hard, like
peasants, and the sons, for their part,
cultivated the fields to earn their living.
Roughly clothed, and living in the simplest
way, the girls regretted unceasingly
the luxuries and amusements of their
former life; only the youngest tried to be
brave and cheerful. She had been as sad
as anyone when the misfortune first overtook
her father, but, soon recovering her
natural gayety, she set to work to make
the best of things, to amuse her father
and brothers as well as she could, and to
try to persuade her sisters to join her in
dancing and singing. But they would
do nothing of the sort, and because she
was not as doleful as themselves they
declared that this miserable life was all
she was fit for. But she was really far
prettier and cleverer than they were;
indeed, she was so lovely that she was
always called Beauty. After two years,
when they were all beginning to get used
to their new life, something happened to
disturb their tranquillity. Their father
received the news that one of his ships,
which he had believed to be lost, had
come safely into port with a rich cargo.</p>

<p>All the sons and daughters at once
thought that their poverty was at an end
and wanted to set out directly for the
town, but their father, who was more
prudent, begged them to wait a little,
and though it was harvest-time and he
could ill be spared, determined to go himself
first to make inquiries. Only the
youngest daughter had any doubt but
that they would soon be as rich as they
were before, or at least rich enough to
live comfortably in some town where
they would find amusement and gay companions
once more. So they all loaded
their father with commissions for jewels
and dresses which it would have taken a
fortune to buy; only Beauty, feeling sure
that it was of no use, did not ask for anything.
Her father, noticing her silence,
said: "And what shall I bring for you,
Beauty?"</p>

<p>"The only thing I wish for is to see
you come home safely," she answered.</p>

<p>But this reply vexed her sisters, who
fancied she was blaming them for having
asked for such costly things. Her
father was pleased, but as he thought
that at her age she certainly ought to
like pretty presents, he told her to choose
something.</p>

<p>"Well, dear father," said she, "as you
insist upon it, I beg that you will bring
me a rose. I have not seen one since
we came here, and I love them so much."</p>

<p>So the merchant set out and reached
the town as quickly as possible, but only
to find that his former companions,
believing him to be dead, had divided
between them the goods which the ship
had brought; and after six months of
trouble and expense he found himself as
poor as when he started, having been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
able to recover only just enough to pay
the cost of the journey. To make matters
worse, he was obliged to leave the
town in terrible weather, so that by the
time he was within a few leagues of his
home he was almost exhausted with cold
and fatigue. Though he knew it would
take some hours to get through the forest,
he was so anxious to be at his journey's
end that he resolved to go on; but night
overtook him, and the deep snow and
bitter frost made it impossible for his
horse to carry him any further. Not a
house was to be seen. The only shelter
he could get was the hollow trunk of a
great tree, and there he crouched all the
night, which seemed to him the longest
he had ever known. In spite of his
weariness the howling of the wolves
kept him awake, and even when at last
the day broke he was not much better
off, for the falling snow had covered up
every path and he did not know which
way to turn.</p>

<p>At length he made out some sort of
track, and though at the beginning it
was so rough and slippery that he fell
down more than once, it presently
became easier and led him into an avenue
of trees which ended in a splendid castle.
It seemed to the merchant very strange
that no snow had fallen in the avenue,
which was entirely composed of orange-trees,
covered with flowers and fruit.
When he reached the first court of the
castle he saw before him a flight of agate
steps, and went up them and passed
through several splendidly furnished
rooms. The pleasant warmth of the air
revived him and he felt very hungry;
but there seemed to be nobody in all
this vast and splendid palace whom he
could ask to give him something to eat.
Deep silence reigned everywhere, and at
last, tired of roaming through empty
rooms and galleries, he stopped in a room
smaller than the rest, where a clear fire
was burning and a couch was drawn up
cozily, close to it. Thinking that this
must be prepared for some one who was
expected, he sat down to wait till he
should come and very soon fell into a
sweet sleep.</p>

<p>When his extreme hunger wakened
him after several hours he was still alone,
but a little table, upon which was a
good dinner, had been drawn up close
to him, and as he had eaten nothing for
twenty-four hours he lost no time in
beginning his meal, hoping that he might
soon have an opportunity of thanking
his considerate entertainer, whoever it
might be. But no one appeared, and
even after another long sleep, from which
he awoke completely refreshed, there was
no sign of anybody, though a fresh meal
of dainty cakes and fruit was prepared
upon a little table at his elbow. Being
naturally timid, the silence began to
terrify him, and he resolved to search
once more through all the rooms; but
it was of no use. Not even a servant
was to be seen; there was no sign of
life in the palace! He began to wonder
what he should do, and to amuse himself
by pretending that all the treasures
he saw were his own, and considering
how he would divide them among his
children. Then he went down into the
garden, and though it was winter everywhere
else, here the sun shone, and the
birds sang, and the flowers bloomed, and
the air was soft and sweet. The merchant,
in ecstasies with all he saw and
heard, said to himself:</p>

<p>"All this must be meant for me. I
will go this minute and bring my children
to share all these delights."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of being so cold and weary
when he reached the castle, he had taken
his horse to the stable and fed it. Now
he thought he would saddle it for his
homeward journey, and he turned down
the path which led to the stable. This
path had a hedge of roses on each side
of it, and the merchant thought he had
never seen or smelled such exquisite
flowers. They reminded him of his promise
to Beauty, and he stopped and had
just gathered one to take to her when
he was startled by a strange noise behind
him. Turning round he saw a frightful
beast, which seemed to be very angry
and said in a terrible voice: "Who told
you that you might gather my roses?
Was it not enough that I allowed you
to be in my palace and was kind to you?
This is the way you show your gratitude,
by stealing my flowers! But your insolence
shall not go unpunished."</p>

<p>The merchant, terrified by these furious
words, dropped the fatal rose, and
throwing himself on his knees cried:
"Pardon me, noble sir. I am truly
grateful to you for your hospitality,
which was so magnificent that I could
not imagine that you would be offended
by my taking such a little thing as a
rose." But the beast's anger was not
lessened by this speech.</p>

<p>"You are very ready with excuses and
flattery," he cried; "but that will not
save you from the death you deserve."</p>

<p>"Alas!" thought the merchant, "if my
daughter Beauty could only know what
danger her rose has brought me into!"</p>

<p>And in despair be began to tell the
beast all his misfortunes and the reason
of his journey, not forgetting to mention
Beauty's request.</p>

<p>"A king's ransom would hardly have
procured all that my other daughters
asked," he said, "but I thought that I
might at least take Beauty her rose.
I beg you to forgive me, for you see
I meant no harm."</p>

<p>The beast considered for a moment,
and then he said in a less furious tone:</p>

<p>"I will forgive you on one condition&mdash;that
is, that you will give me one of your
daughters."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the merchant, "if I were
cruel enough to buy my own life at the
expense of one of my children's, what
excuse could I invent to bring her here?"</p>

<p>"No excuse would be necessary,"
answered the beast. "If she comes at
all she must come willingly. On no
other condition will I have her. See
if any one of them is courageous enough
and loves you well enough to come and
save your life. You seem to be an
honest man, so I will trust you to go
home. I give you a month to see if
either of your daughters will come back
with you and stay here, to let you go
free. If neither of them is willing you
must come alone, after bidding them
good-by forever, for then you will
belong to me. And do not imagine that
you can hide from me, for if you fail
to keep your word I will come and
fetch you!" added the beast grimly.</p>

<p>The merchant accepted this proposal,
though he did not really think any of
his daughters would be persuaded to
come. He promised to return at the
time appointed, and then, anxious to
escape from the presence of the beast,
he asked permission to set off at once.
But the beast answered that he could
not go until the next day.</p>

<p>"Then you will find a horse ready for
you," he said. "Now go and eat your
supper and await my orders."</p>

<p>The poor merchant, more dead than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
alive, went back to his room, where the
most delicious supper was already served
on the little table which was drawn up
before a blazing fire. But he was too
terrified to eat, and only tasted a few of
the dishes, for fear the beast should be
angry if he did not obey his orders.
When he had finished he heard a great
noise in the next room, which he knew
meant that the beast was coming. As
he could do nothing to escape his visit,
the only thing that remained was to seem
as little afraid as possible; so when the
beast appeared and asked roughly if he
had supped well, the merchant answered
humbly that he had, thanks to his host's
kindness. Then the beast warned him
to remember their agreement and to
prepare his daughter exactly for what she
had to expect.</p>

<p>"Do not get up to-morrow," he added,
"until you see the sun and hear a golden
bell ring. Then you will find your
breakfast waiting for you here, and the
horse you are to ride will be ready in
the court-yard. He will also bring you
back again when you come with your
daughter a month hence. Farewell.
Take a rose to Beauty, and remember
your promise."</p>

<p>The merchant was only too glad when
the beast went away, and though he
could not sleep for sadness, he lay down
until the sun rose. Then, after a hasty
breakfast, he went to gather Beauty's
rose and mounted his horse, which carried
him off so swiftly that in an instant
he had lost sight of the palace, and he
was still wrapped in gloomy thoughts
when it stopped before the door of the
cottage.</p>

<p>His sons and daughters, who had been
very uneasy at his long absence, rushed
to meet him, eager to know the result
of his journey, which, seeing him mounted
upon a splendid horse and wrapped in a
rich mantle, they supposed to be favorable.
But he hid the truth from them at
first, only saying sadly to Beauty as he
gave her the rose:</p>

<p>"Here is what you asked me to bring
you. You little know what it has cost."</p>

<p>But this excited their curiosity so
greatly that presently he told them his
adventures from beginning to end, and
then they were all very unhappy. The
girls lamented loudly over their lost
hopes, and the sons declared that their
father should not return to this terrible
castle, and began to make plans for killing
the beast if it should come to fetch him.
But he reminded them that he had promised
to go back. Then the girls were very
angry with Beauty and said it was all
her fault, and that if she had asked for
something sensible this would never have
happened, and complained bitterly that
they should have to suffer for her folly.</p>

<p>Poor Beauty, much distressed, said to
them:</p>

<p>"I have indeed caused this misfortune,
but I assure you I did it innocently.
Who could have guessed that to ask for
a rose in the middle of summer would
cause so much misery? But as I did the
mischief it is only just that I should
suffer for it. I will therefore go back
with my father to keep his promise."</p>

<p>At first nobody would hear of this
arrangement, and her father and brothers,
who loved her dearly, declared that
nothing should make them let her go;
but Beauty was firm. As the time drew
near she divided all her little possessions
between her sisters and said good-by to
everything she loved, and when the fatal
day came she encouraged and cheered
her father as they mounted together the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
horse which had brought him back. It
seemed to fly rather than gallop, but so
smoothly that Beauty was not frightened;
indeed, she would have enjoyed the
journey if she had not feared what might
happen to her at the end of it. Her
father still tried to persuade her to go
back, but in vain. While they were
talking the night fell, and then, to their
surprise, wonderful colored lights began
to shine in all directions, and splendid
fireworks blazed out before them. All
the forest was illuminated by them, and
even felt pleasantly warm, though it had
been bitterly cold before. This lasted
until they reached the avenue of orange-trees,
where were statues holding flaming
torches, and when they got nearer to the
palace they saw that it was illuminated
from the roof to the ground, and music
sounded softly from the court-yard. "The
beast must be very hungry," said Beauty,
trying to laugh, "if he makes all this rejoicing
over the arrival of his prey."</p>

<p>But in spite of her anxiety she could
not help admiring all the wonderful
things she saw.</p>

<p>The horse stopped at the foot of the
flight of steps leading to the terrace, and
when they had dismounted her father
led her to the little room he had been
in before, where they found a splendid
fire burning and the table daintily spread
with a delicious supper.</p>

<p>The merchant knew that this was
meant for them, and Beauty, who was
rather less frightened now that she had
passed through so many rooms and seen
nothing of the beast, was quite willing
to begin, for her long ride had made her
very hungry. But they had hardly finished
their meal when the noise of the
beast's footsteps was heard approaching,
and Beauty clung to her father in terror,
which became all the greater when she
saw how frightened he was. But when
the beast really appeared, though she
trembled at the sight of him, she made a
great effort to hide her horror and saluted
him respectfully.</p>

<p>This evidently pleased the beast.
After looking at her he said, in a tone
that might have struck terror into the
boldest heart, though he did not seem
to be angry:</p>

<p>"Good-evening, old man. Good-evening,
Beauty."</p>

<p>The merchant was too terrified to
reply, but Beauty answered sweetly:</p>

<p>"Good-evening, beast."</p>

<p>"Have you come willingly?" asked the
beast. "Will you be content to stay
here when your father goes away?"</p>

<p>Beauty answered bravely that she was
quite prepared to stay.</p>

<p>"I am pleased with you," said the
beast. "As you have come of your own
accord, you may stay. As for you, old
man," he added, turning to the merchant,
"at sunrise to-morrow you will take your
departure. When the bell rings get up
quickly and eat your breakfast, and you
will find the same horse waiting to take
you home; but remember that you must
never expect to see my palace again."</p>

<p>Then turning to Beauty he said:</p>

<p>"Take your father into the next room
and help him to choose everything you
think your brothers and sisters would
like to have. You will find two traveling-trunks
there; fill them as full as you can.
It is only just that you should send them
something very precious as a remembrance
of yourself."</p>

<p>Then he went away after saying,
"Good-by, Beauty; good-by, old man";
and though Beauty was beginning to
think with great dismay of her father's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
departure, she was afraid to disobey the
beast's orders, and they went into the
next room, which had shelves and cupboards
all round it. They were greatly
surprised at the riches it contained.
There were splendid dresses fit for a
queen, with all the ornaments that were
to be worn with them; and when Beauty
opened the cupboards she was quite
dazzled by the gorgeous jewels that lay
in heaps upon every shelf. After choosing
a vast quantity, which she divided
between her sisters&mdash;for she made a heap
of the wonderful dresses for each of them&mdash;she
opened the last chest, which was
full of gold.</p>

<p>"I think, father," she said, "that as
the gold will be more useful to you we
had better take out the other things again
and fill the trunks with it." So they did
this; but the more they put in the more
room there seemed to be, and at last they
put back all the jewels and dresses they
had taken out, and Beauty even added as
many more of the jewels as she could
carry at once; and then the trunks were
not too full, but they were so heavy that
an elephant could not have carried them!</p>

<p>"The beast was mocking us," cried the
merchant. "He must have pretended to
give us all these things, knowing that I
could not carry them away."</p>

<p>"Let us wait and see," answered Beauty.
"I cannot believe that he meant to deceive
us. All we can do is to fasten them up and
leave them ready."</p>

<p>So they did this and returned to the
little room, where, to their astonishment,
they found breakfast ready. The merchant
ate his with a good appetite, as the
beast's generosity made him believe that
he might perhaps venture to come back
soon and see Beauty. But she felt sure
that her father was leaving her forever,
so she was very sad when the bell rang
sharply for the second time and warned
them that the time had come for them to
part. They went down into the court-yard,
where two horses were waiting, one
loaded with the two trunks, the other for
him to ride. They were pawing the
ground in their impatience to start, and,
the merchant was forced to bid Beauty
a hasty farewell; and as soon as he was
mounted he went off at such a pace that
she lost sight of him in an instant.</p>

<p>Then Beauty began to cry and wandered
back to her own room. But she
soon found that she was very sleepy, and
as she had nothing better to do she lay
down and instantly fell asleep. And
then she dreamed that she was walking
by a brook bordered with trees and
lamenting her sad fate, when a young
prince, handsomer than anyone she had
ever seen, and with a voice that went
straight to her heart, came and said to
her: "Ah, Beauty! you are not so unfortunate
as you suppose. Here you will
be rewarded for all you have suffered
elsewhere. Your every wish shall be
gratified. Only try to find me out, no
matter how I may be disguised, as I love
you dearly, and in making me happy you
will find your own happiness. Be as
true-hearted as you are beautiful, and
we shall have nothing left to wish for."</p>

<p>"What can I do, prince, to make you
happy?" said Beauty.</p>

<p>"Only be grateful," he answered, "and
do not trust too much to your eyes. And
above all, do not desert me until you have
saved me from my cruel misery."</p>

<p>After this she thought she found herself
in a room with a stately and beautiful
lady, who said to her:</p>

<p>"Dear Beauty, try not to regret all
you have left behind you, for you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
destined to a better fate. Only do not
let yourself be deceived by appearances."</p>

<p>Beauty found her dreams so interesting
that she was in no hurry to awake, but
presently the clock roused her by calling
her name softly twelve times, and then
she got up and found her dressing-table
set out with everything she could possibly
want; and when her toilet was finished she
found dinner was waiting in the room next
to hers. But dinner does not take very
long when you are all by yourself, and
very soon she sat down cozily in the
corner of a sofa and began to think
about the charming prince she had seen
in her dream.</p>

<p>"He said I could make him happy,"
said Beauty to herself. "It seems, then,
that this horrible beast keeps him a
prisoner. How can I set him free? I
wonder why they both told me not to
trust to appearances. I don't understand
it. But after all it is only a dream,
so why should I trouble myself about it?
I had better go and find something to
do to amuse myself."</p>

<p>So she got up and began to explore
some of the many rooms of the palace.</p>

<p>The first she entered was lined with
mirrors, and Beauty saw herself reflected
on every side, and thought she had never
seen such a charming room. Then a
bracelet which was hanging from a
chandelier caught her eye, and on taking
it down she was greatly surprised to find
that it held a portrait of her unknown
admirer, just as she had seen him in her
dream. With great delight she slipped
the bracelet on her arm and went on into
a gallery of pictures, where she soon
found a portrait of the same handsome
prince, as large as life and so well painted
that as she studied it he seemed to smile
kindly at her.</p>

<p>Tearing herself away from the portrait
at last, she passed through into a
room which contained every musical instrument
under the sun, and here she
amused herself for a long while in trying
some of them and singing until she was
tired. The next room was a library,
and she saw everything she had ever
wanted to read, as well as everything she
had read, and it seemed to her that a
whole lifetime would not be enough even
to read the names of the books, there
were so many. By this time it was growing
dusk, and wax candles in diamond
and ruby candlesticks were beginning to
light themselves in every room.</p>

<p>Beauty found her supper served just
at the time she preferred to have it, but
she did not see anyone or hear a sound,
and though her father had warned her
that she would be alone, she began to find
it rather dull.</p>

<p>But presently she heard the beast
coming, and wondered tremblingly if he
meant to eat her up now.</p>

<p>However, as he did not seem at all
ferocious, and only said gruffly, "Good-evening,
Beauty," she answered cheerfully
and managed to conceal her terror.
Then the beast asked her how she had
been amusing herself, and she told him
all the rooms she had seen.</p>

<p>Then he asked if she thought she could
be happy in his palace, and Beauty
answered that everything was so beautiful
that she would be very hard to please
if she could not be happy. And after
about an hour's talk Beauty began to
think that the beast was not nearly so
terrible as she had supposed at first.
Then he got up to leave her and said in
his gruff voice:</p>

<p>"Do you love me, Beauty? Will you
marry me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! what shall I say?" cried Beauty,
for she was afraid to make the beast
angry by refusing.</p>

<p>"Say 'yes' or 'no' without fear," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, beast," said Beauty hastily.</p>

<p>"Since you will not, good-night,
Beauty," he said. And she answered,
"Good-night, beast," very glad to find
that her refusal had not provoked him.
And after he was gone she was very soon
in bed and asleep and dreaming of her
unknown prince. She thought he came
and said to her:</p>

<p>"Ah, Beauty! why are you so unkind
to me? I fear I am fated to be unhappy
for many a long day still."</p>

<p>And then her dreams changed, but the
charming prince figured in them all; and
when morning came her first thought
was to look at the portrait and see if it
was really like him, and she found that
it certainly was.</p>

<p>This morning she decided to amuse
herself in the garden, for the sun shone
and all the fountains were playing; but
she was astonished to find that every
place was familiar to her, and presently
she came to the brook where the myrtle
trees were growing where she had first
met the prince in her dream, and that
made her think more than ever that he
must be kept a prisoner by the beast.
When she was tired she went back to
the palace, and found a new room full
of materials for every kind of work&mdash;ribbons
to make into bows and silks to
work into flowers. Then there was an
aviary full of rare birds, which were so
tame that they flew to Beauty as soon as
they saw her and perched upon her
shoulders and her head.</p>

<p>"Pretty little creatures," she said,
"how I wish that your cage was nearer
to my room, that I might often hear you
sing!"</p>

<p>So saying she opened a door and found
to her delight that it led into her own
room, though she had thought it was
quite the other side of the palace.</p>

<p>There were more birds in a room further
on, parrots and cockatoos that could
talk, and they greeted Beauty by name.
Indeed, she found them so entertaining
that she took one or two back to her
room, and they talked to her while she
was at supper; after which the beast
paid her his usual visit and asked the
same questions as before, and then with a
gruff "good-night" he took his departure,
and Beauty went to bed to dream
of her mysterious prince. The days
passed swiftly in different amusements,
and after a while Beauty found out
another strange thing in the palace,
which often pleased her when she was
tired of being alone. There was one
room which she had not noticed particularly.
It was empty, except that under
each of the windows stood a very comfortable
chair, and the first time she had
looked out of the window it had seemed
to her that a black curtain prevented her
from seeing anything outside. But the
second time she went into the room,
happening to be tired, she sat down in
one of the chairs, and instantly the curtain
was rolled aside and a most amusing
pantomime was acted before her. There
were dances, and colored lights, and
music, and pretty dresses, and it was all
so gay that Beauty was in ecstasies.
After that she tried the other seven windows
in turn, and there was some new
and surprising entertainment to be seen
from each of them, so that Beauty never
could feel lonely any more. Every evening
after supper the beast came to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
her, and always before saying good-night
asked her in his terrible voice:</p>

<p>"Beauty, will you marry me?"</p>

<p>And it seemed to Beauty, now she
understood him better, that when she
said, "No, beast," he went away quite
sad. But her happy dreams of the handsome
young prince soon made her forget
the poor beast, and the only thing that
at all disturbed her was to be constantly
told to distrust appearances, to let her
heart guide her, and not her eyes, and
many other equally perplexing things,
which, consider as she would, she could
not understand.</p>

<p>So everything went on for a long time,
until at last, happy as she was, Beauty
began to long for the sight of her father
and her brothers and sisters; and one
night, seeing her look very sad, the beast
asked her what was the matter. Beauty
had quite ceased to be afraid of him now
she knew that he was really gentle in
spite of his ferocious looks and his dreadful
voice. So she answered that she was
longing to see her home once more.
Upon hearing this the beast seemed sadly
distressed and cried miserably:</p>

<p>"Ah! Beauty, have you the heart to
desert an unhappy beast like this? What
more do you want to make you happy?
Is it because you hate me that you want
to escape?"</p>

<p>"No, dear beast," answered Beauty
softly, "I do not hate you, and I should
be very sorry never to see you any more,
but I long to see my father again. Only
let me go for two months, and I promise
to come back to you and stay for the
rest of my life."</p>

<p>The beast, who had been sighing dolefully
while she spoke, now replied:</p>

<p>"I cannot refuse you anything you
ask, even though it should cost me my
life. Take the four boxes you will find
in the room next to your own and fill
them with everything you wish to take
with you. But remember your promise
and come back when the two months
are over, or you may have cause to
repent it, for if you do not come in
good time you will find your faithful
beast dead. You will not need any
chariot to bring you back. Only say
good-by to all your brothers and sisters
the night before you come away, and
when you have gone to bed turn this
ring round upon your finger and say
firmly: 'I wish to go back to my palace
and see my beast again.' Good-night,
Beauty. Fear nothing, sleep peacefully,
and before long you shall see your father
once more."</p>

<p>As soon as Beauty was alone she
hastened to fill the boxes with all the
rare and precious things she saw about
her, and only when she was tired of
heaping things into them did they seem
to be full.</p>

<p>Then she went to bed, but could hardly
sleep for joy. And when at last she did
begin to dream of her beloved prince
she was grieved to see him stretched upon
a grassy bank, sad and weary and hardly
like himself.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she cried.</p>

<p>But he looked at her reproachfully
and said:</p>

<p>"How can you ask me, cruel one?
Are you not leaving me to my death
perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Ah, don't be so sorrowful!" cried
Beauty. "I am only going to assure
my father that I am safe and happy.
I have promised the beast faithfully
that I will come back, and he would
die of grief if I did not keep my word!"</p>

<p>"What would that matter to you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
said the prince. "Surely you would not
care?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I should be ungrateful if I
did not care for such a kind beast," cried
Beauty indignantly. "I would die to
save him from pain. I assure you it is
not his fault that he is so ugly."</p>

<p>Just then a strange sound woke her&mdash;someone
was speaking not very far away;
and opening her eyes she found herself
in a room she had never seen before,
which was certainly not nearly so splendid
as those she was used to in the
beast's palace. Where could she be?
She got up and dressed hastily, and
then saw that the boxes she had packed
the night before were all in the room.
While she was wondering by what magic
the beast had transported them and
herself to this strange place she suddenly
heard her father's voice, and rushed out
and greeted him joyfully. Her brothers
and sisters were all astonished at her
appearance, as they had never expected
to see her again, and there was no end
to the questions they asked her. She
had also much to hear about what had
happened to them while she was away and
of her father's journey home. But when
they heard that she had only come to
be with them for a short time, and then
must go back to the beast's palace
forever, they lamented loudly. Then
Beauty asked her father what he thought
could be the meaning of her strange
dreams, and why the prince constantly
begged her not to trust to appearances.
After much consideration he answered:</p>

<p>"You tell me yourself that the beast,
frightful as he is, loves you dearly and
deserves your love and gratitude for
his gentleness and kindness. I think
the prince must mean you to understand
that you ought to reward him by doing
as he wishes you to, in spite of his
ugliness."</p>

<p>Beauty could not help seeing that this
seemed very probable. Still, when she
thought of her dear prince who was so
handsome, she did not feel at all inclined
to marry the beast. At any rate, for
two months she need not decide, but
could enjoy herself with her sisters. But
though they were rich now and lived in
a town again and had plenty of acquaintances,
Beauty found that nothing amused
her very much; and she often thought of
the palace where she was so happy,
especially as at home she never once
dreamed of her dear prince, and she felt
quite sad without him.</p>

<p>Then her sisters seemed to have got
used to being without her, and even
found her rather in the way, so she
would not have been sorry when the
two months were over but for her father
and brothers, who begged her to stay
and seemed so grieved at the thought of
her departure that she had not the
courage to say good-by to them. Every
day when she got up she meant to say
it at night, and when night came she
put it off again, until at last she had a
dismal dream which helped her to make
up her mind. She thought she was
wandering in a lonely path in the palace
gardens, when she heard groans which
seemed to come from some bushes hiding
the entrance of a cave, and running
quickly to see what could be the matter,
she found the beast stretched out upon
his side, apparently dying. He reproached
her faintly with being the
cause of his distress, and at the same
moment a stately lady appeared and
said very gravely:</p>

<p>"Ah, Beauty! you are only just in
time to save his life. See what happens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
when people do not keep their promises!
If you had delayed one day more you
would have found him dead."</p>

<p>Beauty was so terrified by this dream
that the next morning she announced
her intention of going back at once, and
that very night she said good-by to her
father and all her brothers and sisters,
and as soon as she was in bed she turned
her ring round upon her finger and said
firmly, "I wish to go back to my palace
and see my beast again," as she had been
told to do.</p>

<p>Then she fell asleep instantly, and
only woke up to hear the clock saying
"Beauty, Beauty," twelve times in its
musical voice, which told her at once
that she was really in the palace once
more. Everything was just as before,
and her birds were so glad to see her;
but Beauty thought she had never known
such a long day, for she was so anxious
to see the beast again that she felt as
if supper time would never come.</p>

<p>But when it did come and no beast
appeared she was really frightened; so
after listening and waiting for a long
time she ran down into the garden to
search for him. Up and down the paths
and avenues ran poor Beauty, calling
him in vain, for no one answered and
not a trace of him could she find, until
at last, quite tired, she stopped for a
minute's rest and saw that she was
standing opposite the shady path she
had seen in her dream. She rushed
down it, and, sure enough, there was
the cave, and in it lay the beast&mdash;asleep,
as Beauty thought. Quite glad to have
found him, she ran up and stroked his
head, but, to her horror, he did not
move or open his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh! he is dead, and it is all my
fault," said Beauty, crying bitterly.</p>

<p>But then, looking at him again, she
fancied he still breathed, and hastily
fetching some water from the nearest fountain,
she sprinkled it over his face, and
to her great delight he began to revive.</p>

<p>"Oh, beast! how you frightened me!"
she cried. "I never knew how much I
loved you until just now, when I feared
I was too late to save your life."</p>

<p>"Can you really love such an ugly
creature as I am?" said the beast faintly.
"Ah, Beauty! you only came just in
time. I was dying because I thought
you had forgotten your promise. But
go back now and rest. I shall see you
again by and by."</p>

<p>Beauty, who had half expected that
he would be angry with her, was reassured
by his gentle voice and went
back to the palace, where supper was
awaiting her; and afterward the beast
came in as usual and talked about the
time she had spent with her father, asking
if she had enjoyed herself and if they
had all been very glad to see her.</p>

<p>Beauty answered politely, and quite
enjoyed telling him all that had happened
to her. And when at last the
time came for him to go, and he asked,
as he had so often asked before, "Beauty,
will you marry me?" she answered softly:
"Yes, dear beast."</p>

<p>As she spoke a blaze of light sprang
up before the windows of the palace;
fireworks crackled and guns banged,
and across the avenue of orange trees,
in letters all made of fireflies, was written:
"Long live the prince and his bride."</p>

<p>Turning to ask the beast what it could
all mean, Beauty found that he had disappeared,
and in his place stood her
long-loved prince! At the same moment
the wheels of a chariot were heard upon
the terrace and two ladies entered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
room. One of them Beauty recognized
as the stately lady she had seen in her
dreams; the other was also so grand and
queenly that Beauty hardly knew which
to greet first.</p>

<p>But the one she already knew said to
her companion:</p>

<p>"Well, queen, this is Beauty, who has
had the courage to rescue your son from
the terrible enchantment. They love
one another, and only your consent to
their marriage is wanting to make them
perfectly happy."</p>

<p>"I consent with all my heart," cried the
queen. "How can I ever thank you
enough, charming girl, for having restored
my dear son to his natural form?"</p>

<p>And then she tenderly embraced
Beauty and the prince, who had meanwhile
been greeting the fairy and receiving
her congratulations.</p>

<p>"Now," said the fairy to Beauty, "I
suppose you would like me to send for
all your brothers and sisters to dance
at your wedding?"</p>

<p>And so she did, and the marriage was
celebrated the very next day with the
utmost splendor, and Beauty and the
prince lived happily ever after.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_168" id="Note_168">168</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Peter Asbj&ouml;rnsen (1812-1885) and Jorgen
Moe (1813-1882) were the first scientific
collectors of the folk tales of Norway.
Their joint interest in folk tales began when
they were schoolboys wandering on foot
through the country and listening to peasant
stories. This interest continued after
Moe had become a theologian and Asbj&ouml;rnsen
a noted scientist. The latter served
the government as an expert connected
with the survey and development of his
country's natural resources. This resulted
in taking him to all parts of the land, and
he never lost an opportunity to hear and
copy down any folk tale that he found
surviving in the more isolated districts.
In 1842-1844 appeared <i>Norwegian Folk Tales</i>
by Moe and Asbj&ouml;rnsen; in 1845, <i>Norwegian
Fairy Tales and Folk Legends;</i> and
there were subsequent additions. The five
tales following are from these Norse collections.
They were first made accessible in
English in Dasent's <i>Popular Tales from the
Norse</i> (1858). This book with its long
introductory essay on the origin and diffusion
of popular tales constitutes a landmark
in the study of folklore. It and Dasent's
later volume, <i>Tales from the Fjeld</i>, are still,
perhaps, the best sources for versions of
the Norse popular tales. "Why the Bear
Is Stumpy-tailed" belongs to the class of
stories which explain how things happened
to be as they are. It is of great antiquity
and is found over most of the world. The
greatest of all modern nature fairy tales,
Kipling's <i>Just So Stories</i>, are of a similar
type, though told at greater length and, of
course, with infinitely greater art.</div>


<h4><br />WHY THE BEAR IS STUMPY-TAILED</h4>

<p>One day the Bear met the Fox, who
came slinking along with a string of fish
he had stolen.</p>

<p>"Whence did you get those?" asked
the Bear.</p>

<p>"Oh! my Lord Bruin, I've been out
fishing and caught them," said the Fox.</p>

<p>So the Bear had a mind to learn to
fish too, and bade the Fox tell him how
he was to set about it.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's an easy craft for you,"
answered the Fox, "and soon learnt.
You've only got to go upon the ice, and
cut a hole and stick your tail down into
it; and so you must go on holding it
there as long as you can. You're not
to mind if your tail smarts a little; that's
when the fish bite. The longer you hold
it there the more fish you'll get; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
then all at once out with it, with a cross
pull sideways, and with a strong pull
too."</p>

<p>Yes; the Bear did as the Fox had said,
and held his tail a long, long time down
in the hole, till it was fast frozen in.
Then he pulled it out with a cross pull,
and it snapped short off. That's why
Bruin goes about with a stumpy tail
this very day.</p>

<h4><br />THE THREE BILLY-GOATS
GRUFF</h4>

<p>Once on a time there were three Billy-goats
who were to go up to the hillside
to make themselves fat, and the
name of all the three was "Gruff."</p>

<p>On the way up was a bridge over a
burn they had to cross; and under the
bridge lived a great ugly Troll, with eyes
as big as saucers and a nose as long as
a poker.</p>

<p>So first of all came the youngest billy-goat
Gruff to cross the bridge.</p>

<p>"Trip, trap; trip, trap!" went the
bridge.</p>

<p>"WHO'S THAT tripping over my
bridge?" roared the Troll.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is only I, the tiniest billy-goat
Gruff; and I'm going up to the
hill-side to make myself fat," said the
billy-goat, with such a small voice.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"
said the Troll.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm
too little, that I am," said the billy-goat.
"Wait a bit till the second billy-goat
Gruff comes; he's much bigger."</p>

<p>"Well! be off with you," said the
Troll.</p>

<p>A little while after came the second
billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"trip, trap! trip, trap! trip, trap!"</span>
went the bridge.</p>

<p>"WHO'S THAT tripping over my
bridge?" roared the Troll.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's the second billy-goat Gruff,
and I'm going up to the hill-side to make
myself fat," said the billy-goat, who
hadn't such a small voice.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"
said the Troll.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! don't take me. Wait a little
till the big billy-goat Gruff comes; he's
much bigger."</p>

<p>"Very well! be off with you," said the
Troll.</p>

<p>But just then up came the big billy-goat
Gruff.</p>

<p>"TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP,
TRAP!" went the bridge, for the billy-goat
was so heavy that the bridge creaked
and groaned under him.</p>

<p>"WHO'S THAT tramping over my
bridge?" roared the Troll.</p>

<p>"It's I! THE BIG BILLY-GOAT
GRUFF," said the billy-goat, who had
an ugly hoarse voice of his own.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"
roared the Troll.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Well, come along! I've got two spears,<br />
And I'll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;<br />

<p>That was what the big billy-goat said;
and so he flew at the Troll and poked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
his eyes out with his horns, and crushed
him to bits, body and bones, and tossed
him out into the burn, and after that
he went up to the hill-side. There the
billy-goats got so fat they were scarce
able to walk home again; and if the fat
hasn't fallen off them, why they're still
fat; and so,&mdash;</p>

<div class="hang1">The following droll seems to indicate that the
folk had a strain of satirical humor which
they could use with fine effect. The translation
is that of Dasent's <i>Popular Tales
from the Norse</i>. (An old English verse form
of the same story will be found in No. <a href="#Note_146">146</a>.)
The old proverb about the shoemaker sticking
to his last is sure to come to mind as
one reads, but it seems to lose force when
we notice that the "goody" has no trouble
with the mowing, while the good "man"
has much with the housework!</div>


<h4><br />THE HUSBAND WHO WAS TO
MIND THE HOUSE</h4>

<p>Once on a time there was a man so
surly and cross he never thought his
wife did anything right in the house.
So one evening in hay-making time he
came home scolding and swearing and
showing his teeth and making a dust.</p>

<p>"Dear love, don't be so angry; there's
a good man," said his goody; "to-morrow
let's change our work. I'll go out with
the mowers and mow, and you shall mind
the house at home."</p>

<p>Yes! the husband thought that would do
very well. He was quite willing, he said.</p>

<p>So, early next morning, his goody took
a scythe over her neck and went out
into the hay-field with the mowers and
began to mow; but the man was to
mind the house, and do the work at home.</p>

<p>First of all, he wanted to churn the
butter; but when he had churned a
while, he got thirsty, and went down to
the cellar to tap a barrel of ale. So,
just when he had knocked in the bung,
and was putting the tap into the cask,
he heard overhead the pig come into
the kitchen. Then off he ran up the
cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, as
fast as he could, to look after the pig
lest it should upset the churn; but when
he got up, and saw the pig had already
knocked the churn over, and stood there,
rooting and grunting amongst the cream
which was running all over the floor, he
got so wild with rage that he quite forgot
the ale-barrel, and ran at the pig
as hard as he could. He caught it, too,
just as it ran out of doors, and gave it
such a kick that piggy lay for dead on
the spot. Then all at once he remembered
he had the tap in his hand; but
when he got down to the cellar, every
drop of ale had run out of the cask.</p>

<p>Then he went into the dairy and found
enough cream left to fill the churn again,
and so he began to churn, for butter
they must have at dinner. When he
had churned a bit, he remembered that
their milking cow was still shut up in
the byre, and hadn't had a bit to eat
or a drop to drink all the morning,
though the sun was high. Then all at
once he thought 'twas too far to take
her down to the meadow, so he'd just
get her up on the house-top&mdash;for the
house, you must know, was thatched
with sods, and a fine crop of grass was
growing there. Now their house lay close
up against a steep down, and he thought
if he laid a plank across to the thatch at
the back he'd easily get the cow up.</p>

<p>But still he couldn't leave the churn,
for there was his little babe crawling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
about on the floor, and "if I leave it,"
he thought, "the child is safe to upset
it." So he took the churn on his back,
and went out with it; but then he
thought he'd better first water the cow
before he turned her out on the thatch;
so he took up a bucket to draw water
out of the well; but, as he stooped down
at the well's brink, all the cream ran
out of the churn over his shoulders, and
so down into the well.</p>

<p>Now it was near dinner-time, and he
hadn't even got the butter yet; so he
thought he'd best boil the porridge, and
filled the pot with water and hung it
over the fire. When he had done that,
he thought the cow might perhaps fall
off the thatch and break her legs or her
neck. So he got up on the house to
tie her up. One end of the rope he made
fast to the cow's neck, and the other he
slipped down the chimney and tied
round his own thigh; and he had to
make haste, for the water now began to
boil in the pot, and he had still to grind
the oatmeal.</p>

<p>So he began to grind away; but while
he was hard at it, down fell the cow off
the house-top after all, and as she fell,
she dragged the man up the chimney by
the rope. There he stuck fast; and as
for the cow, she hung half way down the
wall, swinging between heaven and earth,
for she could neither get down nor up.</p>

<p>And now the goody had waited seven
lengths and seven breadths for her husband
to come and call them home to
dinner; but never a call they had. At
last she thought she'd waited long
enough, and went home. But when she
got there and saw the cow hanging in
such an ugly place, she ran up and cut
the rope in two with her scythe. But
as she did this, down came her husband
out of the chimney; and so when his
old dame came inside the kitchen, there
she found him standing on his head in
the porridge pot.</p>

<div class="hang1">The artistic qualities of "Boots and His
Brothers," from Dasent's <i>Popular Tales
from the Norse</i>, will impress every reader or
listener. It belongs to that very numerous
group of stories dealing with the success
of the youngest child in the face of opposition,
mistreatment, or lack of sympathy
from others of his family. "John was
Boots, of course, because he was the
youngest"; which means that it was the
rule to give the most menial tasks about the
house to the youngest. But John had the
saving trait of always "wondering" about
things, which led him to find out what
would always be hidden from his more
stupid and less imaginative brothers.</div>


<h4><br />BOOTS AND HIS BROTHERS</h4>

<p>Once on a time there was a man who
had three sons, Peter, Paul, and John.
John was Boots, of course, because he
was the youngest. I can't say the man
had anything more than these three sons,
for he hadn't one penny to rub against
another; and so he told his sons over
and over again they must go out into
the world and try to earn their bread,
for there at home there was nothing
to be looked for but starving to death.</p>

<p>Now, a bit off the man's cottage was
the King's palace, and you must know,
just against the King's windows a great
oak had sprung up, which was so stout
and big that it took away all the light
from the King's palace. The King had
said he would give many, many dollars
to the man who could fell the oak, but
no one was man enough for that, for as
soon as ever one chip of the oak's trunk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
flew off, two grew in its stead. A well,
too, the King would have dug, which was
to hold water for the whole year; for all
his neighbors had wells, but he hadn't
any, and that he thought a shame. So
the King said he would give any one
who could dig him such a well as would
hold water for a whole year round, both
money and goods; but no one could do
it, for the King's palace lay high, high
up on a hill, and they hadn't dug a few
inches before they came upon the living
rock.</p>

<p>But as the King had set his heart on
having these two things done, he had
it given out far and wide, in all the
churches of his kingdom, that he who
could fell the big oak in the king's
court-yard, and get him a well that would
hold water the whole year round, should
have the Princess and half the kingdom.
Well! you may easily know there was
many a man who came to try his luck;
but for all their hacking and hewing, and
all their digging and delving, it was no
good. The oak got bigger and stouter
at every stroke, and the rock didn't get
softer either. So one day those three
brothers thought they'd set off and try
too, and their father hadn't a word
against it; for even if they didn't get
the Princess and half the kingdom, it
might happen they might get a place
somewhere with a good master; and
that was all he wanted. So when the
brothers said they thought of going to
the palace, their father said "yes" at
once. So Peter, Paul, and Jack went
off from their home.</p>

<p>Well! they hadn't gone far before
they came to a fir wood, and up along
one side of it rose a steep hillside, and
as they went, they heard something
hewing and hacking away up on the hill
among the trees.</p>

<p>"I wonder now what it is that is
hewing away up yonder?" said Jack.</p>

<p>"You're always so clever with your
wonderings," said Peter and Paul both
at once. "What wonder is it, pray,
that a woodcutter should stand and
hack up on a hillside?"</p>

<p>"Still, I'd like to see what it is, after
all," said Jack; and up he went.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you're such a child, 'twill do
you good to go and take a lesson,"
bawled out his brothers after him.</p>

<p>But Jack didn't care for what they
said; he climbed the steep hillside
towards where the noise came, and when
he reached the place, what do you think
he saw? Why, an axe that stood there
hacking and hewing, all of itself, at the
trunk of a fir.</p>

<p>"Good day!" said Jack. "So you
stand here all alone and hew, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; here I've stood and hewed and
hacked a long, long time, waiting for
you," said the Axe.</p>

<p>"Well, here I am at last," said Jack,
as he took the axe, pulled it off its haft,
and stuffed both head and haft into his
wallet.</p>

<p>So when he got down again to his
brothers, they began to jeer and laugh
at him.</p>

<p>"And now, what funny thing was it
you saw up yonder on the hillside?"
they said.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was only an axe we heard,"
said Jack.</p>

<p>So when they had gone a bit farther,
they came under a steep spur of rock,
and up there they heard something digging
and shoveling.</p>

<p>"I wonder now," said Jack, "what it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
is digging and shoveling up yonder at
the top of the rock!"</p>

<p>"Ah, you're always so clever with
your wonderings," said Peter and Paul
again, "as if you'd never heard a woodpecker
hacking and pecking at a hollow
tree."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Jack, "I think it
would be a piece of fun just to see what
it really is."</p>

<p>And so off he set to climb the rock,
while the others laughed and made game
of him. But he didn't care a bit for
that; up he climbed, and when he got
near the top, what do you think he saw?
Why, a spade that stood there digging
and delving.</p>

<p>"Good day!" said Jack. "So you
stand here all alone, and dig and delve!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I do," said the
Spade, "and that's what I've done this
many a long day, waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Well, here I am," said Jack again,
as he took the spade and knocked it
off its handle, and put it into his wallet,
and then down again to his brothers.</p>

<p>"Well, what was it, so rare and
strange," said Peter and Paul, "that
you saw up there at the top of the
rock?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Jack, "nothing more than
a spade; that was what we heard."</p>

<p>So they went on again a good bit, till
they came to a brook. They were
thirsty, all three, after their long walk,
and so they lay down beside the brook
to have a drink.</p>

<p>"I wonder now," said Jack, "where all
this water comes from!"</p>

<p>"I wonder if you're right in your
head," said Peter and Paul, in one
breath. "If you're not mad already,
you'll go mad very soon, with your
wonderings. Where the brook comes
from, indeed! Have you never heard
how water rises from a spring in the
earth?"</p>

<p>"Yes! but still I've a great fancy to
see where this brook comes from," said
Jack.</p>

<p>So up alongside the brook he went,
in spite of all that his brothers bawled
after him. Nothing could stop him.
On he went. So, as he went up and up,
the brook got smaller and smaller, and
at last, a little way farther on, what do
you think he saw? Why, a great walnut,
and out of that the water trickled.</p>

<p>"Good day!" said Jack again. "So
you lie here, and trickle and run down
all alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said the Walnut, "and
here have I trickled and run this many
a long day, waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Well, here I am," said Jack, as he
took up a lump of moss, and plugged
up the hole, that the water mightn't
run out. Then he put the walnut into
his wallet, and ran down to his brothers.</p>

<p>"Well, now," said Peter and Paul, "have
you found out where the water comes
from? A rare sight it must have been!"</p>

<p>"Oh, after all, it was only a hole it
ran out of," said Jack; and so the others
laughed and made game of him again,
but Jack didn't mind that a bit.</p>

<p>"After all, I had the fun of seeing it,"
said he.</p>

<p>So when they had gone a bit farther,
they came to the King's palace; but
as every one in the kingdom had heard
how they might win the Princess and
half the realm, if they could only fell
the big oak and dig the King's well, so
many had come to try their luck that
the oak was now twice as stout and big
as it had been at first, for two chips
grew for every one they hewed out with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
their axes, as I dare say you all bear in
mind. So the King had now laid it
down as a punishment, that if any one
tried and couldn't fell the oak, he should
be put on a barren island, and both his
ears were to be clipped off. But the
two brothers didn't let themselves be
scared by that; they were quite sure
they could fell the oak, and Peter, as
he was eldest, was to try his hand first;
but it went with him as with all the rest
who had hewn at the oak; for every
chip he cut out, two grew in its place.
So the King's men seized him, and
clipped off both his ears, and put him
out on the island.</p>

<p>Now Paul, he was to try his luck, but
he fared just the same; when he had
hewn two or three strokes, they began
to see the oak grow, and so the King's
men seized him too, and clipped his ears,
and put him out on the island; and his
ears they clipped closer, because they
said he ought to have taken a lesson from
his brother.</p>

<p>So now Jack was to try.</p>

<p>"If you <i>will</i> look like a marked sheep,
we're quite ready to clip your ears at
once, and then you'll save yourself some
bother," said the King, for he was
angry with him for his brothers' sake.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like just to try first," said
Jack, and so he got leave. Then he
took his axe out of his wallet and fitted
it to its haft.</p>

<p>"Hew away!" said he to his axe; and
away it hewed, making the chips fly
again, so that it wasn't long before
down came the oak.</p>

<p>When that was done, Jack pulled out
his spade, and fitted it to its handle.</p>

<p>"Dig away!" said he to the spade;
and so the spade began to dig and delve
till the earth and rock flew out in splinters,
and so he had the well soon dug
out, you may think.</p>

<p>And when he had got it as big and
deep as he chose, Jack took out his
walnut and laid it in one corner of
the well, and pulled the plug of moss
out.</p>

<p>"Trickle and run," said Jack; and so
the nut trickled and ran, till the water
gushed out of the hole in a stream, and
in a short time the well was brimful.</p>

<p>Then Jack had felled the oak which
shaded the King's palace, and dug a well
in the palace-yard, and so he got the
Princess and half the kingdom, as the
King had said; but it was lucky for
Peter and Paul that they had lost their
ears, else they had heard each hour and
day how every one said, "Well, after
all, Jack wasn't so much out of his
mind when he took to wondering."</p>

the evil place would be associated with
intense cold. Of more importance, however,
is the fact that the magic quern brings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
not good but disaster to those who try to
use it in the service of greed.</div>


<h4><br />THE QUERN AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE SEA</h4>

<p>Once upon a time in the old, old days
there were two brothers, one of whom
was rich and the other poor. When
Christmas Eve came the poor brother
had not a morsel in the house, neither
of meat nor bread; and so he went to
his rich brother and asked for a trifle
for Christmas, in heaven's name. It
was not the first time the brother had
helped him, but he was always very
close-fisted, and was not particularly
glad to see him this time.</p>

<p>"If you'll do what I tell you, you
shall have a whole ham," he said. The
poor brother promised he would, and
was very grateful into the bargain.</p>

<p>"There it is, and now go to the devil!"
said the rich brother, and threw the
ham across to him.</p>

<p>"Well, what I have promised I must
keep," said the other one. He took the
ham, and set out. He walked and
walked the whole day, and as it was
getting dark he came to a place where
the lights were shining brightly. "This
is most likely the place," thought the
man with the ham.</p>

<p>In the woodshed stood an old man
with a long white beard, cutting fire-wood
for Christmas.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said he with the ham.</p>

<p>"Good evening to you," said the man.
"Where are you going so late?"</p>

<p>"I am going to the devil&mdash;that is to
say, if I am on the right way," answered
the poor man.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are quite right; this is his
place," said the old man. "When you
get in, they will all want to buy your
ham, for ham is scarce food here; but
you must not sell it unless you get the
hand-quern, which stands just behind
the door. When you come out again,
I'll teach you how to use it. You will
find it useful in many ways."</p>

<p>The man with the ham thanked him
for all the information, and knocked at
the door.</p>

<p>When he got in, it happened just as the
old man had said. All the imps, both
big and small, flocked around him like
ants in a field, and the one outbid the
other for the ham.</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, "my good
woman and I were to have it for Christmas
Eve, but since you want it so badly
I will let you have it. But if I am going
to part with it, I want that hand-quern
which stands behind the door."</p>

<p>The devil did not like to part with it,
and higgled and haggled with the man, but
he stuck to what he had said, and in the
end the devil had to part with the quern.</p>

<p>When the man came out, he asked the
old wood-cutter how he was to use the
quern, and when he had learned this, he
thanked the old man and set out homewards
as quickly as he could; but after
all he did not get home till the clock
struck twelve on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>"Where in all the world have you
been?" said his wife. "Here have I
been sitting, hour after hour, waiting
and watching for you, and have not had
as much as two chips to lay under the
porridge pot."</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't get back before,"
said the man. "I have had a good
many things to look after, and I've had
a long way to walk as well; but now
I'll show you something," said he, and
put the quern on the table. He asked
it first to grind candles, then a cloth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and then food and beer, and everything
else that was good for Christmas cheer;
and as he spoke the quern brought them
forth. The woman crossed herself time
after time and wanted to know where
her husband had got the quern from;
but this he would not tell her.</p>

<p>"It does not matter where I got it
from; you see the quern is good and the
mill stream is not likely to freeze," said
the man. So he ground food and drink
and all good things during Christmas;
and the third day he invited his friends,
as he wanted to give them a feast.
When the rich brother saw all that was
in the house, he became both angry
and furious, for he begrudged his brother
everything.</p>

<p>"On Christmas Eve he was so needy
that he came to me and asked for a
trifle in heaven's name; and now he
gives a feast, as if he were both a count
and a king," said the brother. "Where
did you get all your riches from?" he
said to his brother.</p>

<p>"From just behind the door," he
answered, for he did not care to tell
his brother much about it. But later
in the evening, when he had drunk a
little freely, he could no longer resist,
but brought out the quern.</p>

<p>"There you see that which has brought
me all my riches," he said, and so he
let the quern grind first one thing and
then another.</p>

<p>When the brother saw this, he was
determined to have the quern at all cost,
and at last it was settled he should have
it, but three hundred dollars was to be
the price of it. The brother was, however,
to keep it till the harvest began;
"for if I keep it so long, I can grind out
food for many years to come," he thought.</p>

<p>During that time you may be sure
the quern did not rust, and when the
harvest began the rich brother got it;
but the other had taken great care not
to show him how to use it.</p>

<p>It was evening when the rich brother
got the quern home, and in the morning
he asked his wife to go out and help the
haymakers; he would get the breakfast
ready himself to-day, he said.</p>

<p>When it was near breakfast time he
put the quern on the breakfast table.</p>

<p>"Grind herrings and broth, and do it
quickly and well," said the man, and
the quern began to bring forth herrings
and broth, and filled first all the dishes
and tubs, and afterwards began flooding
the whole kitchen.</p>

<p>The man fiddled and fumbled and tried
to stop the quern, but however much he
twisted and fingered it, the quern went
on grinding, and in a little while the
broth reached so high that the man was
very near drowning. He then pulled
open the parlor door, but it was not
long before the quern had filled the
parlor also, and it was just in the very
nick of time that the man put his hand
down into the broth and got hold of the
latch, and when he had got the door
open, he was soon out of the parlor,
you may be sure. He rushed out, and
the herrings and the broth came pouring
out after him, like a stream, down
the fields and meadows.</p>

<p>The wife, who was out haymaking,
now thought it took too long a time to
get the breakfast ready.</p>

<p>"If my husband doesn't call us soon,
we must go home whether or no: I
don't suppose he knows much about making
broth, so I must go and help
him," said the wife to the haymakers.</p>

<p>They began walking homewards, but
when they had got a bit up the hill they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
met the stream of broth with the herrings
tossing about in it and the man
himself running in front of it all.</p>

<p>"I wish all of you had a hundred
stomachs each!" shouted the man; "but
take care you don't get drowned." And
he rushed past them as if the Evil One
was at his heels, down to where his
brother lived. He asked him for heaven's
sake to take back the quern, and
that at once. "If it goes on grinding
another hour the whole parish will perish
in broth and herrings," he said. But
the brother would not take it back on
any account before his brother had paid
him three hundred dollars more, and
this he had to do. The poor brother
now had plenty of money, and before
long he bought a farm much grander
than the one on which his rich brother
lived, and with the quern he ground so
much gold that he covered the farmstead
with gold plates and, as it lay
close to the shore, it glittered and shone
far out at sea. All those who sailed
past wanted to call and visit the rich
man in the golden house, and everybody
wanted to see the wonderful quern,
for its fame had spread both far and
wide, and there was no one who had
not heard it spoken of.</p>

<p>After a long while there came a skipper
who wanted to see the quern; he
asked if it could grind salt. Yes, that
it could, said he who owned it; and
when the skipper heard this he wanted
the quern by hook or by crook, cost
what it might, for if he had it he thought
he need not sail far away across dangerous
seas for cargoes of salt.</p>

<p>At first the man did not want to part
with it, but the skipper both begged and
prayed, and at last he sold it and got
many, many thousand dollars for it.</p>

<p>As soon as the skipper had got the
quern on his back he did not stop long,
for he was afraid the man would change
his mind, and as for asking how to use
it, he had no time to do that; he made
for his ship as quickly as he could, and
when he had got out to sea a bit he had
the quern brought up on deck.</p>

<p>"Grind salt, and that both quickly
and well," said the skipper, and the
quern began to grind out salt so that it
spurted to all sides.</p>

<p>When the skipper had got the ship
filled he wanted to stop the quern, but
however much he tried and whatever
he did the quern went on grinding, and
the mound of salt grew higher and
higher, and at last the ship sank.</p>

<p>There at the bottom of the sea stands
the quern grinding till this very day, and
that is the reason why the sea is salt.</p>

<div class="hang1">The next seven stories are from the best
known of all collections of folk tales, the
<i>Kinder und Hausm&auml;rchen</i> (1812-1815) of
the brothers Jacob Grimm (1785-1863)
and Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859). They
worked together as scholarly investigators
in the field of philology. The world is
indebted to them for the creation of the
science of folklore. Other writers, such as
Perrault, had published collections of folklore,
but these two brothers were the first
to collect, classify, and publish folk tales in
a scientific way. With the trained judgment
of scholars they excluded from the
stories all details that seemed new or foreign,
and put them as nearly as possible
into the form in which they had been told
by the folk. These <i>Household Tales</i> were
first made accessible in English in the
translation of Edgar Taylor, published in
two volumes in 1823 and 1826, and revised
in 1837. There have been later translations,
notably the complete one by Margaret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Hunt in 1884, but the Taylor version has
been the main source of the popular
retellings for nearly a hundred years. It
included only about fifty of the two hundred
tales, and was illustrated by the
famous artist George Cruikshank. An
edition including all the Taylor translations
and the original etchings was issued in
1868 with an introduction by John Ruskin.
It is still reprinted under the title, <i>Grimm's
Popular Stories</i>.<br />
<br />
"The Traveling Musicians" is from the Taylor
translation. It is sometimes called
"The Bremen Town Musicians," or simply
"The Town Musicians." The story
is widespread, showing its great popularity.
Jacobs finds "the fullest and most dramatic
form" in the Irish "Jack and His
Comrades," which he includes in his <i>Celtic
Fairy Tales</i>. Jacobs also gives an English
version by way of America, "How Jack
Sought His Fortune," in his <i>English
Fairy Tales</i>. The successful outcome for
these distressed and deserving poor adventurers
appeals as a fine stroke of poetic
justice.</div>


<h4><br />THE TRAVELING MUSICIANS</h4>

<p>An honest farmer had once an ass that
had been a faithful servant to him a
great many years, but was now growing
old and every day more and more unfit
for work. His master therefore was tired
of keeping him and began to think of
putting an end to him; but the ass, who
saw that some mischief was in the wind,
took himself slyly off and began his journey
towards the great city, "for there,"
thought he, "I may turn musician."</p>

<p>After he had traveled a little way, he
spied a dog lying by the road-side and
panting as if he were very tired. "What
makes you pant so, my friend?" said the
ass.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the dog, "my master was
going to knock me on the head because I
am old and weak and can no longer make
myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran
away: but what can I do to earn my livelihood?"</p>

<p>"Hark ye!" said the ass, "I am going
to the great city to turn musician: suppose
you go with me and try what you
can do in the same way?" The dog said
he was willing, and they jogged on
together.</p>

<p>Before they had gone far, they saw a
cat sitting in the middle of the road and
making a most rueful face. "Pray, my
good lady," said the ass, "what's the
matter with you? You look quite out of
spirits!"</p>

<p>"Ah, me!" said the cat, "how can one
be in good spirits when one's life is in
danger? Because I am beginning to
grow old and had rather lie at my ease
by the fire than run about the house after
the mice, my mistress laid hold of me
and was going to drown me; and though
I have been lucky enough to get away
from her, I do not know what I am to
live upon."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the ass, "by all means go
with us to the great city. You are a good
night-singer and may make your fortune
as a musician." The cat was pleased
with the thought and joined the party.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, as they were passing
by a farmyard, they saw a cock perched
upon a gate, screaming out with all his
might and main. "Bravo!" said the
ass; "upon my word you make a famous
noise; pray what is all this about?"</p>

<p>"Why," said the cock, "I was just now
saying that we should have fine weather
for our washing-day, and yet my mistress
and the cook don't thank me for my
pains, but threaten to cut off my head
tomorrow and make broth of me for the
guests that are coming on Sunday."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" said the ass; "come
with us, Master Chanticleer; it will be
better, at any rate, than staying here to
have your head cut off! Besides, who
knows? If we take care to sing in tune,
we may get up some kind of a concert:
so come along with us."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," said the cock: so
they all four went on jollily together.</p>

<p>They could not, however, reach the
great city the first day: so when night
came on they went into a wood to sleep.
The ass and the dog laid themselves down
under a great tree, and the cat climbed
up into the branches; while the cock,
thinking that the higher he sat the safer
he should be, flew up to the very top of
the tree, and then, according to his custom,
before he went to sleep, looked out
on all sides of him to see that everything
was well. In doing this, he saw afar
off something bright and shining; and
calling to his companions said, "There
must be a house no great way off, for I
see a light."</p>

<p>"If that be the case," said the ass, "we
had better change our quarters, for our
lodging is not the best in the world!"</p>

<p>"Besides," added the dog, "I should
not be the worse for a bone or two, or a
bit of meat." So they walked off together
towards the spot where Chanticleer
had seen the light; and as they
drew near, it became larger and brighter,
till they at last came close to a house in
which a gang of robbers lived.</p>

<p>The ass, being the tallest of the company,
marched up to the window and
peeped in. "Well, Donkey," said Chanticleer,
"what do you see?"</p>

<p>"What do I see?" replied the ass,
"why I see a table spread with all kinds
of good things, and robbers sitting round
it making merry."</p>

<p>"That would be a noble lodging for
us," said the cock.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the ass, "if we could only
get in": so they consulted together how
they should contrive to get the robbers
out; and at last they hit upon a plan.
The ass placed himself upright on
his hind-legs, with his fore-feet resting
against the window; the dog got upon his
back; the cat scrambled up to the dog's
shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat
upon the cat's head. When all was
ready, a signal was given, and they began
their music. The ass brayed, the dog
barked, the cat mewed, and the cock
screamed; and then they all broke
through the window at once and came
tumbling into the room, amongst the
broken glass, with a most hideous clatter!
The robbers, who had been not a little
frightened by the opening concert, had
now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin
had broken in upon them, and
scampered away as fast as they could.</p>

<p>The coast once clear, our travelers
soon sat down and dispatched what the
robbers had left, with as much eagerness
as if they had not expected to eat again
for a month. As soon as they had satisfied
themselves, they put out the lights
and each once more sought out a resting-place
to his own liking. The donkey laid
himself down upon a heap of straw in the
yard; the dog stretched himself upon a mat
behind the door; the cat rolled herself up
on the hearth before the warm ashes; and
the cock perched upon a beam on the top of
the house; and, as they were all rather tired
with their journey, they soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>But about midnight, when the robbers
saw from afar that the lights were out
and that all seemed quiet, they began to
think that they had been in too great a
hurry to run away; and one of them, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
was bolder than the rest, went to see what
was going on. Finding everything still,
he marched into the kitchen and groped
about till he found a match in order to
light a candle; and then, espying the
glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he mistook
them for live coals and held the match
to them to light it. But the cat, not
understanding this joke, sprung at his
face, and spit, and scratched at him.
This frightened him dreadfully, and away
he ran to the back door; but there the
dog jumped up and bit him in the leg;
and as he was crossing over the yard the
ass kicked him; and the cock, who had
been awakened by the noise, crowed with
all his might. At this the robber ran
back as fast as he could to his comrades
and told the captain "how a horrid witch
had got into the house, and had spit at
him and scratched his face with her long
bony fingers; how a man with a knife in
his hand had hidden himself behind the
door and stabbed him in the leg; how a
black monster stood in the yard and
struck him with a club, and how the
devil sat upon the top of the house and
cried out, 'Throw the rascal up here!'"</p>

<p>After this the robbers never dared to go
back to the house; but the musicians
were so pleased with their quarters that
they took up their abode there; and there
they are, I dare say, at this very day.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_174" id="Note_174">174</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The Taylor translation of Grimm is used for
"The Blue Light." This tale contains
several of the elements most popular in
children's stories. There is merit in distress,
an old witch, the magic blue light,
the little black dwarf, and the exceeding
great reward at the end. From this very
story or some variant of it Hans Christian
Andersen must have drawn the inspiration
for "The Tinder Box" (No. <a href="#Note_196">196</a>).</div>


<h4><br />THE BLUE LIGHT</h4>

<p>A soldier had served a king his master
many years, till at last he was turned off
without pay or reward. How he should
get his living he did not know; so he set
out and journeyed homeward all day in a
very downcast mood, until in the evening
he came to the edge of a deep wood.
The road leading that way, he pushed
forward; but before he had gone far, he
saw a light glimmering through the trees,
towards which he bent his weary steps;
and soon he came to a hut where no one
lived but an old witch. The poor fellow
begged for a night's lodging and something
to eat and drink; but she would
listen to nothing. However, he was not
easily got rid of; and at last she said, "I
think I will take pity on you this once;
but if I do, you must dig over all my garden
for me in the morning." The soldier
agreed very willingly to anything she
asked, and he became her guest.</p>

<p>The next day he kept his word and dug
the garden very neatly. The job lasted
all day; and in the evening, when his mistress
would have sent him away, he said,
"I am so tired with my work that I must
beg you to let me stay over the night."</p>

<p>The old lady vowed at first she would
not do any such thing; but after a great
deal of talk he carried his point, agreeing
to chop up a whole cart-load of wood for
her the next day.</p>

<p>This task too was duly ended; but not
till towards night, and then he found himself
so tired that he begged a third night's
rest; and this too was given, but only on
his pledging his word that he next day
would fetch the witch the blue light that
burnt at the bottom of the well.</p>

<p>When morning came she led him to the
well's mouth, tied him to a long rope, and
let him down. At the bottom sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
enough he found the blue light as the
witch had said, and at once made the
signal for her to draw him up again.
But when she had pulled him up so near
to the top that she could reach him with
her hands, she said, "Give me the light:
I will take care of it,"&mdash;meaning to play
him a trick by taking it for herself and
letting him fall again to the bottom of
the well.</p>

<p>But the soldier saw through her wicked
thoughts, and said, "No, I shall not give
you the light till I find myself safe and
sound out of the well."</p>

<p>At this she became very angry and
dashed him, with the light she had longed
for many a year, down to the bottom.
And there lay the poor soldier for a while
in despair, on the damp mud below, and
feared that his end was nigh. But his
pipe happened to be in his pocket still
half full, and he thought to himself, "I
may as well make an end of smoking you
out; it is the last pleasure I shall have in
this world." So he lit it at the blue
light and began to smoke.</p>

<p>Up rose a cloud of smoke, and on a
sudden a little black dwarf was seen
making his way through the midst of it.
"What do you want with me, soldier?"
said he.</p>

<p>"I have no business with you,"
answered he.</p>

<p>But the dwarf said, "I am bound to
serve you in every thing, as lord and
master of the blue light."</p>

<p>"Then first of all, be so good as to help
me out of this well." No sooner said
than done: the dwarf took him by the
hand and drew him up, and the blue light
of course with him. "Now do me
another piece of kindness," said the soldier:
"pray let that old lady take my
place in the well."</p>

<p>When the dwarf had done this, and
lodged the witch safely at the bottom,
they began to ransack her treasures; and
the soldier made bold to carry off as
much of her gold and silver as he well
could. Then the dwarf said, "If you
should chance at any time to want me,
you have nothing to do but to light your
pipe at the blue light, and I will soon be
with you."</p>

<p>The soldier was not a little pleased at
his good luck, and went to the best inn
in the first town he came to and ordered
some fine clothes to be made and a handsome
room to be got ready for him.
When all was ready, he called his little
man to him and said, "The king sent me
away penniless and left me to hunger and
want. I have a mind to show him that
it is my turn to be master now; so bring
me his daughter here this evening, that
she may wait upon me and do what I bid
her."</p>

<p>"That is rather a dangerous task," said
the dwarf. But away he went, took
the princess out of her bed, fast asleep
as she was, and brought her to the
soldier.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning he carried
her back; and as soon as she saw her
father, she said, "I had a strange dream
last night. I thought I was carried away
through the air to a soldier's house, and
there I waited upon him as his servant."
Then the king wondered greatly at such
a story; but told her to make a hole in
her pocket and fill it with peas, so that
if it were really as she said, and the whole
was not a dream, the peas might fall out
in the streets as she passed through, and
leave a clue to tell whither she had been
taken. She did so; but the dwarf had
heard the king's plot; and when evening
came, and the soldier said he must bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
him the princess again, he strewed peas
over several of the streets, so that the
few that fell from her pocket were not
known from the others; and the people
amused themselves all the next day picking
up peas and wondering where so
many came from.</p>

<p>When the princess told her father what
had happened to her the second time, he
said, "Take one of your shoes with you
and hide it in the room you are taken to."</p>

<p>The dwarf heard this also; and when
the soldier told him to bring the king's
daughter again, he said, "I cannot save
you this time; it will be an unlucky thing
for you if you are found out&mdash;as I think
you will." But the soldier would have
his own way. "Then you must take
care and make the best of your way out
of the city gate very early in the morning,"
said the dwarf.</p>

<p>The princess kept one shoe on as her
father bid her, and hid it in the soldier's
room; and when she got back to her
father, he ordered it to be sought for all
over the town; and at last it was found
where she had hid it. The soldier had
run away, it is true; but he had been too
slow and was soon caught and thrown
into a strong prison and loaded with
chains. What was worse, in the hurry of
his flight, he had left behind him his great
treasure, the blue light, and all his gold,
and had nothing left in his pocket but
one poor ducat.</p>

<p>As he was standing very sorrowful at
the prison grating, he saw one of his comrades,
and calling out to him said, "If
you will bring me a little bundle I left
in the inn, I will give you a ducat."</p>

<p>His comrade thought this very good
pay for such a job; so he went away and
soon came back bringing the blue light
and the gold. Then the prisoner soon
lit his pipe. Up rose the smoke, and with
it came his old friend, the little dwarf.
"Do not fear, master," said he: "keep
up your heart at your trial and leave
everything to take its course;&mdash;only
mind to take the blue light with you."</p>

<p>The trial soon came on; the matter
was sifted to the bottom; the prisoner
found guilty, and his doom passed:&mdash;he
was ordered to be hanged forthwith on the
gallows-tree.</p>

<p>But as he was led out, he said he had
one favor to beg of the king. "What is
it?" said his majesty.</p>

<p>"That you will deign to let me smoke
one pipe on the road."</p>

<p>"Two, if you like," said the king.</p>

<p>Then he lit his pipe at the blue light,
and the black dwarf was before him in a
moment. "Be so good as to kill, slay,
or put to flight all these people," said the
soldier: "and as for the king, you may
cut him into three pieces."</p>

<p>Then the dwarf began to lay about
him, and soon got rid of the crowd
around: but the king begged hard for
mercy; and, to save his life, agreed to let
the soldier have the princess for his wife
and to leave the kingdom to him when he
died.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_175" id="Note_175">175</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The following tale is from Taylor's translation
of Grimm. The cheerful industry and the
kindly gratitude of the shoemaker and his
wife, together with the gayety of the little
elves, make the story altogether charming.
No doubt its popularity was helped by
Cruikshank's famous accompanying etching,
showing the scene at the close, in which
the two elves "are drawn with a point
at once so precise and vivacious, so full of
keen fun and inimitably happy invention,
that I have not found their equal in comic
etching anywhere.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The picturesque<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
details of the room are etched with the same
felicitous intelligence; but the marvel of
the work is in the expression of the strange
little faces, and the energy of the comical
wee limbs." (Hamerton, <i>Etching and
Etchers</i>.)</div>


<h4><br />THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER</h4>

<p>There was once a shoemaker who
worked very hard and was very honest;
but still he could not earn enough to
live upon, and at last all he had in the
world was gone, except just leather
enough to make one pair of shoes. Then
he cut them all ready to make up the
next day, meaning to get up early in
the morning to work. His conscience
was clear and his heart light amidst all
his troubles; so he went peaceably to
bed, left all his cares to heaven, and fell
asleep. In the morning, after he had
said his prayers, he set himself down to
his work, but to his great wonder, there
stood the shoes, all ready made, upon
the table. The good man knew not
what to say or think of this strange
event. He looked at the workmanship:
there was not one false stitch in the whole
job, and all was so neat and true that
it was a complete masterpiece.</p>

<p>That same day a customer came in,
and the shoes pleased him so well that
he willingly paid a price higher than
usual for them; and the poor shoemaker
with the money bought leather enough
to make two pairs more. In the evening
he cut out the work and went to
bed early that he might get up and begin
betimes next day: but he was saved all
the trouble, for when he got up in the
morning the work was finished ready to
his hand. Presently in came buyers,
who paid him handsomely for his goods,
so that he bought leather enough for
four pairs more. He cut out the work
again over night, and found it finished
in the morning as before; and so it went
on for some time: what was got ready in
the evening was always done by daybreak,
and the good man soon became
thriving and prosperous again.</p>

<p>One evening about Christmas time, as
he and his wife were sitting over the
fire chatting together, he said to her,
"I should like to sit up and watch
to-night, that we may see who it is that
comes and does my work for me." The
wife liked the thought; so they left a
light burning and hid themselves in the
corner of the room behind a curtain that
was hung up there, and watched what
should happen.</p>

<p>As soon as it was midnight, there came
two little naked dwarfs; and they sat
themselves upon the shoemaker's bench,
took up all the work that was cut out,
and began to ply with their little fingers,
stitching and rapping and tapping away
at such a rate that the shoemaker was
all amazement and could not take his
eyes off for a moment. And on they
went till the job was quite finished, and
the shoes stood ready for use upon the
table. This was long before daybreak;
and then they bustled away as quick as
lightning.</p>

<p>The next day the wife said to the
shoemaker, "These little wights have
made us rich, and we ought to be thankful
to them and do them a good office
in return. I am quite vexed to see them
run about as they do; they have nothing
upon their backs to keep off the cold.
I'll tell you what, I will make each of
them a shirt, and a coat and waistcoat,
and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain;
do you make each of them a little pair
of shoes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>The thought pleased the good shoemaker
very much; and one evening,
when all the things were ready, they
laid them on the table instead of the
work that they used to cut out, and
then went and hid themselves to watch
what the little elves would do. About
midnight they came in and were going
to sit down to their work as usual; but
when they saw the clothes lying for
them, they laughed and were greatly
delighted. Then they dressed themselves
in the twinkling of an eye, and
danced and capered and sprang about
as merry as could be, till at last they
danced out at the door and over the
green; and the shoemaker saw them no
more; but everything went well with
him from that time forward, as long as
he lived.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_176" id="Note_176">176</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">In a note regarding "The Fisherman and His
Wife," Taylor calls attention to the interesting
fact that this tale became a great
favorite after the battle of Waterloo "during
the fervor of popular feeling on the
downfall of the late Emperor of France."
The catastrophe attendant upon Napoleon's
ambitious efforts seemed to the popular
mind to be paralleled by the penalty
following the final wish of the wife "to be
like unto God." But observe that Taylor,
unlike more recent translators, felt under
the necessity of softening "the boldness of
the lady's ambition." The versions of the
verse charm used in summoning the fish
differ strikingly in the various translations.
That of Taylor's first edition, used here,
seems to fit the story better than any other,
though tellers of the story may, properly
enough, not agree. Taylor's revised version
of 1837 reads:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"O man of the sea!<br />
Hearken to me!<br />
My wife Ilsabill<br />
Will have her own will,<br />
And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"<br />
</div>

<p>Mrs. Hunt's version runs:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Flounder, flounder in the sea,<br />
Come, I pray thee, come to me;<br />
For my wife, good Ilsabil,<br />
Wills not as I'd have her will."<br />
</div>

<div class='hang1'><br />The moral of the story is plain for those
who need it: Greed overreaches itself.
Who grasps too much loses all. Don't
ride a free horse to death.</div>


<h4><br />THE FISHERMAN AND HIS
WIFE</h4>

<p>There was once a fisherman who lived
with his wife in a ditch, close by the
sea-side. The fisherman used to go out
all day long a-fishing; and one day, as
he sat on the shore with his rod, looking
at the shining water and watching his
line, all on a sudden his float was dragged
away deep under the sea: and in drawing
it up he pulled a great fish out of the
water. The fish said to him, "Pray let
me live: I am not a real fish; I am an
enchanted prince. Put me in the water
again, and let me go."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the man, "you need not
make so many words about the matter.
I wish to have nothing to do with a fish
that can talk; so swim away as soon as
you please." Then he put him back
into the water, and the fish darted
straight down to the bottom and left a
long streak of blood behind him.</p>

<p>When the fisherman went home to his
wife in the ditch, he told her how he had
caught a great fish, and how it had told
him it was an enchanted prince, and that
on hearing it speak he had let it go again.</p>

<p>"Did you not ask it for anything?"
said the wife.</p>

<p>"No," said the man, "what should I
ask for?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the wife, "we live very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
wretchedly here in this nasty stinking
ditch. Do go back, and tell the fish we
want a little cottage."</p>

<p>The fisherman did not much like the
business; however he went to the sea,
and when he came there the water looked
all yellow and green. And he stood at
the water's edge, and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O man of the sea!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come listen to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Alice my wife,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The plague of my life,</span><br />
Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"<br />
</div>

<p>Then the fish came swimming to him,
and said, "Well, what does she want?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" answered the fisherman, "my
wife says that when I had caught you, I
ought to have asked you for something
before I let you go again. She does not
like living any longer in the ditch, and
wants a little cottage."</p>

<p>"Go home, then," said the fish. "She
is in the cottage already."</p>

<p>So the man went home and saw his
wife standing at the door of a cottage.
"Come in, come in," said she; "is not
this much better than the ditch?" And
there was a parlor, and a bed-chamber,
and a kitchen; and behind the cottage
there was a little garden with all sorts
of flowers and fruits, and a court-yard
full of ducks and chickens.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the fisherman, "how happily
we shall live!"</p>

<p>"We will try to do so at least," said
his wife.</p>

<p>Everything went right for a week or
two, and then Dame Alice said, "Husband,
there is not room enough in this
cottage; the court-yard and garden are
a great deal too small. I should like to
have a large stone castle to live in; so
go to the fish again, and tell him to give
us a castle."</p>

<p>"Wife," said the fisherman, "I don't
like to go to him again, for perhaps he
will be angry. We ought to be content
with the cottage."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the wife; "he will
do it very willingly. Go along, and try."</p>

<p>The fisherman went; but his heart
was very heavy: and when he came to
the sea, it looked blue and gloomy,
though it was quite calm, and he went
close to it and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O man of the sea!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come listen to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Alice my wife,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The plague of my life,</span><br />
Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"<br />
</div>

<p>"Well, what does she want now?"
said the fish.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the man very sorrowfully,
"my wife wants to live in a stone castle."</p>

<p>"Go home then," said the fish. "She
is standing at the door of it already."
So away went the fisherman and found
his wife standing before a great castle.</p>

<p>"See," said she, "is not this grand?"
With that they went into the castle
together and found a great many servants
there and the rooms all richly furnished
and full of golden chairs and tables; and
behind the castle was a garden, and a
wood half a mile long, full of sheep, and
goats, and hares, and deer; and in the
court-yard were stables and cow-houses.</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, "now will we
live contented and happy in this beautiful
castle for the rest of our lives."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we may," said the wife;
"but let us consider and sleep upon it
before we make up our minds": so they
went to bed.</p>

<p>The next morning when Dame Alice
awoke, it was broad daylight, and she
jogged the fisherman with her elbow and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
said, "Get up, husband, and bestir yourself,
for we must be king of all the land."</p>

<p>"Wife, wife," said the man, "why
should we wish to be king? I will not
be king."</p>

<p>"Then I will," said Alice.</p>

<p>"But, wife," answered the fisherman,
"how can you be king? The fish cannot
make you a king."</p>

<p>"Husband," said she, "say no more
about it, but go and try. I will be king!"</p>

<p>So the man went away, quite sorrowful
to think that his wife should want
to be king. The sea looked a dark grey
color, and was covered with foam as he
cried out,</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O man of the sea!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come listen to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Alice my wife,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The plague of my life,</span><br />
Hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!"<br />
</div>

<p>"Well, what would she have now?"
said the fish.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the man, "my wife wants
to be king."</p>

<p>"Go home," said the fish. "She is
king already."</p>

<p>Then the fisherman went home; and
as he came close to the palace, he saw
a troop of soldiers and heard the sound
of drums and trumpets; and when he
entered in, he saw his wife sitting on a
high throne of gold and diamonds, with
a golden crown upon her head; and on
each side of her stood six beautiful
maidens, each a head taller than the
other. "Well, wife," said the fisherman,
"are you king?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "I am king."</p>

<p>And when he had looked at her for a
long time, he said, "Ah, wife! what a fine
thing it is to be king! Now we shall
never have anything more to wish for."</p>

<p>"I don't know how that may be," said
she; "never is a long time. I am king,
'tis true, but I begin to be tired of it,
and I think I should like to be emperor."</p>

<p>"Alas, wife! why should you wish to
be emperor?" said the fisherman.</p>

<p>"Husband," said she, "go to the fish;
I say I will be emperor."</p>

<p>"Ah, wife!" replied the fisherman,
"the fish cannot make an emperor, and
I should not like to ask for such a thing."</p>

<p>"I am king," said Alice, "and you
are my slave, so go directly!"</p>

<p>So the fisherman was obliged to go;
and he muttered as he went along, "This
will come to no good. It is too much to
ask. The fish will be tired at last, and
then we shall repent of what we have
done." He soon arrived at the sea, and
the water was quite black and muddy,
and a mighty whirlwind blew over it;
but he went to the shore, and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O man of the sea!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come listen to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Alice my wife,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The plague of my life,</span><br />

</div>

<p>"What would she have now!" said the
fish.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the fisherman, "she wants
to be emperor."</p>

<p>"Go home," said the fish. "She is
emperor already."</p>

<p>So he went home again; and as he
came near he saw his wife sitting on a
very lofty throne made of solid gold,
with a great crown on her head full two
yards high, and on each side of her stood
her guards and attendants in a row, each
one smaller than the other, from the
tallest giant down to a little dwarf no
bigger than my finger. And before her
stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and
the fisherman went up to her and said,
"Wife, are you emperor?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "I am emperor."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the man as he gazed upon
her, "what a fine thing it is to be
emperor!"</p>

<p>"Husband," said she, "why should we
stay at being emperor; I will be pope
next."</p>

<p>"O wife, wife!" said he, "how can
you be pope? There is but one pope
at a time in Christendom."</p>

<p>"Husband," said she, "I will be pope
this very day."</p>

<p>"But," replied the husband, "the fish
cannot make you pope."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" said she, "if he can
make an emperor, he can make a pope.
Go and try him."</p>

<p>So the fisherman went. But when he
came to the shore the wind was raging,
and the sea was tossed up and down like
boiling water, and the ships were in the
greatest distress and danced upon the
waves most fearfully. In the middle of
the sky there was a little blue, but toward
the south it was all red as if a dreadful
storm were rising. At this the fisherman
was terribly frightened, and trembled, so
that his knees knocked together: but
he went to the shore and said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O man of the sea!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come listen to me,</span><br />

</div>

<p>"What does she want now?" said the
fish.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the fisherman, "my wife
wants to be pope."</p>

<p>"Go home," said the fish. "She is
pope already."</p>

<p>Then the fisherman went home and
found his wife sitting on a throne that
was two miles high; and she had three
great crowns on her head, and around
stood all the pomp and power of the
Church; and on each side were two rows
of burning lights of all sizes, the greatest
as large as the highest and biggest tower
in the world, and the least no larger
than a small rushlight. "Wife," said
the fisherman as he looked at all this
grandeur, "are you pope?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "I am pope."</p>

<p>"Well, wife," replied he, "it is a grand
thing to be pope; and now you must be
content, for you can be nothing greater."</p>

<p>"I will consider of that," said the wife.
Then they went to bed: but Dame Alice
could not sleep all night for thinking
what she should be next. At last morning
came, and the sun rose. "Ha!"
thought she as she looked at it through
the window, "cannot I prevent the sun
rising?" At this she was very angry,
and she wakened her husband and said,
"Husband, go to the fish and tell him I
want to be lord of the sun and moon."
The fisherman was half asleep, but
the thought frightened him so much
that he started and fell out of bed.
"Alas, wife!" said he, "cannot you be
content to be pope?"</p>

<p>"No," said she, "I am very uneasy,
and cannot bear to see the sun and
moon rise without my leave. Go to
the fish directly."</p>

<p>Then the man went trembling for fear;
and as he was going down to the shore
a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees
and the rocks shook; and the heavens
became black, and the lightning played,
and the thunder rolled; and you might
have seen in the sea great black waves
like mountains with a white crown of
foam upon them; and the fisherman
said,</p>

<div class='poem'>

<p>"What does she want now?" said
the fish.</p>

said the fish, "to your ditch again!"
And there they live to this very day.</p>

<div class="hang1">The Grimm version of "The Sleeping Beauty"
is, by all odds, the finest one. Its perfect
economy in the use of story materials has
always been admired. Perrault's version
drags in an unnecessary ogre and spoils
a good story by not knowing when to stop.
The Grimm title is "Dornr&ouml;schen," and the
more literal translation, "Brier Rose," is
the one generally used as the English title,
rather than the one given by Taylor,
whose translation follows. Tennyson has
a very beautiful poetic rendering of this
story in his "Day-Dream."</div>

<h4><br />ROSE-BUD</h4>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a king
and queen who had no children; and this
they lamented very much. But one day
as the queen was walking by the side of
the river, a little fish lifted its head out
of the water and said, "Your wish shall
be fulfilled, and you shall soon have a
daughter."</p>

<p>What the little fish had foretold soon
came to pass; and the queen had a little
girl that was so very beautiful that the
king could not cease looking on it for
joy, and determined to hold a great feast.
So he invited not only his relations,
friends, and neighbors, but also all the
fairies, that they might be kind and good
to his little daughter.</p>

<p>Now there were thirteen fairies in his
kingdom, and he had only twelve golden
dishes for them to eat out of, so he was
obliged to leave one of the fairies without
an invitation. The rest came, and after
the feast was over they gave all their best
gifts to the little princess: one gave her
virtue, another beauty, another riches,
and so on till she had all that was excellent
in the world. When eleven had done
blessing her, the thirteenth, who had not
been invited and was very angry on that
account, came in and determined to take
her revenge. So she cried out, "The
king's daughter shall in her fifteenth year
be wounded by a spindle, and fall down
dead."</p>

<p>Then the twelfth, who had not yet
given her gift, came forward and said
that the bad wish must be fulfilled, but
that she could soften it, and that the
king's daughter should not die, but fall
asleep for a hundred years.</p>

<p>But the king hoped to save his dear
child from the threatened evil and ordered
that all the spindles in the kingdom
should be bought up and destroyed. All
the fairies' gifts were in the meantime
fulfilled, for the princess was so beautiful,
and well-behaved, and amiable, and wise
that every one who knew her loved her.
Now it happened that on the very day
she was fifteen years old the king and
queen were not at home, and she was left
alone in the palace. So she roved about
by herself and looked at all the rooms
and chambers till at last she came to an
old tower, to which there was a narrow
staircase ending with a little door. In
the door there was a golden key, and when
she turned it the door sprang open, and
there sat an old lady spinning away very
busily. "Why, how now, good mother,"
said the princess, "what are you doing
there?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Spinning," said the old lady, and
nodded her head.</p>

<p>"How prettily that little thing turns
round!" said the princess, and took the
spindle and began to spin. But scarcely
had she touched it before the prophecy
was fulfilled, and she fell down lifeless on
the ground.</p>

<p>However, she was not dead, but had
only fallen into a deep sleep; and the king
and the queen, who just then came home,
and all their court, fell asleep too; and the
horses slept in the stables, and the dogs
in the court, the pigeons on the house-top
and the flies on the walls. Even the
fire on the hearth left off blazing and
went to sleep; and the meat that was
roasting stood still; and the cook, who
was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy
by the hair to give him a box on the
ear for something he had done amiss,
let him go, and both fell asleep; and so
everything stood still, and slept soundly.</p>

<p>A large hedge of thorns soon grew
round the palace, and every year it
became higher and thicker till at last the
whole palace was surrounded and hid,
so that not even the roof or the chimneys
could be seen. But there went a report
through all the land of the beautiful
sleeping Rose-Bud (for so was the king's
daughter called); so that from time to
time several kings' sons came and tried
to break through the thicket into the
palace. This they could never do, for
the thorns and bushes laid hold of them
as it were with hands, and there they
stuck fast and died miserably.</p>

<p>After many many years there came a
king's son into that land, and an old man
told him the story of the thicket of
thorns, and how a beautiful palace stood
behind it, in which was a wondrous princess,
called Rose-Bud, asleep with all her
court. He told, too, how he had heard
from his grandfather that many many
princes had come, and had tried to break
through the thicket, but had stuck fast
and died. Then the young prince said,
"All this shall not frighten me. I will
go and see Rose-Bud." The old man
tried to dissuade him, but he persisted
in going.</p>

<p>Now that very day were the hundred
years completed; and as the prince came
to the thicket, he saw nothing but beautiful
flowering shrubs, through which he
passed with ease, and they closed after
him as firm as ever. Then he came at
last to the palace, and there in the court
lay the dogs asleep, and the horses in the
stables, and on the roof sat the pigeons
fast asleep with their heads under their
wings; and when he came into the palace,
the flies slept on the walls, and the cook
in the kitchen was still holding up her
hand as if she would beat the boy, and the
maid sat with a black fowl in her hand
ready to be plucked.</p>

<p>Then he went on still further, and all
was so still that he could hear every
breath he drew; till at last he came to the
old tower and opened the door of the little
room in which Rose-Bud was, and there
she lay fast asleep, and looked so beautiful
that he could not take his eyes off, and
he stooped down and gave her a kiss.
But the moment he kissed her she opened
her eyes and awoke and smiled upon him.
Then they went out together, and presently
the king and queen also awoke, and
all the court, and they gazed on one
another with great wonder. And the
horses got up and shook themselves, and
the dogs jumped about and barked; the
pigeons took their heads from under their
wings and looked about and flew into the
fields; the flies on the walls buzzed away;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the fire in the kitchen blazed up and
cooked the dinner, and the roast meat
turned round again; the cook gave the
boy the box on his ear so that he cried
out, and the maid went on plucking the
fowl. And then was the wedding of the
prince and Rose-Bud celebrated, and they
lived happily together all their lives long.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_178" id="Note_178">178</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The story of "Rumpelstiltskin" is taken from
Margaret Hunt's translation of Grimm.
It is the same story as "Tom Tit Tot"
(No. <a href="#Note_160">160</a>), and is given in order that the
teacher may compare the two. Grimm's
is the most familiar of the many versions
of this tale and is probably the best for use
with children, although the "little man"
lacks some of the fascinating power of
"that" with its twirling tail.</div>


<h4><br />RUMPELSTILTSKIN</h4>

<p>Once there was a miller who was poor,
but who had a beautiful daughter. Now
it happened that he had to go and speak
to the King, and in order to make himself
appear important he said to him,
"I have a daughter who can spin straw
into gold."</p>

<p>The King said to the miller, "That
is an art which pleases me well. If
your daughter is as clever as you say,
bring her tomorrow to my palace, and
I will try what she can do."</p>

<p>And when the girl was brought to
him he took her into a room which
was quite full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel
and a reel, and said, "Now
set to work, and if by tomorrow morning
early you have not spun this straw into
gold during the night, you must die."
Thereupon he himself locked up the
room, and left her in it alone. So there
sat the poor miller's daughter, and for
her life could not tell what to do. She
had no idea how straw could be spun
into gold, and she grew more and more
miserable, until at last she began to
weep.</p>

<p>But all at once the door opened, and
in came a little man, and said, "Good
evening, Mistress Miller; why are you
crying so?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" answered the girl, "I have to
spin straw into gold, and I do not know
how to do it."</p>

<p>"What will you give me," said the
manikin, "if I do it for you?"</p>

<p>"My necklace," said the girl. The
little man took the necklace, seated himself
in front of the wheel, and "whir,
whir, whir," three turns, and the reel
was full; then he put another on, and
"whir, whir, whir," three times round,
and the second was full, too. And so
it went on until the morning, when all
the straw was spun, and all the reels
were full of gold. By daybreak the
King was already there, and when he
saw the gold he was astonished and
delighted, but his heart became only
more greedy. He had the miller's daughter
taken into another room full of straw,
which was much larger, and commanded
her to spin that also in one night if she
valued her life. The girl knew not how
to help herself, and was crying, when
the door again opened, and the little
man appeared, and said, "What will
you give me if I spin the straw into gold
for you?"</p>

<p>"The ring on my finger," answered
the girl.</p>

<p>The little man took the ring, again
began to turn the wheel, and by morning
had spun all the straw into glittering
gold.</p>

<p>The King rejoiced beyond measure
at the sight, but still he had not gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
enough; and he had the miller's daughter
taken into a still larger room full of straw,
and said, "You must spin this, too, in
the course of this night; but if you
succeed, you shall be my wife." "Even
if she be a miller's daughter," thought
he, "I could not find a richer wife in the
whole world."</p>

<p>When the girl was alone the manikin
came again for the third time, and said,
"What will you give me if I spin the
straw for you this time also?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing left that I could
give," answered the girl.</p>

<p>"Then promise me, if you should
become Queen, your first child."</p>

<p>"Who knows whether that will ever
happen?" thought the miller's daughter;
and, not knowing how else to help herself
in this strait, she promised the
manikin what he wanted, and for that
he once more spun the straw into gold.</p>

<p>And when the King came in the morning,
and found all as he had wished, he
took her in marriage, and the pretty
miller's daughter became a Queen.</p>

<p>A year after, she had a beautiful
child, and she never gave a thought to
the manikin. But suddenly he came
into her room, and said, "Now give me
what you promised."</p>

<p>The Queen was horror-struck, and
offered the manikin all the riches of
the kingdom if he would leave her the
child. But the manikin said, "No,
something that is living is dearer to me
than all the treasures in the world."</p>

<p>Then the Queen began to weep and
cry, so that the manikin pitied her. "I
will give you three days' time," said he;
"if by that time you find out my name,
then shall you keep your child."</p>

<p>So the Queen thought the whole night
of all the names that she had ever
heard, and she sent a messenger over
the country to inquire, far and wide,
for any other names that there might
be. When the manikin came the next
day, she began with Caspar, Melchior,
Balthazar, and said all the names she
knew, one after another; but to every
one the little man said, "That is not
my name." On the second day she had
inquiries made in the neighborhood as
to the names of the people there, and
she repeated to the manikin the most
uncommon and curious. "Perhaps your
name is Shortribs, or Sheepshanks, or
Laceleg?" but he always answered,
"That is not my name."</p>

<p>On the third day the messenger came
back again, and said, "I have not been
able to find a single new name, but as I
came to a high mountain at the end of
the forest, where the fox and the hare
bid each other good-night, there I saw
a little house, and before the house a
fire was burning, and round about the
fire quite a ridiculous little man was
jumping; he hopped upon one leg, and
shouted:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To-day I bake, to-morrow brew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The next I'll have the young Queen's child.</span><br />
Ha! glad am I that no one knew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Rumpelstiltskin I am styled.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>You may think how glad the Queen
was when she heard the name! And
when soon afterwards the little man
came in, and asked, "Now, Mistress
Queen, what is my name?"</p>

<p>At first she said, "Is your name
Conrad?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is your name Harry?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"The devil has told you that! the devil
has told you that!" cried the little man,
and in his anger he plunged his right
foot so deep into the earth that his whole
leg went in; and then in rage he pulled
at his left leg so hard with both hands
that he tore himself in two.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_179" id="Note_179">179</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Margaret Hunt's translation of Grimm's
"Snow-White and Rose-Red" follows. It
has long been recognized as one of the most
beautiful and appealing of folk tales. The
scenic effects, the domestic life with its
maternal and filial affection, the kindness
to animals and helpfulness to each other
and to those in distress, the adventures with
dwarf and bear, the magic enchantment
of goodness through the power of evil, and
the happy conclusion following the removal
of this enchantment&mdash;all these are blended
into a perfect union that never fails to
delight the listener of any age.</div>

<h4><br />SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED</h4>

<p>There was once a poor widow who
lived in a lonely cottage. In front of
the cottage was a garden wherein stood
two rose-trees, one of which bore white
and the other red roses. She had two
children who were like the two rose-trees,
and one was called Snow-white,
and the other Rose-red. They were as
good and happy, as busy and cheerful
as ever two children in the world were,
only Snow-white was more quiet and
gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red liked
better to run about in the meadows and
fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies;
but Snow-white sat at home with
her mother, and helped her with her
housework, or read to her when there
was nothing to do.</p>

<p>The two children were so fond of each
other that they always held each other
by the hand when they went out together,
and when Snow-white said, "We will
not leave each other," Rose-red answered,
"Never so long as we live," and their
mother would add, "What one has she
must share with the other."</p>

<p>They often ran about the forest alone
and gathered red berries, and no beasts
did them any harm, but came close to
them trustfully. The little hare would
eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands,
the roe grazed by their side, the stag
leaped merrily by them, and the birds
sat still upon the boughs and sang
whatever they knew.</p>

<p>No mishap overtook them; if they
had stayed too late in the forest, and
night came on, they laid themselves down
near each other upon the moss and
slept until morning came, and their
mother knew this and had no distress
on their account.</p>

<p>Once when they had spent the night
in the wood and the dawn had roused
them, they saw a beautiful child in a
shining white dress sitting near their
bed. He got up and looked quite kindly
at them, but said nothing and went
away into the forest. And when they
looked round they found that they had
been sleeping quite close to a precipice,
and would certainly have fallen into
it in the darkness if they had gone
only a few paces farther. And their
mother told them that it must have
been the angel who watches over good
children.</p>

<p>Snow-white and Rose-red kept their
mother's little cottage so neat that it
was a pleasure to look inside it. In
the summer Rose-red took care of the
house, and every morning laid a wreath
of flowers by her mother's bed before
she awoke, in which was a rose from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
each tree. In the winter Snow-white
lit the fire and hung the kettle on the
crane. The kettle was of copper and
shone like gold, so brightly was it
polished. In the evening, when the
snowflakes fell, the mother said, "Go,
Snow-white, and bolt the door," and
then they sat round the hearth, and the
mother took her spectacles and read
aloud out of a large book, and the two
girls listened as they sat and spun.
And close by them lay a lamb upon the
floor, and behind them upon a perch
sat a white dove with its head hidden
beneath its wings.</p>

<p>One evening, as they were thus sitting
comfortably together, some one knocked
at the door as if he wished to be let in.
The mother said, "Quick, Rose-red,
open the door, it must be a traveler
who is seeking shelter." Rose-red went
and pushed back the bolt, thinking that
it was a poor man, but it was not; it
was a bear that stretched his broad,
black head within the door.</p>

<p>Rose-red screamed and sprang back,
the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered,
and Snow-white hid herself behind her
mother's bed. But the bear began to
speak and said, "Do not be afraid, I
will do you no harm! I am half-frozen,
and only want to warm myself a little
beside you."</p>

<p>"Poor bear," said the mother, "lie
down by the fire, only take care that
you do not burn your coat." Then she
cried, "Snow-white, Rose-red, come out;
the bear will do you no harm; he means
well." So they both came out, and
by-and-by the lamb and dove came
nearer, and were not afraid of him.</p>

<p>The bear said, "Here, children, knock
the snow out of my coat a little"; so
they brought the broom and swept the
bear's hide clean; and he stretched himself
by the fire and growled contentedly
and comfortably. It was not long before
they grew quite at home and played
tricks with their clumsy guest. They
tugged his hair with their hands, put
their feet upon his back and rolled him
about, or they took a hazel-switch and
beat him, and when he growled they
laughed. But the bear took it all in
good part, only when they were too
rough he called out, "Leave me alive,
children&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Snowy-white, Rosy-red,<br />
Will you beat your lover dead?"<br />
</div>

<p>When it was bed-time, and the others
went to bed, the mother said to the bear,
"You can lie there by the hearth, and
then you will be safe from the cold and
the bad weather." As soon as day
dawned the two children let him out,
and he trotted across the snow into
the forest.</p>

<p>Henceforth the bear came every evening
at the same time, laid himself down
by the hearth, and let the children amuse
themselves with him as much as they
liked; and they got so used to him that
the doors were never fastened until
their black friend had arrived.</p>

<p>When spring had come and all outside
was green, the bear said one morning
to Snow-white, "Now I must go away,
and cannot come back for the whole
summer."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, then, dear
bear?" asked Snow-white.</p>

<p>"I must go into the forest and guard
my treasures from the wicked dwarfs.
In the winter, when the earth is frozen
hard, they are obliged to stay below and
cannot work their way through; but
now, when the sun has thawed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
warmed the earth, they break through
it, and come out to pry and steal; and
what once gets into their hands, and in
their caves, does not easily see daylight
again."</p>

<p>Snow-white was quite sorry for his
going away, and as she unbolted the
door for him, and the bear was hurrying
out, he caught against the bolt and a
piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and
it seemed to Snow-white as if she had
seen gold shining through it, but she
was not sure about it. The bear ran
away quickly, and was soon out of sight
behind the trees.</p>

<p>A short time afterwards the mother
sent her children into the forest to get
fire-wood. There they found a big tree
which lay felled on the ground, and close
by the trunk something was jumping
backwards and forwards in the grass,
but they could not make out what it
was. When they came nearer they saw
a dwarf with an old withered face and a
snow-white beard a yard long. The end
of the beard was caught in a crevice of
the tree, and the little fellow was jumping
backwards and forwards like a dog
tied to a rope, and did not know what
to do.</p>

<p>He glared at the girls with his fiery
red eyes and cried, "Why do you stand
there? Can you not come here and help
me?"</p>

<p>"What are you about there, little
man?" asked Rose-red.</p>

<p>"You stupid, prying goose!" answered
the dwarf; "I was going to split the
tree to get a little wood for cooking.
The little bit of food that one of us
wants gets burnt up directly with thick
logs; we do not swallow so much as
you coarse, greedy folk. I had just
driven the wedge safely in, and everything
was going as I wished; but the
wretched wood was too smooth and
suddenly sprang asunder, and the tree
closed so quickly that I could not pull
out my beautiful white beard; so now
it is tight in and I cannot get away,
and you silly, sleek, milk-faced things
laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!"</p>

<p>The children tried very hard, but they
could not pull the beard out, it was
caught too fast. "I will run and fetch
some one," said Rose-red.</p>

<p>"You senseless goose!" snarled the
dwarf; "why should you fetch some
one? You are already two too many
for me; can you not think of something
better?"</p>

<p>"Don't be impatient," said Snow-white,
"I will help you," and she pulled
her scissors out of her pocket, and cut
off the end of the beard.</p>

<p>As soon as the dwarf felt himself free
he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst
the roots of the tree, and which was
full of gold, and lifted it up, grumbling
to himself, "Uncouth people, to cut off
a piece of my fine beard. Bad luck to
you!" and then he swung the bag upon
his back, and went off without even
once looking at the children.</p>

<p>Some time after that Snow-white and
Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish.
As they came near the brook they saw
something like a large grasshopper jumping
towards the water, as if it were
going to leap in. They ran to it and
found it was the dwarf. "Where are
you going?" said Rose-red; "you surely
don't want to go into the water?"</p>

<p>"I am not such a fool!" cried the
dwarf; "don't you see that the accursed
fish wants to pull me in?"</p>

<p>The little man had been sitting there
fishing, and unluckily the wind had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
twisted his beard with the fishing line;
just then a big fish bit, and the feeble
creature had not strength to pull it out;
the fish kept the upper hand and pulled
the dwarf towards him. He held on to
all the reeds and rushes, but it was
of little good, he was forced to follow
the movements of the fish, and was in
urgent danger of being dragged into the
water.</p>

<p>The girls came just in time; they
held him fast and tried to free his
beard from the line, but all in vain,
beard and line were entangled fast
together. Nothing was left but to bring
out the scissors and cut the beard,
whereby a small part of it was lost.
When the dwarf saw that he screamed
out, "Is that civil, you toadstool, to
disfigure one's face? Was it not enough
to clip off the end of my beard? Now
you have cut off the best part of it.
I cannot let myself be seen by my
people. I wish you had been made to
run the soles off your shoes!" Then
he took out a sack of pearls which lay
in the rushes, and without saying a
word more he dragged it away and
disappeared behind a stone.</p>

<p>It happened that soon afterwards the
mother sent the two children to the
town to buy needles and thread, and
laces and ribbons. The road led them
across a heath upon which huge pieces
of rock lay strewn here and there. Now
they noticed a large bird hovering in
the air, flying slowly round and round
above them; it sank lower and lower,
and at last settled near a rock not far
off. Directly afterwards they heard a
loud, piteous cry. They ran up and
saw with horror that the eagle had
seized their old acquaintance the dwarf,
and was going to carry him off.</p>

<p>The children, full of pity, at once
took tight hold of the little man, and
pulled against the eagle so long that at
last he let his booty go. As soon as
the dwarf had recovered from his first
fright he cried with his shrill voice,
"Could you not have done it more
carefully? You dragged at my brown
coat so that it is all torn and full of
holes, you helpless, clumsy creatures!"
Then he took up a sack full of precious
stones, and slipped away again under
the rock into his hole. The girls, who
by this time were used to his thanklessness,
went on their way and did their
business in the town.</p>

<p>As they crossed the heath again on
their way home they surprised the
dwarf, who had emptied out his bag
of precious stones in a clean spot, and
had not thought that any one would
come there so late. The evening sun
shone upon the brilliant stones; they
glittered and sparkled with all colors so
beautifully that the children stood still
and looked at them. "Why do you
stand gaping there?" cried the dwarf,
and his ashen-gray face became copper-red
with rage. He was going on with
his bad words when a loud growling was
heard, and a black bear came trotting
towards them out of the forest. The
dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he
could not get to his cave, for the bear
was already close. Then in the dread
of his heart he cried, "Dear Mr. Bear,
spare me, I will give you all my treasures;
look, the beautiful jewels lying there!
Grant me my life; what do you want
with such a slender little fellow as I?
You would not feel me between your
teeth. Come, take these two wicked
girls, they are tender morsels for you,
fat as young quails; for mercy's sake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
eat them!" The bear took no heed of
his words, but gave the wicked creature
a single blow with his paw, and he did
not move again.</p>

<p>The girls had run away, but the bear
called to them, "Snow-white and Rose-red,
do not be afraid; wait, I will come
with you." Then they knew his voice
and waited, and when he came up to
them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and
he stood there a handsome man, clothed
all in gold. "I am a King's son," he
said, "and I was bewitched by that
wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures.
I have had to run about the
forest as a savage bear until I was freed
by his death. Now he has got his
well-deserved punishment."</p>

<p>Snow-white was married to him, and
Rose-red to his brother, and they divided
between them the great treasures which
the dwarf had gathered together in his
cave. The old mother lived peacefully
and happily with her children for many
years. She took the two rose-trees with
her, and they stood before her window,
and every year bore the most beautiful
roses, white and red.</p>

<div class="hang1">Whether it is possible to trace all folk tales to
India, as some scholars have contended, is a
matter yet open to debate. But there can
be no doubt that some of the most instructing
and valuable of folk tales for use with
children are found in the various collections
of Indian stories made since the pioneer
work of Mary Frere in her <i>Old Deccan
Days</i> (1868). A voluminous literature of
collections and comment has grown up and
is constantly increasing. Four stories that
have won great favor with children are
given immediately following as the ones
probably best fitted for an introductory
course. "The Lambikin" is one of the
most popular of all. It is an accumulative
droll in character and should be told early
along with, say, "The Story of the Three
Little Pigs." The children will be sure to
notice that Lambikin trundling along in
his drumikin has some similarity to the wise
pig who traveled so fast down hill in his
new churn. The story is taken from <i>Tales
from the Punjab</i>, collected by Flora Annie
Steel, with very valuable notes and analyses
by Captain R. C. Temple.</div>


<h4><br />THE LAMBIKIN</h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was a wee wee
Lambikin, who frolicked about on his
little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself
amazingly. Now one day he set off to visit
his Granny, and was jumping with joy
to think of all the good things he should
get from her, when whom should he meet
but a Jackal, who looked at the tender
young morsel and said: "Lambikin!
Lambikin! I'll <span class="smcap">eat</span> YOU!"</p>

<p>But Lambikin only gave a little frisk
and said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"To Granny's house I go,<br />
Where I shall fatter grow,<br />
Then you can eat me so."<br />
</div>

<p>The Jackal thought this reasonable,
and let Lambikin pass.</p>

<p>By and by he met a Vulture, and the
Vulture, looking hungrily at the tender
morsel before him, said: "Lambikin!
Lambikin! I'll <span class="smcap">eat</span> YOU!"</p>

<p>But Lambikin only gave a little frisk,
and said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"To Granny's house I go,<br />
Where I shall fatter grow,<br />
Then you can eat me so."<br />
</div>

<p>The Vulture thought this reasonable,
and let Lambikin pass.</p>

<p>And by and by he met a Tiger, and then
a Wolf, and a Dog, and an Eagle, and
all these, when they saw the tender little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
morsel, said: "Lambikin! Lambikin!
I'll <span class="smcap">eat</span> YOU!"</p>

<p>But to all of them Lambikin replied,
with a little frisk:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"To Granny's house I go,<br />
Where I shall fatter grow,<br />
Then you can eat me so."<br />
</div>

<p>At last he reached his Granny's house,
and said, all in a great hurry, "Granny,
dear, I've promised to get very fat; so,
as people ought to keep their promises,
please put me into the corn-bin <i>at once</i>."</p>

<p>So his Granny said he was a good boy,
and put him into the corn-bin, and there
the greedy little Lambikin stayed for
seven days, and ate, and ate, and ate,
until he could scarcely waddle, and his
Granny said he was fat enough for anything,
and must go home. But cunning
little Lambikin said that would never do,
for some animal would be sure to eat him
on the way back, he was so plump and
tender.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what you must do,"
said Master Lambikin, "you must make
a little drumikin out of the skin of my
little brother who died, and then I can
sit inside and trundle along nicely, for
I'm as tight as a drum myself."</p>

<p>So his Granny made a nice little drumikin
out of his brother's skin, with the
wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself
up snug and warm in the middle,
and trundled away gayly. Soon he met
with the Eagle, who called out:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Drumikin! Drumikin!<br />
Have you seen Lambikin?"<br />
</div>

<p>And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his
soft warm nest, replied:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Lost in the forest, and so are you,<br />
On, little Drumikin! Tum-pa, tum-too!"<br />
</div>

<p>"How very annoying!" sighed the
Eagle, thinking regretfully of the tender
morsel he had let slip.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along,
laughing to himself, and singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Tum-pa, tum-too;<br />
Tum-pa, tum-too!"<br />
</div>

<p>Every animal and bird he met asked
him the same question:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Drumikin! Drumikin!<br />
Have you seen Lambikin?"<br />
</div>

<p>And to each of them the little sly-boots
replied:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Lost in the forest, and so are you,<br />
On, little Drumikin! Tum-pa, tum-too;<br />
Tum-pa, tum-too; tum-pa, tum-too!"<br />
</div>

<p>Then they all sighed to think of the
tender little morsel they had let slip.</p>

<p>At last the Jackal came limping along,
for all his sorry looks as sharp as a needle,
and he too called out:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Drumikin! Drumikin!<br />
Have you seen Lambikin?"<br />
</div>

<p>And Lambikin, curled up in his snug
little nest, replied gayly:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Lost in the forest, and so are you,<br />
On, little Drumikin! Tum-pa&mdash;"<br />
</div>

<p>But he never got any further, for the
Jackal recognized his voice at once, and
cried: "Hullo! you've turned yourself
inside out, have you? Just you come
out of that!"</p>

<p>Whereupon he tore open Drumikin
and gobbled up Lambikin.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_181" id="Note_181">181</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The next story, dealing with the idea of
"measure for measure," is from Mary
Frere's <i>Old Deccan Days</i>. Miss Frere spent
many years in India, where her father was
a government official. She took down the
tales as told by her <i>ayah</i>, or lady's maid,
who in turn had heard them from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
hundred-year-old grandmother. It may
be said of this story that while retaliation
is certainly not the highest law of conduct,
yet the ungracious, inconsiderate action
of the jackal makes it impossible to feel
the least sympathy for him.</div>


<h4><br />TIT FOR TAT</h4>

<p>There once lived a Camel and a Jackal
who were great friends. One day the
Jackal said to the Camel, "I know that
there is a fine field of sugar cane on the
other side of the river. If you will take
me across, I'll show you the place. This
plan will suit me as well as you. You
will enjoy eating the sugar cane, and I
am sure to find many crabs, bones, and
bits of fish by the river side, on which to
make a good dinner."</p>

<p>The Camel consented, and swam across
the river, taking the Jackal, who could
not swim, on his back. When they
reached the other side, the Camel went
to eat the sugar cane, and the Jackal ran
up and down the river bank, devouring
all the crabs, bits of fish, and bones he
could find.</p>

<p>But being so much smaller an animal,
he had made an excellent meal before the
Camel had eaten more than two or three
mouthfuls; and no sooner had he finished
his dinner than he ran round and round
the sugar-cane field, yelping and howling
with all his might.</p>

<p>The villagers heard him, and thought,
"There is a Jackal among the sugar canes;
he will be scratching holes in the ground
and spoiling the roots of the plants."
And they went down to the place to drive
him away. But when they got there they
found to their surprise not only a Jackal,
but a Camel who was eating the sugar
canes! This made them very angry, and
they caught the poor Camel and drove
him from the field and beat him until he
was nearly dead.</p>

<p>When the villagers had gone, the
Jackal said to the Camel, "We had better
go home." And the Camel, said, "Very
well; then jump upon my back, as you
did before."</p>

<p>So the Jackal jumped upon the Camel's
back, and the Camel began to recross the
river. When they had got well into the
water, the Camel said, "This is a pretty
way in which you have treated me,
friend Jackal. No sooner had you finished
your own dinner than you must
go yelping about the place loud enough to
arouse the whole village, and bring all
the villagers down to beat me black and
blue, and turn me out of the field before
I had eaten two mouthfuls! What in the
world did you make such a noise for?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the Jackal. "It
is a custom I have. I always like to sing
a little after dinner."</p>

<p>The Camel waded on through the river.
The water reached up to his knees&mdash;then
above them&mdash;up, up, up, higher and
higher, until at last he was obliged to
swim.</p>

<p>Then turning to the Jackal, he said,
"I feel very anxious to roll."</p>

<p>"Oh, pray don't; why do you wish to
do so?" asked the Jackal.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered the Camel.
"It is a custom I have. I always like to
have a little roll after dinner."</p>

<p>So saying, he rolled over in the water,
shaking the Jackal off as he did so. And
the Jackal was drowned, but the Camel
swam safely ashore.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_182" id="Note_182">182</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The fine story following is from Steel's <i>Tales
of the Punjab</i>. Scholars have pointed out
a hundred or more variants. Such trickery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
as that used by the jackal in trapping the
tiger is the common thing to find in folk
tales where oppressed weakness is matched
against ruthless and tyrannic power. The
tiger's ingratitude precludes any desire to
"take his part." The attitude of the three
judges is determined in each case by the
fact that the experience of each has hardened
him and rendered him completely
hopeless and unsympathetic. "The work of
the buffalo in the oil-press," says Captain
Temple, "is the synonym all India over&mdash;and
with good reason&mdash;for hard and thankless
toil for another's benefit."</div>

<h4><br />THE TIGER, THE BRAHMAN,
AND THE JACKAL</h4>

<p>Once upon a time a tiger was caught in
a trap. He tried in vain to get out
through the bars, and rolled and bit with
rage and grief when he failed.</p>

<p>By chance a poor Brahman came by.
"Let me out of this cage, O pious one!"
cried the tiger.</p>

<p>"Nay, my friend," replied the Brahman
mildly; "you would probably eat
me if I did."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" swore the tiger with
many oaths; "on the contrary, I should
be forever grateful, and serve you as a
slave."</p>

<p>Now, when the tiger sobbed and sighed
and wept and swore, the pious Brahman's
heart softened, and at last he consented
to open the door of the cage. Out
popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor
man, cried, "What a fool you are! What
is to prevent my eating you now, for after
being cooped up so long I am just terribly
hungry?"</p>

<p>In vain the Brahman pleaded for his
life; the most he could gain was a promise
to abide by the decision of the first three
things he chose to question as to the
justice of the tiger's action.</p>

<p>So the Brahman first asked a <i>pipal</i>
tree what it thought of the matter, but
the <i>pipal</i> tree replied coldly, "What have
you to complain about? Don't I give
shade and shelter to every one who passes
by, and don't they in return tear down
my branches to feed their cattle? Don't
whimper&mdash;be a man!"</p>

<p>Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went
further afield till he saw a buffalo turning
a well-wheel; but he fared no better from
it, for it answered: "You are a fool to
expect gratitude! Look at me! While I
gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and
oil-cake, but now I am dry they yoke
me here, and give me refuse as fodder!"</p>

<p>The Brahman, still more sad, asked
the road to give him its opinion.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," said the road, "how
foolish you are to expect anything else!
Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all,
rich and poor, great and small, trample
on me as they go past, giving me nothing
but the ashes of their pipes and the husks
of their grain!"</p>

<p>On this the Brahman turned back
sorrowfully, and on the way he met a
jackal, who called out, "Why, what's the
matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as
miserable as a fish out of water!"</p>

<p>The Brahman told him all that had
occurred. "How very confusing!" said
the jackal, when the recital was ended;
"would you mind telling me over again,
for everything seems so mixed up?"</p>

<p>The Brahman told it all over again,
but the jackal shook his head in a distracted
sort of way, and still could not
understand.</p>

<p>"It's very odd," said he sadly, "but it
all seems to go in at one ear and out at
the other! I will go to the place where it
all happened, and then, perhaps, I shall
be able to give a judgment."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>So they returned to the cage, by
which the tiger was waiting for the
Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and
claws.</p>

<p>"You've been away a long time!"
growled the savage beast, "but now let
us begin our dinner."</p>

<p>"<i>Our</i> dinner!" thought the wretched
Brahman, as his knees knocked together
with fright; "what a remarkably delicate
way of putting it!"</p>

<p>"Give me five minutes, my lord!" he
pleaded, "in order that I may explain
matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat
slow in his wits."</p>

<p>The tiger consented, and the Brahman
began the whole story over again, not
missing a single detail, and spinning as
long a yarn as possible.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor
brain!" cried the jackal, wringing its
paws. "Let me see! how did it all begin?
You were in the cage, and the tiger came
walking by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" interrupted the tiger, "what
a fool you are! <i>I</i> was in the cage."</p>

<p>"Of course!" cried the jackal, pretending
to tremble with fright; "yes! I
was in the cage&mdash;no, I wasn't&mdash;dear!
dear! where are my wits? Let me see&mdash;the
tiger was in the Brahman, and the
cage came walking by&mdash;no, that's not it,
either! Well, don't mind me, but begin
your dinner, for I shall never understand!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you shall!" returned the tiger,
in a rage at the jackal's stupidity; "I'll
<i>make</i> you understand! Look here&mdash;I
am the tiger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord!"</p>

<p>"And that is the Brahman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord!"</p>

<p>"And that is the cage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord!"</p>

<p>"And I was in the cage&mdash;do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;Please, my lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" cried the tiger impatiently.</p>

<p>"Please, my lord! How did you get
in?"</p>

<p>"How? Why in the usual way, of
course!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me! my head is beginning
to whirl again! Please don't be angry,
my lord, but what is the usual way?"</p>

<p>At this the tiger lost patience, and
jumping into the cage, cried, "This way!
Now do you understand how it was?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly!" grinned the jackal, as he
dexterously shut the door, "and if you
will permit me to say so, I think matters
will remain as they were!"</p>

Indian mercantile numerals into those of
English 'back-slang,' which make a very
good parallel." As in other cases, the
value of Jacobs' collection must be emphasized.
If the teacher is limited to a
single book for story material from the
Hindoos, that book must be the one made
by Joseph Jacobs. With well-chosen tales,
with the slight changes here and there
necessary for use with children, with just
enough scholarship packed out of the way

no rival.</div>


<h4><br />PRIDE GOETH BEFORE
A FALL</h4>

<p>In a certain village there lived ten
cloth merchants, who always went about
together. Once upon a time they had
traveled far afield, and were returning
home with a great deal of money which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
they had obtained by selling their wares.
Now there happened to be a dense forest
near their village, and this they reached
early one morning. In it there lived
three notorious robbers, of whose existence
the traders had never heard, and
while they were still in the middle of it
the robbers stood before them, with
swords and cudgels in their hands, and
ordered them to lay down all they had.
The traders had no weapons with them,
and so, though they were many more in
number, they had to submit themselves
to the robbers, who took away everything
from them, even the very clothes they
wore, and gave to each only a small
loin-cloth a span in breadth and a cubit
in length.</p>

<p>The idea that they had conquered ten
men and plundered all their property
now took possession of the robbers'
minds. They seated themselves like
three monarchs before the men they had
plundered, and ordered them to dance to
them before returning home. The merchants
now mourned their fate. They
had lost all they had, except their loin-cloth,
and still the robbers were not
satisfied, but ordered them to dance.</p>

<p>There was among the ten merchants
one who was very clever. He pondered
over the calamity that had come upon
him and his friends, the dance they would
have to perform, and the magnificent
manner in which the three robbers had
seated themselves on the grass. At the
same time he observed that these last
had placed their weapons on the ground,
in the assurance of having thoroughly
cowed the traders, who were now commencing
to dance; and, as a song is always
sung by the leader on such occasions, to
which the rest keep time with hands and
feet, he thus began to sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"We are enty men,<br />
They are erith men:<br />
If each erith man,<br />
Surround eno men<br />
Eno man remains.<br />
<br />
<i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ta, tai tom'">T&acirc;, tai t&ocirc;m</ins>, tadingana.</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>The robbers were all uneducated, and
thought that the leader was merely singing
a song as usual. So it was in one
sense; for the leader commenced from a
distance, and had sung the song over
twice before he and his companions
commenced to approach the robbers.
They had understood his meaning, because
they had been trained in trade.</p>

<p>When two traders discuss the price of
an article in the presence of a purchaser,
they use a riddling sort of language.</p>

<p>"What is the price of this cloth?" one
trader will ask.</p>

<p>"Enty rupees," another will reply,
meaning "ten rupees."</p>

<p>Thus there is no possibility of the purchaser
knowing what is meant unless he
be acquainted with trade language. By
the rules of this secret language erith
means "three," enty means "ten," and
eno means "one." So the leader by his
song meant to hint to his fellow-traders
that they were ten men, the robbers only
three, that if three pounced upon each of
the robbers, nine of them could hold
them down, while the remaining one
bound the robbers' hands and feet.</p>

<p>The three thieves, glorying in their
victory, and little understanding the
meaning of the song and the intentions
of the dancers, were proudly seated
chewing betel and tobacco. Meanwhile
the song was sung a third time. <i>T&acirc; tai
t&ocirc;m</i> had left the lips of the singer; and,
before <i>tadingana</i> was out of them, the
traders separated into parties of three,
and each party pounced upon a thief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
The remaining one&mdash;the leader himself&mdash;tore
up into long narrow strips a large
piece of cloth, six cubits long, and tied
the hands and feet of the robbers. These
were entirely humbled now, and rolled
on the ground like three bags of rice!</p>

<p>The ten traders now took back all
their property, and armed themselves
with the swords and cudgels of their
enemies; and when they reached their
village they often amused their friends
and relatives by relating their adventure.</p>

<h4><br />THE MIRROR OF MATSUYAMA</h4>

<div class='center'>VERSION BY TERESA PEIRCE WILLISTON</div>

<p>In Matsuyama there lived a man,
his wife, and their little daughter. They
loved each other very much, and were
very happy together. One day the man
came home very sad. He had received
a message from the Emperor, which
said that he must take a journey to
far-off Tokio.</p>

<p>They had no horses and in those days
there were no railroads in Japan. The
man knew that he must walk the whole
distance. It was not the long walk that
he minded, however. It was because it
would take him many days from home.</p>

<p>Still he must obey his Emperor, so
he made ready to start. His wife was
very sorry that he must go, and yet a
little proud, too, for no one else in the
village had ever taken so long a journey.</p>

<p>She and the baby walked with him
down to the turn in the road. There
they stood and watched him through
their tears, as he followed the path up
through the pines on the mountain side.
At last, no larger than a speck, he disappeared
behind the hills. Then they
went home to await his return.</p>

<p>For three long weeks they waited.
Each day they spoke of him, and counted
the days until they should see his dear
face again. At last the time came.
They walked down to the turn in the
road to wait for his coming. Up on
the mountain side some one was walking
toward them. As he came nearer they
could see that it was the one for whom
they waited.</p>

<p>The good wife could scarcely believe
that her husband was indeed safe home
again. The baby girl laughed and
clapped her hands to see the toys he
brought her.</p>

<p>There was a tiny image of Uzume, the
laughter-loving goddess. Next came a
little red monkey of cotton, with a
blue head. When she pressed the spring
he ran to the top of the rod. Oh, how
wonderful was the third gift! It was
a <i>tombo</i>, or dragon fly. When she first
looked at it she saw only a piece of wood
shaped like a T. The cross piece was
painted with different bright colors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
But the queer thing, when her father
twirled it between his fingers, would
rise in the air, dipping and hovering
like a real dragon fly.</p>

<p>Last, of course, there was a <i>ninghio</i>,
or doll, with a sweet face, slanting eyes,
and such wonderful hair. Her name
was O-Hina-San.</p>

<p>He told of the Feast of the Dead
which he had seen in Tokio. He told
of the beautiful lanterns, the Lanterns of
the Dead; and the pine torches burning
before each house. He told of the tiny
boats made of barley straw and filled
with food that are set floating away on
the river, bearing two tiny lanterns to
guide them to the Land of the Dead.</p>

<p>At last her husband handed the wife
a small white box. "Tell me what you
see inside," he said. She opened it and
took out something round and bright.</p>

<p>On one side were buds and flowers
of frosted silver. The other side at first
looked as clear and bright as a pool of
water. When she moved it a little she
saw in it a most beautiful woman.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a beautiful picture!" she
cried. "It is of a woman and she seems
to be smiling and talking just as I am.
She has on a blue dress just like mine,
too! How strange!"</p>

<p>Then her husband laughed and said:
"That is a mirror. It is yourself you
see reflected in it. All the women in
Tokio have them."</p>

<p>The wife was delighted with her
present, and looked at it very often.
She liked to see the smiling red lips, the
laughing eyes, and beautiful dark hair.</p>

<p>After a while she said to herself:
"How foolish this is of me to sit and
gaze at myself in this mirror! I am not
more beautiful than other women. How
much better for me to enjoy others'
beauty, and forget my own face. I
shall only remember that it must always
be happy and smiling or it will make
no one else happy. I do not wish any
cross or angry look of mine to make
any one sad."</p>

<p>She put the mirror carefully away in
its box. Only twice in a year she looked
at it. Then it was to see if her face
was still such as would make others
happy.</p>

<p>The years passed by in their sweet
and simple life until the baby had
grown to be a big girl. Her <i>ninghio</i>,
her <i>tombo</i>, the image of Uzume, even
the cotton monkey, were put carefully
away for her own children.</p>

<p>This girl was the very image of her
mother. She was just as sweet and
loving, just as kind and helpful.</p>

<p>One day her mother became very ill.
Although the girl and her father did all
they could for her, she grew worse and
worse.</p>

<p>At last she knew that she must die,
so she called her daughter to her and
said: "My child, I know that I must
soon leave you, but I wish to leave
something with you in my place. Open
this box and see what you find in it."</p>

<p>The girl opened the box and looked
for the first time in a mirror. "Oh,
mother dear!" she cried. "I see you
here. Not thin and pale as you are now,
but happy and smiling, as you have
always been."</p>

<p>Then her mother said: "When I am
gone, will you look in this every morning
and every night? If anything troubles
you, tell me about it. Always try to
do right, so that you will see only happiness
here."</p>

<p>Every morning when the sun rose and
the birds began to twitter and sing, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
girl rose and looked in her mirror. There
she saw the bright, happy face that she
remembered as her mother's.</p>

<p>Every evening when the shadows fell
and the birds were asleep, she looked
again. She told it all that had happened
during the day. When it had been a
happy day the face smiled back at her.
When she was sad the face looked sad,
too. She was very careful not to do
anything unkind, for she knew how sad
the face would be then.</p>

<p>So each day she grew more kind and
loving, and more like the mother whose
face she saw each day and loved.</p>

Sparrow" is from Mrs. Williston's <i>Japanese
Fairy Tales</i>. (Copyrighted. Used by permission.)</div>


<h4><br />THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW</h4>

<div class='center'>VERSION BY TERESA PEIRCE WILLISTON</div>

<p>In a little old house in a little old
village in Japan lived a little old man
and his little old wife.</p>

<p>One morning when the old woman slid
open the screens which form the sides
of all Japanese houses, she saw, on the
doorstep, a poor little sparrow. She
took him up gently and fed him. Then
she held him in the bright morning
sunshine until the cold dew was dried
from his wings. Afterward she let him
go, so that he might fly home to his
nest, but he stayed to thank her with
his songs.</p>

<p>Each morning, when the pink on the
mountain tops told that the sun was
near, the sparrow perched on the roof
of the house and sang out his joy.</p>

<p>The old man and woman thanked the
sparrow for this, for they liked to be
up early and at work. But near them
there lived a cross old woman who did
not like to be awakened so early. At
last she became so angry that she caught
the sparrow and cut his tongue. Then
the poor little sparrow flew away to his
home, but he could never sing again.</p>

<p>When the kind woman knew what had
happened to her pet she was very sad.
She said to her husband, "Let us go and
find our poor little sparrow." So they
started together, and asked of each bird
by the wayside: "Do you know where
the Tongue-Cut Sparrow lives? Do you
know where the Tongue-Cut Sparrow
went?"</p>

<p>In this way they followed until they
came to a bridge. They did not know
which way to turn, and at first could
see no one to ask.</p>

<p>At last they saw a Bat hanging head
downward, taking his daytime nap.
"Oh, friend Bat, do you know where
the Tongue-Cut Sparrow went?" they
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Over the bridge and up the
mountain," said the Bat. Then he
blinked his sleepy eyes and was fast
asleep again.</p>

<p>They went over the bridge and up the
mountain, but again they found two
roads and did not know which one to
take. A little Field Mouse peeped
through the leaves and grass, so they
asked him, "Do you know where the
Tongue-Cut Sparrow went?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Down the mountain and
through the woods," said the Field
Mouse.</p>

<p>Down the mountain and through the
woods they went, and at last came to
the home of their little friend.</p>

<p>When he saw them coming the poor
little sparrow was very happy indeed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
He and his wife and children all came
and bowed their heads down to the
ground to show their respect. Then
the Sparrow rose and led the old
man and the old woman into his house,
while his wife and children hastened to
bring them boiled rice, fish, cress, and
sak&eacute;.</p>

<p>After they had feasted, the Sparrow
wished to please them still more, so he
danced for them what is called the
"sparrow-dance."</p>

<p>When the sun began to sink, the old
man and woman started for home. The
Sparrow brought out two baskets. "I
would like to give you one of these,"
he said. "Which will you take?" One
basket was large and looked very full,
while the other one seemed very small
and light. The old people thought they
would not take the large basket, for
that might have all the Sparrow's treasure
in it, so they said, "The way is long
and we are very old, so please let us
take the smaller one."</p>

<p>They took it and walked home over
the mountain and across the bridge,
happy and contented.</p>

<p>When they reached their own home
they decided to open the basket and see
what the Sparrow had given them.
Within the basket they found many
rolls of silk and piles of gold, enough
to make them rich, so they were more
grateful than ever to the Sparrow.</p>

<p>The cross old woman who had cut the
Sparrow's tongue was peering in through
the screen when they opened their
basket. She saw the rolls of silk and
the piles of gold, and planned how she
might get some for herself.</p>

<p>The next morning she went to the
kind woman and said: "I am so sorry
that I cut the tongue of your Sparrow.
Please tell me the way to his home so
that I may go to him and tell him I
am sorry."</p>

<p>The kind woman told her the way
and she set out. She went across the
bridge, over the mountain, and through
the woods. At last she came to the
home of the little Sparrow.</p>

<p>He was not so glad to see this old
woman, yet he was very kind to her
and did everything to make her feel
welcome. They made a feast for her,
and when she started home the Sparrow
brought out two baskets as before. Of
course the woman chose the large basket,
for she thought that would have even
more wealth than the other one.</p>

<p>It was very heavy, and caught on
the trees as she was going through the
wood. She could hardly pull it up the
mountain with her, and she was all out
of breath when she reached the top.
She did not get to the bridge until it
was dark. Then she was so afraid of
dropping the basket into the river that
she scarcely dared to step.</p>

<p>When at last she reached home she
was so tired that she was half dead, but
she pulled the screens close shut, so that
no one could look in, and opened her
treasure.</p>

<p>Treasure indeed! A whole swarm of
horrible creatures burst from the basket
the moment she opened it. They stung
her and bit her, they pushed her and
pulled her, they scratched her and
laughed at her screams.</p>

<p>At last she crawled to the edge of the
room and slid aside the screen to get
away from the pests. The moment the
door was opened they swooped down
upon her, picked her up, and flew away
with her. Since then nothing has ever
been heard of the old woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_186" id="Note_186">186</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The tale of "The Straw Ox" as given in
<i>Cossack Fairy Tales</i>, by R. Nesbit Bain, is
one of the masterpieces among folk stories.
It is of the accumulative type, winding up
rapidly to the point where the old couple
have secured, through the straw ox, all
the raw material needed for comfortable
clothing. Then comes the surprising release
of the captured animals under promise
to make contributions, each in his own
way, to the welfare of the poverty-stricken
couple. And then, the greatest surprise of
all, the quick unwinding of the plot with
the return of the grateful animals according
to promise. "And the old man was glad,
and the old woman was glad," and we are
glad for their sake, and also for the sake
of the bear and the wolf and the fox and
the hare.</div>


<h4><br />THE STRAW OX</h4>

<p>There was once upon a time an old
man and an old woman. The old man
worked in the fields as a pitch-burner,
while the old woman sat at home and
spun flax. They were so poor that
they could save nothing at all; all their
earnings went in bare food, and when
that was gone there was nothing left.
At last the old woman had a good idea:
"Look now, husband," cried she, "make
me a straw ox, and smear it all over
with tar."</p>

<p>"Why, you foolish woman!" said he,
"what's the good of an ox of that sort?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said she, "you just
make it. I know what I am about."</p>

<p>What was the poor man to do? He
set to work and made the ox of straw,
and smeared it all over with tar.</p>

<p>The night passed away, and at early
dawn the old woman took her distaff, and
drove the straw ox out into the steppe
to graze, and she herself sat down
behind a hillock, and began spinning
her flax, and cried: "Graze away, little
ox, while I spin my flax. Graze away,
little ox, while I spin my flax!"</p>

<p>And while she spun, her head drooped
down and she began to doze, and while
she was dozing, from behind the dark
wood and from the back of the huge
pines a bear came rushing out upon the
ox and said: "Who are you? Speak,
and tell me!"</p>

<p>And the ox said: "A three-year-old
heifer am I, made of straw and smeared
with tar."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the bear, "stuffed with
straw and trimmed with tar, are you?
Then give me your straw and tar, that
I may patch up my ragged fur again!"</p>

<p>"Take some," said the ox, and the
bear fell upon him and began to tear
away at the tar.</p>

<p>He tore and tore, and buried his
teeth in it till he found he couldn't
let go again. He tugged and he tugged
but it was no good, and the ox dragged
him gradually off, goodness knows where.</p>

<p>Then the old woman awoke, and there
was no ox to be seen. "Alas! old fool
that I am!" cried she, "perchance it
has gone home." Then she quickly
caught up her distaff and spinning board,
threw them over her shoulders, and
hastened off home, and she saw that
the ox had dragged the bear up to the
fence, and in she went to her old man.</p>

<p>"Dad, dad," she cried, "look, look!
The ox has brought us a bear. Come
out and kill it!" Then the old man
jumped up, tore off the bear, tied him
up, and threw him in the cellar.</p>

<p>Next morning, between dark and dawn,
the old woman took her distaff and
drove the ox into the steppe to graze.
She herself sat down by a mound, began
spinning, and said: "Graze, graze away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
little ox, while I spin my flax! Graze,
graze away, little ox, while I spin my
flax!"</p>

<p>And while she spun, her head drooped
down and she dozed. And lo! from
behind the dark wood, from the back
of the huge pines, a gray wolf came
rushing out upon the ox and said: "Who
are you? Come, tell me!"</p>

<p>"I am a three-year-old heifer, stuffed
with straw and trimmed with tar," said
the ox.</p>

<p>"Oh! trimmed with tar, are you?
Then give me of your tar to tar my
sides, that the dogs and the sons of
dogs tear me not!"</p>

<p>"Take some," said the ox. And with
that the wolf fell upon him and tried
to tear the tar off. He tugged and
tugged, and tore with his teeth, but
could get none off. Then he tried to
let go, and couldn't; tug and worry as
he might, it was no good.</p>

<p>When the old woman woke, there was
no heifer in sight. "Maybe my heifer
has gone home!" she cried. "I'll go
home and see." When she got there she
was astonished for by the paling stood
the ox with the wolf still tugging at it.
She ran and told her old man, and her
old man came and threw the wolf into
the cellar also.</p>

<p>On the third day the old woman
again drove her ox into the pastures
to graze, and sat down by a mound and
dozed off. Then a fox came running up.
"Who are you?" it asked the ox.</p>

<p>"I'm a three-year-old heifer, stuffed
with straw and daubed with tar."</p>

<p>"Then give me some of your tar to
smear my sides with, when those dogs
and sons of dogs tear my hide!"</p>

<p>"Take some," said the ox. Then the
fox fastened her teeth in him and couldn't
draw them out again. The old woman
told her old man, and he took and cast
the fox into the cellar in the same way.
And after that they caught Pussy Swiftfoot
likewise.</p>

<p>So when he had got them all safely
the old man sat down on a bench before
the cellar and began sharpening a knife.
And the bear said to him: "Tell me,
daddy, what are you sharpening your
knife for?"</p>

<p>"To flay your skin off, that I may
make a leather jacket for myself and a
pelisse for my old woman."</p>

<p>"Oh! Don't flay me, daddy dear!
Rather let me go, and I'll bring you a
lot of honey."</p>

<p>"Very well, see you do it," and he
unbound and let the bear go.</p>

<p>Then he sat down on the bench and
again began sharpening his knife. And
the wolf asked him: "Daddy, what are
you sharpening your knife for?"</p>

<p>"To flay off your skin, that I may
make me a warm cap against the winter."</p>

<p>"Oh! Don't flay me, daddy dear,
and I'll bring you a whole herd of little
sheep."</p>

<p>"Well, see that you do it," and he
let the wolf go.</p>

<p>Then he sat down, and began sharpening
his knife again. The fox put out
her little snout, and asked him: "Be
so kind, dear daddy, and tell me why
you are sharpening your knife!"</p>

<p>"Little foxes," said the old man,
"have nice skins that do capitally for
collars and trimmings, and I want to
skin you!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Don't take my skin away,
daddy dear, and I will bring you hens
and geese."</p>

<p>"Very well, see that you do it," and
he let the fox go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The hare now alone remained, and
the old man began sharpening his knife
on the hare's account.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that?" asked Puss.
He replied: "Little hares have nice
little, soft, warm skins, which will make
me nice gloves and mittens against the
winter!"</p>

<p>"Oh! daddy dear! Don't flay me,
and I'll bring you kale and good cauliflower,
if only you let me go!"</p>

<p>Then he let the hare go also.</p>

<p>Then they went to bed; but very
early in the morning, when it was
neither dusk nor dawn, there was a
noise in the doorway like "Durrrrrr!"</p>

<p>"Daddy!" cried the old woman,
"there's some one scratching at the
door; go and see who it is!"</p>

<p>The old man went out, and there
was the bear carrying a whole hive full
of honey. The old man took the honey
from the bear; but no sooner did he lie
down again than there was another
"Durrrrr!" at the door. The old man
looked out and saw the wolf driving a
whole flock of sheep into the court-yard.
Close on his heels came the fox,
driving before him the geese and hens,
and all manner of fowls; and last of all
came the hare, bringing cabbage and
kale, and all manner of good food.</p>

<p>And the old man was glad, and the
old woman was glad. And the old man
sold the sheep and oxen, and got so rich
that he needed nothing more.</p>

<p>As for the straw-stuffed ox, it stood
in the sun till it fell to pieces.</p>

<div class="hang1">"The Adventures of Connla the Comely" is
one of the romances in <i>The Book of the
Dun Cow</i>, the oldest manuscript of miscellaneous
Gaelic literature in existence.
It was made about 1100 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> and is now
preserved in the Royal Irish Academy at
Dublin. The contents were transcribed
from older books, some of the stories being
older by many centuries. The story of
Connla is "one of the many tales that illustrate
the ancient and widespread superstition
that fairies sometimes take away mortals
to their palaces in the fairy forts and
pleasant green hills." This conception is
often referred to as the Earthly Paradise
or the Isle of Youth. It is represented in
the King Arthur stories by the Vale of
Avalon to which the weeping queens carried
the king after his mortal wound in
"that last weird battle in the west." Conn
the Hundred-fighter reigned in the second
century of the Christian era (123-157 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
and this story of his son must have sprung
up soon after. According to Jacobs, it is
the oldest fairy tale of modern Europe.<br />
<br />
The following version of the tale is from
Joseph Jacobs' <i>Celtic Fairy Tales</i>, which

<h4><br />CONNLA AND THE FAIRY
MAIDEN</h4>

<p>Connla of the Fiery Hair was son of
Conn of the Hundred Fights. One day
as he stood by the side of his father on
the height of Usna, he saw a maiden clad
in strange attire towards him coming.</p>

<p>"Whence comest thou, maiden?" said
Connla.</p>

<p>"I come from the Plains of the Ever
Living," she said, "there where is neither
death nor sin. There we keep holiday
alway, nor need we help from any in our
joy. And in all our pleasure we have no
strife. And because we have our homes
in the round green hills, men call us the
Hill Folk."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The king and all with him wondered
much to hear a voice when they saw no
one. For save Connla alone, none saw
the Fairy Maiden.</p>

<p>"To whom art thou talking, my son?"
said Conn the king.</p>

<p>Then the maiden answered, "Connla
speaks to a young, fair maid, whom
neither death nor old age awaits. I love
Connla, and now I call him away to the
Plain of Pleasure, Moy Mell, where
Boadag is king for aye, nor has there
been sorrow or complaint in that land
since he held the kingship. Oh, come
with me, Connla of the Fiery Hair, ruddy
as the dawn, with thy tawny skin. A
fairy crown awaits thee to grace thy
comely face and royal form. Come, and
never shall thy comeliness fade, nor thy
youth, till the last awful day of judgment."</p>

<p>The king in fear at what the maiden
said, which he heard though he could not
see her, called aloud to his Druid, Coran
by name. "O Coran of the many
spells," he said, "and of the cunning
magic, I call upon thy aid. A task is
upon me too great for all my skill and
wit, greater than any laid upon me since
I seized the kingship. A maiden unseen
has met us, and by her power would
take from me my dear, my comely son.
If thou help not, he will be taken from thy
king by woman's wiles and witchery."</p>

<p>Then Coran the Druid stood forth and
chanted his spells towards the spot where
the maiden's voice had been heard. And
none heard her voice again, nor could
Connla see her longer. Only as she vanished
before the Druid's mighty spell, she
threw an apple to Connla.</p>

<p>For a whole month from that day
Connla would take nothing, either to eat
or to drink, save only from that apple.</p>

<p>But as he ate, it grew again and always
kept whole. And all the while there
grew within him a mighty yearning and
longing after the maiden he had seen.</p>

<p>But when the last day of the month of
waiting came, Connla stood by the side
of the king his father on the Plain of
Arcomin, and again he saw the maiden
come towards him, and again she spoke
to him. "'Tis a glorious place, forsooth,
that Connla holds among shortlived
mortals awaiting the day of death. But
now the folk of life, the ever-living ones,
beg and bid thee come to Moy Mell, the
Plain of Pleasure, for they have learnt to
know thee, seeing thee in thy home
among thy dear ones."</p>

<p>When Conn the king heard the
maiden's voice he called to his men
aloud and said: "Summon swift my
Druid Coran, for I see she has again this
day the power of speech."</p>

<p>Then the maiden said: "O mighty
Conn, Fighter of a Hundred Fights, the
Druid's power is little loved; it has little
honor in the mighty land, peopled with
so many of the upright. When the Law
comes, it will do away with the Druid's
magic spells that issue from the lips of the
false black demon."</p>

<p>Then Conn the king observed that since
the coming of the maiden Connla his son
spoke to none that spake to him. So
Conn of the Hundred Fights said to him,
"Is it to thy mind what the woman says,
my son?"</p>

<p>"'Tis hard upon me," said Connla;
"I love my own folk above all things; but
yet a longing seizes me for the maiden."</p>

<p>When the maiden heard this, she
answered and said: "The ocean is not
so strong as the waves of thy longing.
Come with me in my curragh, the gleaming,
straight-gliding crystal canoe. Soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
can we reach Boadag's realm. I see the
bright sun sink, yet far as it is, we can
reach it before dark. There is, too,
another land worthy of thy journey, a
land joyous to all that seek it. Only
wives and maidens dwell there. If thou
wilt, we can seek it and live there alone
together in joy."</p>

<p>When the maiden ceased to speak,
Connla of the Fiery Hair rushed away
from his kinsmen and sprang into the
curragh, the gleaming, straight-gliding
crystal canoe. And then they all, king
and court, saw it glide away over the
bright sea towards the setting sun, away
and away, till eye could see it no longer.
So Connla and the Fairy Maiden went
forth on the sea, and were no more seen,
nor did any know whither they went.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_188" id="Note_188">188</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">One of the best of the volumes of Irish tales
is Lady Wilde's <i>Ancient Legends of Ireland</i>,
and one of the best stories in that volume
is her version of the witch story of "The
Horned Women." The story is compact
and restrained in the telling, and carries
effectively to the listener the "creepy"
spell of the witches. The way in which
the house was prepared against the enchantments
of the returning witches furnishes
a good illustration of some of the deep-seated
superstitions of the folk.</div>


<h4><br />THE HORNED WOMEN</h4>

<p>A rich woman sat up late one night
carding and preparing wool, while all
the family and servants were asleep.
Suddenly a knock was given at the door,
and a voice called, "Open! Open!"</p>

<p>"Who is there?" said the woman of
the house.</p>

<p>"I am the Witch of the one Horn,"
was answered.</p>

<p>The mistress, supposing that one of
her neighbors had called and required
assistance, opened the door, and a woman
entered, having in her hand a pair of
wool carders, and bearing a horn on her
forehead, as if growing there. She sat
down by the fire in silence, and began
to card the wool with violent haste.
Suddenly she paused, and said aloud:
"Where are the women; they delay
too long."</p>

<p>Then a second knock came to the
door, and a voice called as before,
"Open! Open!"</p>

<p>The mistress felt herself constrained
to rise and open to the call, and immediately
a second witch entered, having
two horns on her forehead, and in her
hand a wheel for spinning wool.</p>

<p>"Give me place," she said, "I am the
Witch of the two Horns"; and she
began to spin as quick as lightning.</p>

<p>And so the knocks went on, and the
call was heard, and the witches entered,
until at last, twelve women sat round
the fire&mdash;the first with one horn, the
last with twelve horns.</p>

<p>And they carded the thread, and turned
their spinning wheels, and wound and
wove.</p>

<p>All were singing together an ancient
rhyme, but no word did they speak to
the mistress of the house. Strange to
hear and frightful to look upon were
these twelve women, with their horns
and their wheels; and the mistress felt
near to death, and she tried to rise that
she might call for help, but she could
not move, nor could she utter a word or
a cry, for the spell of the witches was
upon her.</p>

<p>Then one of them called to her in
Irish, and said, "Rise, woman, and make
us a cake." Then the mistress searched
for a vessel to bring water from the well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that she might mix the meal and make
the cake, but she could find none.</p>

<p>And they said to her, "Take a sieve,
and bring water in it." And she took
the sieve and went to the well; but the
water poured from it, and she could
fetch none for the cake, and she sat
down by the well and wept.</p>

<p>Then came a voice by her, and said,
"Take yellow clay and moss and bind
them together, and plaster the sieve so
that it will hold."</p>

<p>This she did, and the sieve held the
water for the cake; and the voice said
again: "Return, and when thou comest
to the north angle of the house cry
aloud three times, and say, 'The mountain
of the Fenian women and the sky
over it is all on fire.'"</p>

<p>And she did so.</p>

<p>When the witches inside heard the call,
a great and terrible cry broke from their
lips, and they rushed forth with wild
lamentations and shrieks, and fled away
to Slievenamon, where was their chief
abode. But the Spirit of the Well bade
the mistress of the house to enter and
prepare her home against the enchantments
of the witches, if they returned
again.</p>

<p>And first, to break their spells, she
sprinkled the water in which she had
washed her child's feet (the feet-water)
outside the door on the threshold;
secondly, she took the cake which the
witches had made in her absence, of
meal mixed with the blood drawn from
the sleeping family, and she broke the
cake in bits, and placed a bit in the
mouth of each sleeper, and they were
restored; and she took the cloth they
had woven, and placed it half in and
half out of the chest with the padlock;
and, lastly, she secured the door with a
great crossbeam fastened in the jambs,
so that they could not enter, and having
done these things she waited.</p>

<p>Not long were the witches in coming,
and they raged and called for vengeance.</p>

<p>"Open! Open!" they screamed.
"Open, feet-water!"</p>

<p>"I cannot," said the feet-water; "I
am scattered on the ground, and my
path is down to the Lough."</p>

<p>"Open, open, wood and trees and
beam!" they cried to the door.</p>

<p>"I cannot," said the door, "for the
beam is fixed in the jambs, and I have
no power to move."</p>

<p>"Open, open, cake that we have made
and mingled with blood!" they cried
again.</p>

<p>"I cannot," said the cake, "for I am
broken and bruised, and my blood is
on the lips of the sleeping children."</p>

<p>Then the witches rushed through the
air with great cries, and fled back to
Slievenamon, uttering strange curses on
the Spirit of the Well, who had wished
their ruin. But the woman and the
house were left in peace, and a mantle
dropped by one of the witches was kept
hung up by the mistress as a sign of the
night's awful contest; and this mantle
was in possession of the same family
from generation to generation for five
hundred years after.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_189" id="Note_189">189</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The story of "King O'Toole and His Goose"
is from Samuel Lover's <i>Stories and Legends
of the Irish Peasantry</i>, as reprinted in
slightly abridged form in William Butler
Yeats's <i>Irish Fairy Tales</i>. The extreme
form of the dialect is kept as in the original,
since the humor is largely dependent on
the language of the peasant who tells the
story. It will serve as a good illustration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
for practice work for the amateur story-teller.
Probably most teachers would find
it necessary to "reduce" this dialect or to
eliminate it altogether. Mr. Jacobs, who
includes this story in his <i>Celtic Fairy Tales</i>,
reduces the dialect very materially, keeping
just enough to remind one that it is Irish.
He also says the final word as to the moral
of the story: "This is a moral apologue
on the benefits of keeping your word. Yet
it is told with such humor and vigor, that
the moral glides insensibly into the
heart."</div>


<h4><br />KING O'TOOLE AND HIS GOOSE</h4>

<p>"By Gor, I thought all the world, far
and near, heerd o' King O'Toole&mdash;well,
well, but the darkness of mankind is
ontellible! Well, sir, you must know,
as you didn't hear it afore, that there
was a king, called King O'Toole, who
was a fine ould king in the ould ancient
times, long ago; and it was him that
owned the churches in the early days.
The king, you see, was the right sort;
he was the rale boy, and loved sport as
he loved his life, and huntin' in partic'lar;
and from the risin' o' the sun, up he
got, and away he wint over the mountains
beyant afther the deer; and the
fine times them wor.</p>

<p>"Well, it was all mighty good, as
long as the king had his health; but,
you see, in coorse of time the king grew
ould, by raison he was stiff in his limbs,
and when he got sthriken in years, his
heart failed him, and he was lost intirely
for want o' divarshin, bekase he couldn't
go a huntin' no longer; and, by dad,
the poor king was obleeged at last for
to get a goose to divart him. Oh, you
may laugh, if you like, but it's truth
I'm tellin' you; and the way the goose
divarted him was this-a-way: You see,
the goose used for to swim across the
lake, and go divin' for throut, and cotch
fish on a Friday for the king, and flew
every other day round about the lake,
divartin' the poor king. All went on
mighty well, antil, by dad, the goose
got sthriken in years like her master,
and couldn't divart him no longer, and
then it was that the poor king was lost
complate. The king was walkin' one
mornin' by the edge of the lake, lamentin'
his cruel fate, and thinkin' o' drownin'
himself, that could get no divarshun in
life, when all of a suddint, turnin' round
the corner beyant, who should he meet
but a mighty dacent young man comin'
up to him.</p>

<p>"'God save you,' says the king to
the young man.</p>

<p>"'God save you kindly, King O'Toole,'
says the young man. 'Thrue for you,'
says the king. 'I am King O'Toole,'
says he, 'prince and plennypennytinchery
o' these parts,' says he; 'but how kem
ye to know that?' says he. 'Oh, never
mind,' says Saint Kavin.</p>

<p>"You see it was Saint Kavin, sure
enough&mdash;the saint himself in disguise,
and nobody else. 'Oh, never mind,'
says he, 'I know more than that. May
I make bowld to ax how is your goose,
King O'Toole?' says he. 'Bluran-agers,
how kem ye to know about my goose?'
says the king. 'Oh, no matther; I was
given to understand it,' says Saint Kavin.
After some more talk the king says,
'What are you?' 'I'm an honest man,'
says Saint Kavin. 'Well, honest man,'
says the king, 'and how is it you make
your money so aisy?' 'By makin' ould
things as good as new,' says Saint Kavin.
'Is it a tinker you are?' says the king.
'No,' says the saint; 'I'm no tinker by
thrade, King O'Toole; I've a betther
thrade than a tinker,' says he&mdash;'what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
would you say,' says he, 'if I made your
ould goose as good as new?'</p>

<p>"My dear, at the word o' makin' his
goose as good as new, you'd think the
poor ould king's eyes was ready to
jump out iv his head. With that the
king whistled, and down kem the poor
goose, all as one as a hound, waddlin'
up to the poor cripple, her masther, and
as like him as two pays. The minute
the saint clapt his eyes on the goose,
'I'll do the job for you,' says he, 'King
O'Toole.' 'By <i>Jaminee!</i>' says King
O'Toole, 'if you do, but I'll say you're
the cleverest fellow in the sivin parishes.'
'Oh, by dad,' says Saint Kavin, 'you must
say more nor that&mdash;my horn's not so
soft all out,' says he, 'as to repair your
ould goose for nothin'; what'll you gi'
me if I do the job for you?&mdash;that's the
chat,' says Saint Kavin. 'I'll give you
whatever you ax,' says the king; 'isn't
that fair?' 'Divil a fairer,' says the
saint; 'that's the way to do business.
Now,' says he, 'this is the bargain I'll
make with you, King O'Toole: will
you gi' me all the ground the goose
flies over, the first offer, afther I make
her as good as new?' 'I will,' says the
king, 'You won't go back o' your
word?' says Saint Kavin. 'Honor bright!'
says King O'Toole, howldin' out his
fist. 'Honor bright!' says Saint Kavin,
back agin, 'it's a bargain. Come here!'
says he to the poor ould goose&mdash;'come
here, you unfort'nate ould cripple, and
it's I that'll make you the sportin' bird.'
With that, my dear, he took up the goose
by the two wings&mdash;'Criss o' my crass
and you,' says he, markin' her to grace
with the blessed sign at the same minute&mdash;and
throwin' her up in the air, 'whew,'
says he, jist givin' her a blast to help
her; and with that, my jewel, she tuk
to her heels, flyin' like one o' the aigles
themselves and cuttin' as many capers
as a swallow before a shower of rain.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, it was a beautiful
sight to see the king standin' with his
mouth open, lookin' at his poor ould
goose flyin' as light as a lark, and betther
nor ever she was: and when she lit at
his fut, patter her an the head, and,
'<i>Ma vourneen</i>,' says he, 'but you are
the <i>darlint</i> o' the world.' 'And what
do you say to me,' says Saint Kavin,
'for makin' her the like?' 'By gor,'
says the king, 'I say nothin' bates the
art o' man, barrin' the bees.' 'And do
you say no more nor that?' says Saint
Kavin. 'And that I'm behoulden to
you,' says the king. 'But will you give
me all the ground the goose flew over?'
says Saint Kavin. 'I will,' says King
O'Toole, 'and you're welkim to it,' says
he, 'though it's the last acre I have to
give.' 'But you'll keep your word
thrue?' says the saint. 'As thrue as
the sun,' says the king. 'It's well for
you, King O'Toole, that you said that
word,' says he; 'for if you didn't say
that word, <i>the devil receave the bit o' your
goose id ever fly agin</i>.'</p>

<p>"Whin the king was as good as his
word, Saint Kavin was <i>plazed</i> with him,
and thin it was that he made himself
known to the king. 'And,' says he,
'King O'Toole, you're a dacent man,
for I only kem here to <i>thry you</i>. You
don't know me,' says he, 'bekase I'm
disguised.' 'Musha! thin,' says the king,
'who are you?' 'I'm Saint Kavin,'
said the Saint, blessin' himself. 'Oh,
queen iv heaven!' says the king makin'
the sign o' the crass betune his eyes,
and fallin' down on his knees before the
saint; 'is it the great Saint Kavin,'
says he, 'that I've been discoorsin' all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
this time without knowin' it,' says he,
'all as one as if he was a lump iv a <i>gosson?</i>&mdash;and
so you're a saint?' says the king.
'I am,' says Saint Kavin. 'By gor, I
thought I was only talking to a dacent
boy,' says the king. 'Well, you know
the differ now,' says the saint. 'I'm
Saint Kavin,' says he, 'the greatest of
all the saints.'</p>

<p>"And so the king had his goose as
good as new, to divart him as long as
he lived: and the saint supported him
afther he kem into his property, as I
tould you, until the day iv his death&mdash;and
that was soon afther; for the poor
goose thought he was ketchin' a throut
one Friday; but, my jewel, it was a
mistake he made&mdash;and instead of a
throut, it was a thievin' horse-eel; and
by gor, instead iv the goose killin' a
throut for the king's supper,&mdash;by dad,
the eel killed the king's goose&mdash;and
small blame to him; but he didn't
ate her, bekase he darn't ate what
Saint Kavin had laid his blessed hands
on."</p>

<h2>SECTION IV: FAIRY STORIES&mdash;MODERN FANTASTIC TALES</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>

<p>The difficulties of classification are very apparent here, and once more it must
be noted that illustrative and practical purposes rather than logical ones are served
by the arrangement adopted. The modern fanciful story is here placed next to the
real folk story instead of after all the groups of folk products. The Hebrew stories
at the beginning belong quite as well, perhaps even better, in <a href="#Page_261">Section V</a>, while the
stories at the end of <a href="#Page_301">Section VI</a> shade off into the more modern types of short tales.
Then the fact that other groups of modern stories are to follow later, illustrating
more realistic studies of life and the very recent and remarkably numerous writings
centering around animal life, limits the list here. Many of the animal stories might,
with equal propriety, be placed under the head of the fantastic.</p>

<p><i>The child's natural literature.</i> The world has lost certain secrets as the price
of an advancing civilization. It is a commonplace of observation that no one can
duplicate the success of Mother Goose, whether she be thought of as the maker of
jingles or the teller of tales. The conditions of modern life preclude the generally
na&iuml;ve attitude that produced the folk rhymes, ballads, tales, proverbs, fables, and
myths. The folk saw things simply and directly. The complex, analytic, questioning
mind is not yet, either in or out of stories. The motives from which people act
are to them plain and not mixed. Characters are good or bad. They feel no need
of elaborately explaining their joys and sorrows. Such experiences come with the
day's work. "To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new." The zest of life with
them is emphatic. Their humor is fresh, unbounded, sincere; there is no trace of
cynicism. In folk literature we do not feel the presence of a "writer" who is mightily
concerned about maintaining his reputation for wisdom, originality, or style. Hence
the freedom from any note of straining after effect, of artificiality. In the midst of a
life limited to fundamental needs, their literature deals with fundamentals. On the
whole, it was a literature for entertainment. A more learned upper class may have
concerned itself then about "problems" and "purposes," as the whole world does
now, but the literature of the folk had no such interests.</p>

<p>Without discussing the limits of the culture-epoch theory of human development
as a complete guide in education, it is clear that the young child passes through a
period when his mind looks out upon the world in a manner analogous to that of the
folk as expressed in their literature. Quarrel with the fact as we may, it still remains
a fact that his nature craves these old stories and will not be satisfied with something
"just as good."</p>

<p><i>The modern fairy story.</i> The advance of civilization has been accompanied by
a wistful longing for the simplicities left by the way. In some periods this interest
in the past has been more marked than in others. When the machinery of life has
weighed too heavily on the human spirit, men have turned for relief to a contemplation
of the "good old times" and have preached crusades of a "return to nature."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Many modern writers have tried to recapture some of the power of the folk tale by
imitating its method. In many cases they have had a fair degree of success: in one
case, that of Hans Christian Andersen, the success is admittedly very complete. As
a rule, however, the sharpness of the sense of wonder has been blunted, and many
imitators of the old fairy tale succeed in keeping only the shell. Another class of
modern fantastic tale is that of the <i>pourquoi</i> story, which has the explanation of something
as its object. Such tales grow out of the attempt to use the charm of old stories
as a means of conveying instruction, somewhat after the method of those parents
who covered up our bitter medicine with some of our favorite jam. Even "Little
Red Riding Hood," as we saw, has been turned into a flower myth. So compelling
is this pedagogical motive that so-called nature myths have been invented or made
from existing stories in great numbers. The practical results please many teachers,
but it may be questioned whether the gain is sufficient to compensate children for
the distorting results upon masterpieces.</p>

<p><i>Wide range of the modern fairy tale.</i> The bibliography will suggest something
of the treasures in the field of the modern fanciful story. From the delightful nonsense
of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> and the "travelers' tales" of <i>Baron Munchausen</i> to the
profound seriousness of <i>The King of the Golden River</i> and <i>Why the Chimes Rang</i> is a
far cry. There are the rich fancies of Barrie and Maeterlinck, at the same time
delicate as the promises of spring and brilliant as the fruitions of summer. One may
be blown away to the land of Oz, he may lose his shadow with Peter Schlemihl, he
may outdo the magic carpet with his Traveling-Cloak, he may visit the courts of
kings with his Wonderful Chair; Miss Muffet will invite us to her Christmas party,
Lemuel Gulliver will lead us to lands not marked in the school atlas; on every side
is a world of wonder.</p>

<p><i>Some qualities of these modern tales.</i> Every age produces after its own fashion,
and we must expect to find the modern user of the fairy-story method expressing
through it the qualities of his own outlook upon the world. Interest in the picturesque
aspects of landscape will be emphasized, as in the early portions of "The
Story of Fairyfoot" and, with especial magnificence of style, throughout <i>The King
of the Golden River</i>. There will appear the saddened mood of the modern in the
face of the human miseries that make happiness a mockery, as in "The Happy
Prince." The destructive effects of the possessive instinct upon all that is finest
in human nature is reflected in "The Prince's Dream." That the most valuable
efforts are often those performed with least spectacular settings may be discerned
in "The Knights of the Silver Shield," while the lesson of kindly helpfulness is the
burden of "Old Pipes and the Dryad." In many modern stories the reader is too
much aware of the conscious efforts of style and structure. The thoughtful child
will sometimes be too much distressed by the more somber modern story, and should
not hear too many of the gloomy type.</p>

<p><i>Andersen the consummate master.</i> Hans Christian Andersen is the acknowledged
master of the modern story for children. What are the sources of his success? Genius
is always unexplainable except in terms of itself, but some things are clear. To
begin, he makes a mark&mdash;drives down a peg: "There came a soldier marching along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the high road&mdash;<i>one, two! one, two!</i>" and you are off. No backing and filling, no
jockeying for position, no elaborate setting of the stage. The story's the thing!
Next, the language is the language of common oral speech, free and unrestrained.
The rigid forms of the grammar are eschewed. There is no beating around the bush.
Seeing through the eyes of the child, he uses the language that is natural to such sight:
"Aha! there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels." In quick dramatic fashion
the story unrolls before your vision: "So the soldier cut the witch's head off. There
she lay!" No agonizing over the cruelty of it, the lack of sympathy. It is a joke
after the child's own heart, and with a hearty laugh at this end to an impostor, the
listener is on with the story. The logic is the logic of childhood: "And everyone
could see she was a real princess, for she was so lovely." When Andersen deals with
some of the deeper truths of existence, as in "The Nightingale" or "The Ugly Duckling,"
he still manages to throw it all into the form that is natural and convincing
and simple to the child. He never mounts a pedestal and becomes a grown-up philosopher.
Perhaps Andersen's secret lay in the fact that some fairy godmother invested
him at birth with a power to see things so completely as a child sees them that he
never questioned the dignity of the method. In few of his stories is there any evidence
of a constraint due to a conscious attempt to write down to the understandings of
children.</p>


<h3><br />SUGGESTIONS FOR READING</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The most valuable discussion of the difficulties to be mastered in writing the literary fairy
tale, and the story of the only very complete mastery yet made, will be found in the account of Hans
Christian Andersen in <i>Eminent Authors of the Nineteenth Century</i>, by Georg Brandes. Now and
then hints of importance on such stories and their value for children may be found in biographies
of the more prominent writers represented in the section and mentioned in the bibliography, and
in magazine articles and reviews. These latter may be located by use of the periodical indexes
found in most libraries. For the proper attitude which the schools should have toward fiction and
fanciful writing in general, nothing could be better than two lectures on "Children's Reading," in
<i>On the Art of Reading</i>, by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_190" id="Note_190">190</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The rabbis of old were good story-tellers.
They were essentially teachers and they
understood that the best sermon is a
story. "They were fond of the parable,
the anecdote, the apt illustration, and their
legends that have been transmitted to us,
all aglow with the light and life of the
Orient, possess perennial charm." It is
possible to find in rabbinical sources a
large number of brief stories that have the
power of entertaining as well as of emphasizing
some qualities of character that are
important in all ages. The plan of this
book does not include the wonderful stories
of the Old Testament, which are easy of
access to any teacher and may be used as
experience directs. The Hebrew stories
following correspond very nearly to the
folk anecdote and are placed in this section
because of their literary form.</div>
<div class="hang1">
Dr. Abram S. Isaacs (1851&mdash;) is a professor
in New York University and is also a rabbi.
The selection that follows is from his
<i>Stories from the Rabbis</i>. (Copyrighted.
Used by special permission of The Bloch
Publishing Company, New York.) Taking
advantage of the popular superstition that
a four-leaved clover is a sign of good luck,
Dr. Isaacs has grouped together four
parable-like stories, each of which deals
with wealth as a subject. The editors are
responsible for the special titles given.
The messages of these stories might be
summarized as follows: If you would be
lucky, (1) be honest because it is right to
be honest, (2) value good friends more
highly than gold, (3) let love accompany
each gift of charity, and (4) use common
sense in your business ventures.</div>


<h4><br />A FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER</h4>

<div class='center'>ABRAM S. ISAACS<br />
<br />
1. <span class="smcap">The Rabbi and The Diadem</span></div>

<p>Great was the alarm in the palace of
Rome, which soon spread throughout
the entire city. The Empress had lost
her costly diadem, and it could not be
found. They searched in every direction,
but it was all in vain. Half distracted,
for the mishap boded no good to
her or her house, the Empress redoubled
her exertions to regain her precious
possession, but without result. As a
last resource it was proclaimed in the
public streets:</p>

<p>"The Empress has lost a priceless
diadem. Whoever restores it within
thirty days shall receive a princely
reward. But he who delays, and brings
it after thirty days, shall lose his head."</p>

<p>In those times all nationalities flocked
toward Rome; all classes and creeds
could be met in its stately halls and
crowded thoroughfares. Among the rest
was a rabbi, a learn&egrave;d sage from the
East, who loved goodness and lived a
righteous life, in the stir and turmoil
of the Western world. It chanced one
night as he was strolling up and down,
in busy meditation, beneath the clear,
moonlit sky, he saw the diadem sparkling
at his feet. He seized it quickly,
brought it to his dwelling, where he
guarded it carefully until the thirty
days had expired, when he resolved to
return it to the owner.</p>

<p>He proceeded to the palace, and,
undismayed at sight of long lines of
soldiery and officials, asked for an audience
with the Empress.</p>

<p>"What dost thou mean by this?"
she inquired, when he told her his story
and gave her the diadem. "Why didst
thou delay until this hour? Dost thou
know the penalty? Thy head must be
forfeited."</p>

<p>"I delayed until now," the rabbi
answered calmly, "so that thou mightst
know that I return thy diadem, not for
the sake of the reward, still less out of
fear of punishment; but solely to comply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with the Divine command not to withhold
from another the property which
belongs to him."</p>

<p>"Blessed be thy God!" the Empress
answered, and dismissed the rabbi without
further reproof; for had he not
done right for right's sake?</p>


<div class='center'><br />2. <span class="smcap">Friendship</span></div>

<p>A certain father was doubly blessed&mdash;he
had reached a good old age, and had
ten sons. One day he called them to
his side, and after repeated expressions
of affection, told them that he had
acquired a fortune by industry and
economy, and would give them one
hundred gold pieces each before his
death, so that they might begin business
for themselves, and not be obliged to
wait until he had passed away. It
happened, however, that, soon after, he
lost a portion of his property, much to
his regret, and had only nine hundred
and fifty gold pieces left. So he gave
one hundred to each of his nine sons.
When his youngest son, whom he loved
most of all, asked naturally what was
to be his share, the father replied:</p>

<p>"My son, I promised to give each of
thy brothers one hundred gold pieces.
I shall keep my word to them. I have
fifty left. Thirty I shall reserve for my
funeral expenses, and twenty will be
thy portion. But understand this&mdash;I
possess, in addition, ten friends, whom I
give over to thee as compensation for
the loss of the eighty gold pieces. Believe
me, they are worth more than all the gold
and silver."</p>

<p>The youth tenderly embraced his
parent, and assured him that he was
content, such was his confidence and
affection. In a few days the father
died, and the nine sons took their
money, and without a thought of their
youngest brother and the small amount
he had received, followed each his own
fancy. But the youngest son, although
his portion was the least, resolved to
heed his father's words, and hold fast
to the ten friends. When a short time
had elapsed he prepared a simple feast,
went to the ten friends of his father,
and said to them: "My father, almost
in his last words, asked me to keep
you, his friends, in honor. Before I
leave this place to seek my fortune elsewhere,
will you not share with me a
farewell meal, and aid me thus to comply
with his dying request?"</p>

<p>The ten friends, stirred by his earnestness
and cordiality, accepted his invitation
with pleasure, and enjoyed the
repast, although they were used to
richer fare. When the moment for
parting arrived, however, one of them
rose and spoke: "My friends, it seems
to me that of all the sons of our dear
friend that has gone, the youngest alone
is mindful of his father's friendship for
us, and reverences his memory. Let
us, then, be true friends to him, for his
own sake as well, and provide for him
a generous sum, that he may begin
business here, and not be forced to live
among strangers."</p>

<p>The proposal, so unexpected and yet
so merited, was received with applause.
The youth, proud of their friendship,
soon became a prosperous merchant,
who never forgot that faithful friends
were more valuable than gold or
silver, and left an honored name to his
descendants.</p>


<div class='center'><br />3. <span class="smcap">True Charity</span></div>

<p>There lived once a very wealthy man,
who cared little for money, except as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a means for helping others. He used
to adopt a peculiar plan in his method
of charitable relief. He had three boxes
made for the three different classes of
people whom he desired to assist. In
one box he put gold pieces, which he
distributed among artists and scholars,
for he honored knowledge and learning
as the highest possession. In the second
box he placed silver pieces for widows
and orphans, for whom his sympathies
were readily awakened. In the third
were copper coins for the general poor
and beggars&mdash;no one was turned away
from his dwelling without some gift,
however small.</p>

<p>That the man was beloved by all,
need hardly be said. He rejoiced that
he was enabled to do so much good,
retained his modest bearing, and continued
to regard his wealth as only an
incentive to promote the happiness of
mankind, without distinction of creed
or nationality. Unhappily, his wife was
just the opposite. She rarely gave food
or raiment to the poor, and felt angry
at her husband's liberality, which she
considered shameless extravagance.</p>

<p>The day came when in the pressure
of various duties he had to leave his
house, and could not return until the
morrow. Unaware of his sudden departure,
the poor knocked at the door as
usual for his kind gifts; but when they
found him absent, they were about to
go away or remain in the street, being
terrified at the thought of asking his
wife for alms. Vexed at their conduct,
she exclaimed impetuously: "I will give
to the poor according to my husband's
method."</p>

<p>She seized the keys of the boxes, and
first opened the box of gold. But how
great was her terror when she gazed at
its contents&mdash;frogs jumping here and
there. Then she went to the silver
box, and it was full of ants. With
troubled heart, she opened the copper
box, and it was crowded with creeping
bugs. Loud then were her complaints,
and bitter her tears, at the deception,
and she kept her room until her husband
returned.</p>

<p>No sooner did the man enter the room,
annoyed that so many poor people were
kept waiting outside, than she asked
him: "Why did you give me keys to
boxes of frogs, ants, and bugs, instead
of gold, silver, and copper? Was it
right thus to deceive your wife, and
disappoint the poor?"</p>

<p>"Not so," rejoined her husband.
"The mistake must be yours, not mine.
I have given you the right keys. I do
not know what you have done with them.
Come, let me have them. I am guiltless
of any deception." He took the
keys, quickly opened the boxes, and
found the coins as he had left them.
"Ah, dear wife," said he, when she had
regained her composure, "your heart, I
fear, was not in the gift, when you wished
to give to the poor. It is the feeling that
prompts us to aid, not the mere money,
which is the chief thing after all."</p>

<p>And ever after, her heart was changed.
Her gifts blessed the poor of the land,
and aroused their love and reverence.</p>


<div class='center'><br />4. <span class="smcap">An Eastern Garden</span></div>

<p>In an Eastern city a lovely garden
flourished, whose beauty and luxuriance
awakened much admiration. It was
the owner's greatest pleasure to watch
its growth, as leaf, flower, and tree
seemed daily to unfold to brighter
bloom. One morning, while taking his
usual stroll through the well-kept paths,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he was surprised to find that some
blossoms were picked to pieces. The
next day he noticed more signs of mischief,
and rendered thus more observant
he gave himself no rest until he had
discovered the culprit. It was a little
trembling bird, whom he managed to
capture, and was about to kill in his
anger, when it exclaimed: "Do not
kill me, I beg you, kind sir. I am only
a wee, tiny bird. My flesh is too little
to satisfy you. I would not furnish
one-hundredth of a meal to a man of
your size. Let me free without any
hesitation, and I shall teach you something
that will be of much use to you
and your friends."</p>

<p>"I would dearly like to put an end to
you," replied the man, "for you were
rapidly putting an end to my garden.
It is a good thing to rid the world of
such annoyances. But as I am not
revengeful, and am always glad to learn
something useful, I shall set you free
this time." And he opened his hand
to give the bird more air.</p>

<p>"Attention!" cried the bird. "Here
are three rules which should guide you
through life, and if you observe them
you will find your path made easier:
Do not cry over spilt milk; do not desire
what is unattainable, and do not believe
what is impossible."</p>

<p>The man was satisfied with the advice,
and let the bird escape; but it had
scarcely regained its liberty, when, from
a high tree opposite, it exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What a silly man! The idea of letting
me escape! If you only knew what
you have lost! But it is too late now."</p>

<p>"What have I lost?" the man asked,
angrily.</p>

<p>"Why, if you had killed me, as you
intended, you would have found inside
of me a huge pearl, as large as a goose's
egg, and you would have been a wealthy
man forever."</p>

<p>"Dear little bird," the man said in
his blandest tones; "sweet little bird, I
will not harm you. Only come down to
me, and I will treat you as if you were
my own child, and give you fruit and
flowers all day. I assure you of this
most sacredly."</p>

<p>But the bird shook its head sagely,
and replied: "What a silly man, to
forget so soon the advice which was
given him in all seriousness. I told you
not to cry over spilt milk, and here you
are, worrying over what has happened.
I urged you not to desire the unattainable,
and now you wish to capture me
again. And, finally, I asked you not
to believe what is impossible, and you
are rashly imagining that I have a huge
pearl inside of me, when a goose's egg
is larger than my whole body. You
ought to learn your lessons better in
the future, if you would become wise,"
added the bird, as with another twist of
its head it flew away, and was lost in
the distance.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_191" id="Note_191">191</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">A classic collection of short stories from the
ancient Hebrew sages is the little book,
<i>Hebrew Tales</i>, published in London in 1826
by the noted Jewish scholar Hyman Hurwitz
(1770-1844). A modern handy edition
of this book (about sixty tales) is published
as Vol. II of the Library of Jewish Classics.
Of special interest is the fact that it contained
three stories by the poet Samuel
Taylor Coleridge, who had published them
first in his periodical, <i>The Friend</i>. Coleridge
was much interested in Hebrew
literature, and especially fond of speaking
in parables, as those who know "The
Ancient Mariner" will readily recall. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
following is one of the three stories referred
to, and it had prefixed to it the significant
text, "The Lord helpeth man and beast."
(Psalm XXXVI, 6.)</div>


<h4><br />THE LORD HELPETH MAN
AND BEAST</h4>

<div class='center'>SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE</div>

<p>During his march to conquer the world,
Alexander, the Macedonian, came to a
people in Africa who dwelt in a remote
and secluded corner, in peaceful huts,
and knew neither war nor conqueror.
They led him to the hut of their chief,
who received him hospitably, and placed
before him golden dates, golden figs, and
bread of gold.</p>

<p>"Do you eat gold in this country?"
said Alexander.</p>

<p>"I take it for granted," replied the
chief, "that thou wert able to find
eatable food in thine own country.
For what reason, then, art thou come
amongst us?"</p>

<p>"Your gold has not tempted me
hither," said Alexander, "but I would
become acquainted with your manners
and customs."</p>

<p>"So be it," rejoined the other:
"sojourn among us as long as it pleaseth
thee."</p>

<p>At the close of this conversation, two
citizens entered, as into their court of
justice. The plaintiff said, "I bought
of this man a piece of land, and as I
was making a deep drain through it,
I found a treasure. This is not mine,
for I only bargained for the land, and
not for any treasure that might be concealed
beneath it; and yet the former
owner of the land will not receive it."
The defendant answered, "I hope I have
a conscience, as well as my fellow citizen.
I sold him the land with all its contingent,
as well as existing advantages, and
consequently, the treasure inclusively."</p>

<p>The chief, who was at the same time
their supreme judge, recapitulated their
words, in order that the parties might
see whether or not he understood them
aright. Then, after some reflection, said:
"Thou hast a son, friend, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And thou," addressing the other, "a
daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let thy son marry <i>thy</i>
daughter, and bestow the treasure on
the young couple for a marriage portion."
Alexander seemed surprised and perplexed.
"Think you my sentence
unjust?" the chief asked him.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" replied Alexander; "but it
astonishes me."</p>

<p>"And how, then," rejoined the chief,
"would the case have been decided in
your country?"</p>

<p>"To confess the truth," said Alexander,
"we should have taken both parties into
custody, and have seized the treasure
for the king's use."</p>

<p>"For the king's use!" exclaimed the
chief; "does the sun shine on that
country?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"Does it rain there?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly."</p>

<p>"Wonderful! But are there tame
animals in the country, that live on the
grass and green herbs?"</p>

<p>"Very many, and of many kinds."</p>

<p>"Ay, that must, then, be the cause,"
said the chief: "for the sake of those
innocent animals the All-gracious Being
continues to let the sun shine, and the
rain drop down on your country; since
its inhabitants are unworthy of such
blessings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>"</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_192" id="Note_192">192</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">By almost common consent Hans Christian
Andersen (1805-1875), the Danish author,
is the acknowledged master of all modern
writers of fairy tales. He was born in
poverty, the son of a poor shoemaker.
With a naturally keen dramatic sense, his
imagination was stirred by stories from
the <i>Arabian Nights</i> and La Fontaine's
<i>Fables</i>, by French and Spanish soldiers
marching through his native city, and by
listening to the wonderful folk tales of his
country. On a toy stage and with toy
actors, these vivid impressions took actual
form. The world continued a dramatic
spectacle to him throughout his existence.
His consuming ambition was for the stage,
but he had none of the personal graces so
necessary for success. He was ungainly
and awkward, like his "ugly duckling."
But when at last he began to write, he had
the power to transfer to the page the vivid
dramas in his mind, and this power culminated
in the creation of fairy stories for
children which he began to publish in 1835.
It is usual to say that Andersen, like Peter
Pan, "never grew up," and it is certain
that he never lost the power of seeing
things as children see them. Like many
great writers whose fame now rests on the
suffrages of child readers, Andersen seems
at first to have felt that the <i>Tales</i> were
slight and beneath his dignity. They are
not all of the same high quality. Occasionally
one of them becomes "too sentimental
and sickly sweet," but the best of
them have a sturdiness that is thoroughly
refreshing.</div>
<div class="hang1">
The most acute analysis of the elements of
Andersen's greatness as the ideal writer
for children is that made by his fellow-countryman
Georg Brandes in <i>Eminent
Authors of the Nineteenth Century</i>. A
briefer account on similar lines will be
found in H. J. Boyesen's <i>Scandinavian
Literature</i>. A still briefer account,
eminently satisfactory for an introduction to
Andersen, by Benjamin W. Wells, is in
Warner's <i>Library of the World's Best
Literature</i>. The interested student cannot,
of course, afford to neglect Andersen's
own <i>The Story of My Life</i>. Among the
more elaborate biographies the <i>Life of
Hans Christian Andersen</i> by R. Nisbet Bain
is probably the best. The first translation
of the <i>Tales</i> into English was made by
Mary Howitt in 1846 and, as far as it goes,
is still regarded as one of the finest. However,
Andersen has been very fortunate in
his many translators. The version by
H. W. Dulcken has been published in many
cheap forms and perhaps more widely read
than any other. In addition to the stories
in the following pages, some of those most
suitable for use are "The Little Match
Girl," "The Silver Shilling," "Five Peas
in the Pod," "Hans Clodhopper," and
"The Snow Queen." The latter is one
of the longest and an undoubted masterpiece.</div>

<div class="hang1">The first two stories following are taken from
Mrs. Henderson's <i>Andersen's Best Fairy
Tales</i>. (Copyright. Rand McNally &amp; Co.)
This little book contains thirteen stories
in a very simple translation and also an
excellent story of Andersen's life in a form
most attractive to children. "The Princess
and the Pea" is a story for the story's
sake. The humor, perhaps slightly satirical,
is based upon the notion so common
in the old folk tales that royal personages
are decidedly more delicate than the person
of low degree. However, the tendency to
think oneself of more consequence than
another is not confined to any one class.</div>


<h4><br />THE REAL PRINCESS</h4>

<div class='center'>HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN<br />
<br />

<p>There was once a Prince who wanted
to marry a Princess. But it was only
a <i>real</i> Princess that he wanted to marry.</p>

<p>He traveled all over the world to find
a real one. But, although there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
plenty of princesses, whether they were
<i>real</i> princesses he could never discover.
There was always something that did
not seem quite right about them.</p>

<p>At last he had to come home again.
But he was very sad, because he wanted
to marry a <i>real</i> Princess.</p>

<p>One night there was a terrible storm.
It thundered and lightened and the rain
poured down in torrents. In the middle
of the storm there came a knocking,
knocking, knocking at the castle gate.
The kind old King himself went down
to open the castle gate.</p>

<p>It was a young Princess that stood
outside the gate. The wind and the
rain had almost blown her to pieces.
Water streamed out of her hair and out
of her clothes. Water ran in at the
points of her shoes and out again at the
heels. Yet she said that she was a <i>real</i>
Princess.</p>

<p>"Well, we will soon find out about
that!" thought the Queen.</p>

<p>She said nothing, but went into the
bedroom, took off all the bedding, and
put a small dried pea on the bottom of
the bedstead. Then she piled twenty
mattresses on top of the pea, and on
top of these she put twenty feather beds.
This was where the Princess had to sleep
that night.</p>

<p>In the morning they asked her how
she had slept through the night.</p>

<p>"Oh, miserably!" said the Princess.
"I hardly closed my eyes the whole
night long! Goodness only knows what
was in my bed! I slept upon something
so hard that I am black and blue
all over. It was dreadful!"</p>

<p>So then they knew that she was a
<i>real</i> Princess. For, through the twenty
mattresses and the twenty feather beds,
she had still felt the pea. No one but
a <i>real</i> Princess could have had such a
tender skin.</p>

<p>So the Prince took her for his wife.
He knew now that he had a <i>real</i> Princess.</p>

<p>As for the pea, it was put in a museum
where it may still be seen if no one has
carried it away.</p>

<p>Now this is a true story!</p>

<div class="hang1">With some dozen exceptions, all of Andersen's
<i>Tales</i> are based upon older stories, either
upon some old folk tale or upon something
that he ran across in his reading. Dr.
Brandes, in his <i>Eminent Authors</i>, shows in
detail how "The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Emporer's'">Emperor's</ins> New Clothes"
came into being. "One day in turning
over the leaves of Don Manuel's <i>Count
Lucanor</i>, Andersen became charmed by
the homely wisdom of the old Spanish
story, with the delicate flavor of the Middle
Ages pervading it, and he lingered over
chapter vii, which treats of how a king
was served by three rogues." But Andersen's
story is a very different one in many
ways from his Spanish original. For one
thing, the meaning is so universal that no
one can miss it. Most of us have, in all
likelihood, at some time pretended to know
what we do not know or to be what we are
not in order to save our face, to avoid the
censure or ridicule of others. "There is
much concerning which people dare not
speak the truth, through cowardice, through
fear of acting otherwise than 'all the world,'
through anxiety lest they should appear
stupid. And the story is eternally new and
it never ends. It has its grave side, but
just because of its endlessness it has also
its humorous side." When the absurd
bubble of the grand procession is punctured
by the child, whose mental honesty
has not yet been spoiled by the pressure
of convention, the Emperor "held himself
stiffer than ever, and the chamberlains
carried the invisible train." For it would
never do to hold up the procession!</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES</h4>

<div class='center'>HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN<br />
<br />
(Version by Alice Corbin Henderson)</div>


<p>Many years ago there lived an Emperor
who thought so much of new clothes
that he spent all his money on them. He
did not care for his soldiers; he did not
care to go to the theater. He liked to
drive out in the park only that he might
show off his new clothes. He had a coat
for every hour of the day. They usually
say of a king, "He is in the council chamber."
But of the Emperor they said,
"He is in the clothes closet!"</p>

<p>It was a gay city in which the Emperor
lived. And many strangers came to
visit it every day. Among these, one
day, there came two rogues who set themselves
up as weavers. They said they
knew how to weave the most beautiful
cloths imaginable. And not only were
the colors and patterns used remarkably
beautiful, but clothes made from this
cloth could not be seen by any one who
was unfit for the office he held or was too
stupid for any use.</p>

<p>"Those would be fine clothes!" thought
the Emperor. "If I wore those I could
find out what men in my empire were not
fit for the places they held. I could tell
the clever men from the dunces! I must
have some clothes woven for me at once!"</p>

<p>So he gave the two rogues a great deal
of money that they might begin their
work at once.</p>

<p>The rogues immediately put up two
looms and pretended to be working.
But there was nothing at all on their
looms. They called for the finest silks
and the brightest gold, but this they put
into their pockets. At the empty looms
they worked steadily until late into the
night.</p>

<p>"I should like to know how the weavers
are getting on with my clothes," thought
the Emperor.</p>

<p>But he felt a little uneasy when he
thought that any one who was stupid or
was not fit for his office would be unable
to see the cloth. Of course he had no
fears for himself; but still he thought he
would send some one else first, just to
see how matters stood.</p>

<p>"I will send my faithful old Minister
to the weavers," thought the Emperor.
"He can see how the stuff looks, for he is
a clever man, and no one is so careful in
fulfilling duties as he is!"</p>

<p>So the good old Minister went into the
room where the two rogues sat working
at the empty looms.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us!" thought the old Minister,
opening his eyes wide, "I can't see
a thing!" But he didn't care to say so.</p>

<p>Both the rascals begged him to be good
enough to step a little nearer. They
pointed to the empty looms and asked
him if he did not think the pattern and
the coloring wonderful. The poor old
Minister stared and stared as hard as he
could, but he could not see anything, for,
of course, there was nothing to see!</p>

<p>"Mercy!" he said to himself. "Is it
possible that I am a dunce? I never
thought so! Certainly no one must
know it. Am I unfit for office? It will
never do to say that I cannot see the
stuff!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, why do you say nothing of
it?" asked the rogue who was pretending
to weave.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is beautiful&mdash;charming!" said
the old Minister, peering through his
spectacles. "What a fine pattern, and
what wonderful colors! I shall tell the
Emperor that I am very much pleased
with it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we are glad to hear you say so,"
answered the two swindlers.</p>

<p>Then they named all the colors of the
invisible cloth upon the looms, and
described the peculiar pattern. The old
Minister listened intently, so that he
could repeat all that was said of it to the
Emperor.</p>

<p>The rogues now began to demand more
money, more silk, and more gold thread
in order to proceed with the weaving.
All of this, of course, went into their
pockets. Not a single strand was ever
put on the empty looms at which they
went on working.</p>

<p>The Emperor soon sent another faithful
friend to see how soon the new clothes
would be ready. But he fared no better
than the Minister. He looked and looked
and looked, but still saw nothing but the
empty looms.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a pretty piece of stuff?"
asked both rogues, showing and explaining
the handsome pattern which was not
there at all.</p>

<p>"I am not stupid!" thought the man.
"It must be that I am not worthy of my
good position. That is, indeed, strange.
But I must not let it be known!"</p>

<p>So he praised the cloth he did not see,
and expressed his approval of the color
and the design that were not there. To
the Emperor he said, "It is charming!"</p>

<p>Soon everybody in town was talking
about the wonderful cloth that the two
rogues were weaving.</p>

<p>The Emperor began to think now that
he himself would like to see the wonderful
cloth while it was still on the looms.
Accompanied by a number of his friends,
among whom were the two faithful
officers who had already beheld the
imaginary stuff, he went to visit the two
men who were weaving, might and
main, without any fiber and without any
thread.</p>

<p>"Isn't it splendid!" cried the two
statesmen who had already been there,
and who thought the others would see
something upon the empty looms. "Look,
your Majesty! What colors! And what
a design!"</p>

<p>"What's this?" thought the Emperor.
"I see nothing at all! Am I a dunce?
Am I not fit to be Emperor? That
would be the worst thing that could
happen to me, if it were true."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is very pretty!" said the
Emperor aloud. "It has my highest
approval!"</p>

<p>He nodded his head happily, and stared
at the empty looms. Never would he
say that he could see nothing!</p>

<p>His friends, too, gazed and gazed, but
saw no more than had the others. Yet
they all cried out, "It is beautiful!" and
advised the Emperor to wear a suit made
of this cloth in a great procession that was
soon to take place.</p>

<p>"It is magnificent, gorgeous!" was the
cry that went from mouth to mouth.
The Emperor gave each of the rogues a
royal ribbon to wear in his buttonhole,
and called them the Imperial Court
Weavers.</p>

<p>The rogues were up the whole night
before the morning of the procession.
They kept more than sixteen candles
burning. The people could see them
hard at work, completing the new clothes
of the Emperor. They took yards of
stuff down from the empty looms; they
made cuts in the air with big scissors;
they sewed with needles without thread;
and, at last, they said, "The clothes are
ready!"</p>

<p>The Emperor himself, with his grandest
courtiers, went to put on his new suit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"See!" said the rogues, lifting their
arms as if holding something. "Here are
the trousers! Here is the coat! Here
is the cape!" and so on. "It is as light
as a spider's web. One might think one
had nothing on. But that is just the
beauty of it!"</p>

<p>"Very nice," said the courtiers. But
they could see nothing; for there <i>was</i>
nothing!</p>

<p>"Will your Imperial Majesty be graciously
pleased to take off your clothes,"
asked the rogues, "so that we may put
on the new ones before this long mirror?"</p>

<p>The Emperor took off all his own
clothes, and the two rogues pretended
to put on each new garment as it was
ready. They wrapped him about, and
they tied and they buttoned. The Emperor
turned round and round before the
mirror.</p>

<p>"How well his Majesty looks in his
new clothes!" said the people. "How
becoming they are! What a pattern!
What colors! It is a beautiful dress!"</p>

<p>"They are waiting outside with the
canopy which is to be carried over your
Majesty in the procession," said the
master of ceremonies.</p>

<p>"I am ready," said the Emperor.
"Don't the clothes fit well?" he asked,
giving a last glance into the mirror as
though he were looking at all his new
finery.</p>

<p>The men who were to carry the train
of the Emperor's cloak stooped down to
the floor as if picking up the train, and
then held it high in the air. They did
not dare let it be known that they could
see nothing.</p>

<p>So the Emperor marched along under
the bright canopy. Everybody in the
streets and at the windows cried out:
"How beautiful the Emperor's new
clothes are! What a fine train! And
they fit to perfection!"</p>

<p>No one would let it be known that he
could see nothing, for that would have
proved that he was unfit for office or
that he was very, very stupid. None of
the Emperor's clothes had ever been as
successful as these.</p>

<p>"But he has nothing on!" said a little
child.</p>

<p>"Just listen to the innocent!" said its
father.</p>

<p>But one person whispered to another
what the child had said. "He has nothing
on! A child says he has nothing on!"</p>

<p>"But he has nothing on!" at last cried
all the people.</p>

<p>The Emperor writhed, for he knew that
this was true. But he realized that it
would never do to stop the procession.
So he held himself stiffer than ever, and
the chamberlains carried the invisible
train.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_194" id="Note_194">194</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">In his story "The Nightingale," Andersen
suggests that the so-called upper class of
society may become so conventionalized
as to be unable to appreciate true beauty.
Poor fishermen and the little kitchen girl
in the story recognize the beauty of the
exquisite song of the nightingale, and
Andersen shows his regard for royalty by
having the emperor appreciate it twice.
The last part of the story is especially
impressive. When Death approached the
emperor and took from him the symbols
that had made him rank above his fellows,
the emperor saw the realities of life and
again perceived the beauty of the nightingale's
song. This contact with real life
made Death shrink away. Then the
emperor learned Andersen's message to
artificial society: If you would behold
true beauty, you must have it in your
own heart.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />THE NIGHTINGALE</h4>

<div class='center'>HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</div>

<p>In China, you must know, the Emperor
is a Chinaman, and all whom he has
about him are Chinamen too. It happened
a good many years ago, but that's
just why it's worth while to hear the story
before it is forgotten. The Emperor's
palace was the most splendid in the
world; it was made entirely of porcelain,
very costly, but so delicate and brittle
that one had to take care how one
touched it. In the garden were to be
seen the most wonderful flowers, and to
the costliest of them silver bells were
tied, which sounded, so that nobody
should pass by without noticing the
flowers. Yes, everything in the Emperor's
garden was admirably arranged.
And it extended so far that the gardener
himself did not know where the end was.
If a man went on and on, he came into
a glorious forest with high trees and deep
lakes. The wood extended straight down
to the sea, which was blue and deep;
great ships could sail, too, beneath the
branches of the trees; and in the trees
lived a Nightingale, which sang so
splendidly that even the poor fisherman,
who had many other things to do,
stopped still and listened, when he had
gone out at night to throw out his nets,
and heard the Nightingale.</p>

<p>"How beautiful that is!" he said; but
he was obliged to attend to his property,
and thus forgot the bird. But when the
next night the bird sang again, and the
fisherman heard it, he exclaimed again,
"How beautiful that is!"</p>

<p>From all the countries of the world
travelers came to the city of the Emperor,
and admired it, and the palace and
the garden, but when they heard the
Nightingale, they said, "That is the
best of all!"</p>

<p>And the travelers told of it when they
came home; and the learn&egrave;d men wrote
many books about the town, the palace,
and the garden. But they did not forget
the Nightingale; that was placed highest
of all; and those who were poets wrote
most magnificent poems about the Nightingale
in the wood by the deep lake.</p>

<p>The books went through all the world,
and a few of them once came to the
Emperor. He sat in his golden chair,
and read, and read: every moment he
nodded his head, for it pleased him to
peruse the masterly descriptions of the
city, the palace, and the garden. "But
the Nightingale is the best of all," it
stood written there.</p>

<p>"What's that?" exclaimed the Emperor.
"I don't know the Nightingale
at all! Is there such a bird in my empire,
and even in my garden? I've never heard
of that. To think that I should have to
learn such a thing for the first time
from books!"</p>

<p>And hereupon he called his cavalier.
This cavalier was so grand that if anyone
lower in rank than himself dared to
speak to him, or to ask him any question,
he answered nothing but "P!"&mdash;and
that meant nothing.</p>

<p>"There is said to be a wonderful bird
here called a Nightingale," said the
Emperor. "They say it is the best
thing in all my great empire. Why have
I never heard anything about it?"</p>

<p>"I have never heard him named,"
replied the cavalier. "He has never
been introduced at Court."</p>

<p>"I command that he shall appear this
evening, and sing before me," said the
Emperor. "All the world knows what
I possess, and I do not know it myself!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have never heard him mentioned,"
said the cavalier. "I will seek for him.
I will find him."</p>

<p>But where was he to be found? The
cavalier ran up and down all the staircases,
through halls and passages, but no
one among all those whom he met had
heard talk of the Nightingale. And the
cavalier ran back to the Emperor, and
said that it must be a fable invented by
the writers of books.</p>

<p>"Your Imperial Majesty cannot believe
how much is written that is fiction,
besides something that they call the
black art."</p>

<p>"But the book in which I read this,"
said the Emperor, "was sent to me by
the high and mighty Emperor of Japan
and therefore it cannot be a falsehood.
I <i>will</i> hear the Nightingale! It must be
here this evening! It has my imperial
favor; and if it does not come, all the
Court shall be trampled upon after the
Court has supped!"</p>

<p>"Tsing-pe!" said the cavalier; and
again he ran up and down all the staircases,
and through all the halls and corridors;
and half the Court ran with
him, for the courtiers did not like being
trampled upon.</p>

<p>Then there was a great inquiry after
the wonderful Nightingale, which all the
world knew excepting the people at
Court.</p>

<p>At last they met with a poor little girl
in the kitchen, who said:</p>

<p>"The Nightingale? I know it well;
yes, it can sing gloriously. Every evening
I get leave to carry my poor sick
mother the scraps from the table. She
lives down by the strand; and when I
get back and am tired, and rest in the
wood, then I hear the Nightingale sing.
And then the water comes into my
eyes, and it is just as if my mother
kissed me."</p>

<p>"Little kitchen girl," said the cavalier,
"I will get you a place in the Court
kitchen, with permission to see the
Emperor dine, if you will but lead us
to the Nightingale, for it is announced
for this evening."</p>

<p>So they all went out into the wood
where the Nightingale was accustomed to
sing; half the Court went forth. When
they were in the midst of their journey
a cow began to low.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the Court pages, "now
we have it! That shows a wonderful
power in so small a creature! I have
certainly heard it before."</p>

<p>"No, those are cows lowing," said the
little kitchen girl. "We are a long way
from the place yet."</p>

<p>Now the frogs began to croak in the
marsh.</p>

<p>"Glorious!" said the Chinese Court
preacher. "Now I hear it&mdash;it sounds
just like little church bells."</p>

<p>"No, those are frogs," said the little
kitchen maid. "But now I think we
shall soon hear it."</p>

<p>And then the Nightingale began to sing.</p>

<p>"That is it!" exclaimed the little girl.
"Listen, listen! and yonder it sits."</p>

<p>And she pointed to a little gray bird
up in the boughs.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" cried the cavalier.
"I should never have thought it looked
like that! How simple it looks! It must
certainly have lost its color at seeing such
grand people around."</p>

<p>"Little Nightingale!" called the little
kitchen maid, quite loudly, "our gracious
Emperor wishes you to sing before him."</p>

<p>"With the greatest pleasure!" replied
the Nightingale, and began to sing most
delightfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"It sounds just like glass bells!" said
the cavalier. "And look at its little
throat, how it's working! It's wonderful
that we should never have heard it before.
That bird will be a great success at
Court."</p>

<p>"Shall I sing once more before the
Emperor?" inquired the Nightingale, for
it thought the Emperor was present.</p>

<p>"My excellent little Nightingale," said
the cavalier, "I have great pleasure in
inviting you to a Court festival this
evening, when you shall charm his
Imperial Majesty with your beautiful
singing."</p>

<p>"My song sounds best in the green
wood," replied the Nightingale; still it
came willingly when it heard what the
Emperor wished.</p>

<p>The palace was festively adorned.
The walls and the flooring, which were
of porcelain, gleamed in the rays of
thousands of golden lamps. The most
glorious flowers, which could ring clearly,
had been placed in the passages. There
was a running to and fro, and a thorough
draught, and all the bells rang so loudly
that one could not hear one's self speak.</p>

<p>In the midst of the great hall, where
the Emperor sat, a golden perch had
been placed, on which the Nightingale
was to sit. The whole Court was there,
and the little cook-maid had got leave to
stand behind the door, as she had now
received the title of a real Court cook.
All were in full dress, and all looked at
the little gray bird, to which the Emperor
nodded.</p>

<p>And the Nightingale sang so gloriously
that the tears came into the Emperor's
eyes, and the tears ran down over his
cheeks; then the Nightingale sang still
more sweetly, that went straight to the
heart. The Emperor was so much
pleased that he said the Nightingale
should have his golden slipper to wear
round its neck. But the Nightingale
declined this with thanks, saying it had
already received a sufficient reward.</p>

<p>"I have seen tears in the Emperor's
eyes&mdash;that is the real treasure to me.
An Emperor's tears have a peculiar
power. I am rewarded enough!" And
then it sang again with a sweet, glorious
voice.</p>

<p>"That's the most amiable coquetry I
ever saw!" said the ladies who stood
round about, and then they took water in
their mouths to gurgle when anyone
spoke to them. They thought they
should be nightingales too. And the
lackeys and chambermaids reported that
they were satisfied also; and that was
saying a good deal, for they are the most
difficult to please. In short, the Nightingale
achieved a real success.</p>

<p>It was now to remain at Court, to
have its own cage, with liberty to go
out twice every day and once at night.
Twelve servants were appointed when
the Nightingale went out, each of whom
had a silken string fastened to the bird's
legs, which they held very tight. There
was really no pleasure in an excursion of
that kind.</p>

<p>The whole city spoke of the wonderful
bird, and whenever two people met, one
said nothing but "Nightin," and the
other said "gale"; and then they both
sighed, and understood one another.
Eleven pedlars' children were named
after the bird, but not one of them could
sing a note.</p>

<p>One day the Emperor received a large
parcel, on which was written, "The
Nightingale."</p>

<p>"There we have a new book about this
celebrated bird," said the Emperor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not a book, but a little work
of art, contained in a box&mdash;an artificial
nightingale, which was to sing like a
natural one, and was brilliantly ornamented
with diamonds, sapphires, and
rubies. So soon as the artificial bird
was wound up, he could sing one of the
pieces that he really sang, and then his
tail moved up and down, and shone with
silver and gold. Round his neck hung
a little ribbon, and on that was written,
"The Emperor of China's nightingale is
poor compared to that of the Emperor
of Japan."</p>

<p>"That is capital!" said they all, and
he who had brought the artificial bird
immediately received the title, Imperial
Head-Nightingale-Bringer.</p>

<p>"Now they must sing together; what
a duet that will be!" cried the courtiers.</p>

<p>And so they had to sing together; but
it did not sound very well, for the real
Nightingale sang its own way, and the
artificial bird sang waltzes.</p>

<p>"That's not his fault," said the playmaster;
"he's quite perfect, and very
much in my style."</p>

<p>Now the artificial bird was to sing
alone. It had just as much success as
the real one, and then it was much handsomer
to look at&mdash;it shone like bracelets
and breastpins.</p>

<p>Three and thirty times over did it
sing the same piece, and yet was not
tired. The people would gladly have
heard it again, but the Emperor said that
the living Nightingale ought to sing
something now. But where was it? No
one had noticed that it had flown away
out of the open window, back to the
green wood.</p>

<p>"But what has become of that?"
asked the Emperor.</p>

<p>And all the courtiers abused the Nightingale,
and declared that it was a very
ungrateful creature.</p>

<p>"We have the best bird after all,"
said they.</p>

<p>And so the artificial bird had to sing
again, and that was the thirty-fourth
time that they listened to the same piece.
For all that they did not know it quite
by heart, for it was so very difficult.
And the playmaster praised the bird
particularly; yes, he declared that it was
better than a nightingale, not only with
regard to its plumage and the many
beautiful diamonds, but inside as well.</p>

<p>"For you see, ladies and gentlemen,
and above all, your Imperial Majesty,
with a real nightingale one can never
calculate what is coming, but in this
artificial bird, everything is settled.
One can explain it; one can open it and
make people understand where the
waltzes come from, how they go, and
how one follows up another."</p>

<p>"Those are quite our own ideas,"
they all said.</p>

<p>And the speaker received permission to
show the bird to the people on the next
Sunday. The people were to hear it
sing too, the Emperor commanded: and
they did hear it, and were as much
pleased as if they had all got tipsy upon
tea, for that's quite the Chinese fashion,
and they all said, "Oh!" and held up
their forefingers and nodded. But the
poor fisherman, who had heard the real
Nightingale, said:</p>

<p>"It sounds pretty enough, and the
melodies resemble each other, but there's
something wanting, though I know not
what!"</p>

<p>The real Nightingale was banished
from the country and empire. The
artificial bird had its place on a silken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
cushion close to the Emperor's bed; all
the presents it had received, gold and
precious stones, were ranged about it;
in title it had advanced to be the High
Imperial After-Dinner-Singer, and in
rank to Number One on the left hand;
for the Emperor considered that side the
most important on which the heart is
placed, and even in an Emperor the heart
is on the left side; and the playmaster
wrote a work of five and twenty volumes
about the artificial bird; it was very
learn&egrave;d and very long, full of the most
difficult Chinese words; but yet all the
people declared that they had read it
and understood it, for fear of being considered
stupid, and having their bodies
trampled on.</p>

<p>So a whole year went by. The Emperor,
the Court, and all the other
Chinese knew every little twitter in the
artificial bird's song by heart. But just
for that reason it pleased them best&mdash;they
could sing with it themselves, and
they did so. The street boys sang,
"Tsi-tsi-tsi-glug-glug!" and the Emperor
himself sang it too. Yes, that was
certainly famous.</p>

<p>But one evening, when the artificial
bird was singing its best, and the Emperor
lay in bed listening to it, something
inside the bird said, "Whizz!" Something
cracked. "Whir-r-r!" All the
wheels ran round, and then the music
stopped.</p>

<p>The Emperor immediately sprang out
of bed, and caused his body physician to
be called; but what could <i>he</i> do? Then
they sent for a watchmaker, and after a
good deal of talking and investigation,
the bird was put into something like
order, but the watchmaker said that
the bird must be carefully treated, for
the barrels were worn, and it would be
impossible to put new ones in in such a
manner that the music would go. There
was a great lamentation; only once in
the year was it permitted to let the bird
sing, and that was almost too much.
But then the playmaster made a little
speech full of heavy words, and said this
was just as good as before&mdash;and so of
course it was as good as before.</p>

<p>Now five years had gone by, and a
real grief came upon the whole nation.
The Chinese were really fond of their
Emperor, and now he was ill, and could
not, it was said, live much longer.
Already a new Emperor had been chosen,
and the people stood out in the street and
asked the cavalier how the Emperor did.</p>

<p>"P!" said he, and shook his head.</p>

<p>Cold and pale lay the Emperor in his
great, gorgeous bed; the whole Court
thought him dead, and each one ran to
pay homage to the new ruler. The
chamberlains ran out to talk it over,
and the ladies' maids had a great coffee
party. All about, in all the halls and
passages, cloth had been laid down so
that no footstep could be heard, and
therefore it was quiet there, quite quiet.
But the Emperor was not dead yet; stiff
and pale he lay on the gorgeous bed, with
the long velvet curtains and the heavy
gold tassels; high up, a window stood
open, and the moon shone in upon the
Emperor and the artificial bird.</p>

<p>The poor Emperor could scarcely
breathe; it was just as if something lay
upon his chest; he opened his eyes, and
then he saw that it was Death who sat
upon his chest, and had put on his golden
crown, and held in one hand the Emperor's
sword, in the other his beautiful
banner. And all around, from among
the folds of the splendid velvet curtains,
strange heads peered forth; a few very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
ugly, the rest quite lovely and mild.
These were all the Emperor's bad and
good deeds, that stood before him now
that Death sat upon his heart.</p>

<p>"Do you remember this?" whispered
one to the other. "Do you remember
that?" and then they told him so much
that the perspiration ran from his forehead.</p>

<p>"I did not know that!" said the Emperor.
"Music! music! the great Chinese
drum!" he cried, "so that I need not hear
all they say!"</p>

<p>And they continued speaking, and
Death nodded like a Chinaman to all
they said.</p>

<p>"Music! music!" cried the Emperor.
"You little precious golden bird, sing,
sing! I have given you gold and costly
presents; I have even hung my golden
slipper around your neck&mdash;sing now,
sing!"</p>

<p>But the bird stood still; no one was
there to wind him up, and he could not
sing without that; but Death continued to
stare at the Emperor with his great, hollow
eyes, and it was quiet, fearfully quiet.</p>

<p>Then there sounded from the window,
suddenly, the most lovely song. It was
the little live Nightingale, that sat outside
on a spray. It had heard of the
Emperor's sad plight, and had come to
sing to him of comfort and hope. As it
sang the specters grew paler and paler;
the blood ran quicker and more quickly
through the Emperor's weak limbs; and
even Death listened, and said:</p>

<p>"Go on, little Nightingale, go on!"</p>

<p>"But will you give me that splendid
golden sword? Will you give me that
rich banner? Will you give me the
Emperor's crown?"</p>

<p>And Death gave up each of these
treasures for a song. And the Nightingale
sang on and on; and it sang of the
quiet churchyard where the white roses
grow, where the elder blossoms smell
sweet, and where the fresh grass is
moistened by the tears of survivors.
Then Death felt a longing to see his garden,
and floated out at the window in the
form of a cold white mist.</p>

<p>"Thanks! thanks!" said the Emperor.
"You heavenly little bird; I know you
well. I banished you from my country
and empire, and yet you have charmed
away the evil faces from my couch, and
banished Death from my heart! How
can I reward you?"</p>

<p>"You have rewarded me!" replied the
Nightingale. "I have drawn tears from
your eyes, when I sang the first time&mdash;I
shall never forget that. Those are the
jewels that rejoice a singer's heart. But
now sleep, and grow fresh and strong
again. I will sing you something."</p>

<p>And it sang, and the Emperor fell into
a sweet slumber. Ah! how mild and
refreshing that sleep was! The sun shone
upon him through the windows when he
awoke refreshed and restored: not one of
his servants had yet returned, for they
all thought he was dead; only the Nightingale
still sat beside him and sang.</p>

<p>"You must always stay with me,"
said the Emperor. "You shall sing as
you please; and I'll break the artificial
bird into a thousand pieces."</p>

<p>"Not so," replied the Nightingale.
"It did well as long as it could; keep it
as you have done till now. I cannot
build my nest in the palace to dwell in it,
but let me come when I feel the wish;
then I will sit in the evening on the spray
yonder by the window, and sing you
something, so that you may be glad and
thoughtful at once. I will sing of those
who are happy and of those who suffer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
I will sing of good and of evil that remains
hidden round about you. The little
singing bird flies far around, to the poor
fisherman, to the peasant's roof, to
everyone who dwells far away from you
and from your Court. I love your heart
more than your crown, and yet the crown
has an air of sanctity about it. I will
come and sing to you&mdash;but one thing
you must promise me."</p>

<p>"Every thing!" said the Emperor; and
he stood there in his imperial robes,
which he had put on himself, and pressed
the sword which was heavy with gold
to his heart.</p>

<p>"One thing I beg of you: tell no one
that you have a little bird who tells you
everything. Then it will go all the
better."</p>

<p>And the Nightingale flew away.</p>

<p>The servants came in to look at their
dead Emperor, and&mdash;yes, there he stood,
and the Emperor said, "Good-morning!"</p>

<h4><br />THE FIR TREE</h4>

<div class='center'>HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</div>

<p>Out in the forest stood a pretty little
Fir Tree. It had a good place; it could
have sunlight, air there was in plenty,
and all around grew many larger comrades&mdash;pines
as well as firs. But the
little Fir Tree wished ardently to become
greater. It did not care for the warm
sun and the fresh air; it took no notice
of the peasant children, who went about
talking together, when they had come
out to look for strawberries and raspberries.
Often they came with a whole
pot-full, or had strung berries on a straw;
then they would sit down by the little
Fir Tree and say, "How pretty and
small that one is!" and the Fir Tree
did not like to hear that at all.</p>

<p>Next year he had grown a great joint,
and the following year he was longer
still, for in fir trees one can always tell
by the number of rings they have how
many years they have been growing.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I were only as great a tree as
the other!" sighed the little Fir, "then
I would spread my branches far around,
and look out from my crown into the
wide world. The birds would then build
nests in my boughs, and when the wind
blew I could nod just as grandly as the
others yonder."</p>

<p>It took no pleasure in the sunshine, in
the birds, and in the red clouds that
went sailing over him morning and
evening.</p>

<p>When it was winter, and the snow lay
all around, white and sparkling, a hare
would often come jumping along, and
spring right over the little Fir Tree.
Oh! this made him so angry. But two
winters went by, and when the third
came the little Tree had grown so tall
that the hare was obliged to run round it.</p>

<p>"Oh! to grow, to grow, and become old;
that's the only fine thing in the world,"
thought the Tree.</p>

<p>In the autumn woodcutters always
came and felled a few of the largest
trees; that was done this year too, and
the little Fir Tree, that was now quite
well grown, shuddered with fear, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
great stately trees fell to the ground
with a crash, and their branches were
cut off, so that the trees looked quite
naked, long, and slender&mdash;they could
hardly be recognized. But then they
were laid upon wagons, and horses
dragged them away out of the wood.
Where were they going? What destiny
awaited them?</p>

<p>In the spring, when the Swallows and
the Stork came, the Tree asked them,
"Do you know where they were taken?
Did you not meet them?"</p>

<p>The Swallows knew nothing about it,
but the Stork looked thoughtful, nodded
his head, and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. I met many new
ships when I flew out of Egypt; on the
ships were stately masts; I fancy these
were the trees. They smelt like fir. I
can assure you they're stately&mdash;very
stately."</p>

<p>"Oh that I were only big enough to
go over the sea! What kind of thing
is this sea, and how does it look?"</p>

<p>"It would take too long to explain all
that," said the Stork, and he went away.</p>

<p>"Rejoice in thy youth," said the Sunbeams;
"rejoice in thy fresh growth, and
in the young life that is within thee."</p>

<p>And the wind kissed the Tree, and the
dew wept tears upon it; but the Fir
Tree did not understand that.</p>

<p>When Christmas-time approached,
quite young trees were felled, sometimes
trees which were neither so old nor so
large as this Fir Tree, that never rested,
but always wanted to go away. These
young trees, which were always the most
beautiful, kept all their branches; they
were put upon wagons, and horses
dragged them away out of the wood.</p>

<p>"Where are they all going?" asked the
Fir Tree. "They are not greater than
I&mdash;indeed, one of them was much
smaller. Why do they keep all their
branches? Whither are they taken?"</p>

<p>"We know that! We know that!"
chirped the Sparrows. "Yonder in the
town we looked in at the windows. We
know where they go. Oh! they are
dressed up in the greatest pomp and
splendor that can be imagined. We
have looked in at the windows, and have
perceived that they are planted in the
middle of a warm room, and adorned
with the most beautiful things&mdash;gilt
apples, honey-cakes, playthings, and
many hundred candles."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked the Fir Tree, and
trembled through all its branches. "And
then? What happens then?"</p>

<p>"Why, we have not seen anything
more. But it was incomparable."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may be destined to tread
this glorious path one day!" cried the
Fir Tree, rejoicingly. "That is even
better than traveling across the sea.
How painfully I long for it! If it were
only Christmas now! Now I am great
and grown up, like the rest who were
led away last year. Oh, if I were only
on the carriage! If I were only in the
warm room, among all the pomp and
splendor! And then? Yes, then something
even better will come, something
far more charming, or else why should
they adorn me so? There must be something
grander, something greater still
to come; but what? Oh! I'm suffering,
I'm longing! I don't know myself what
is the matter with me!"</p>

<p>"Rejoice in us," said Air and Sunshine.
"Rejoice in thy fresh youth here in the
woodland."</p>

<p>But the Fir Tree did not rejoice at all,
but it grew and grew; winter and summer
it stood there, green, dark green. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
people who saw it said, "That's a handsome
tree!" and at Christmas time it
was felled before any one of the others.
The ax cut deep into its marrow, and
the tree fell to the ground with a sigh; it
felt a pain, a sensation of faintness, and
could not think at all of happiness, for
it was sad at parting from its home,
from the place where it had grown up;
it knew that it should never again see
the dear old companions, the little bushes
and flowers all around&mdash;perhaps not
even the birds. The parting was not at
all agreeable.</p>

<p>The Tree only came to itself when it
was unloaded in a yard, with other trees,
and heard a man say:</p>

<p>"This one is famous; we want only
this one!"</p>

<p>Now two servants came in gay liveries,
and carried the Fir Tree into a large,
beautiful saloon. All around the walls
hung pictures, and by the great stove
stood large Chinese vases with lions on
the covers; there were rocking-chairs,
silken sofas, great tables covered with
picture books, and toys worth a hundred
times a hundred dollars, at least the
children said so. And the Fir Tree was
put into a great tub filled with sand; but
no one could see that it was a tub,
for it was hung round with green cloth,
and stood on a large, many-colored
carpet. Oh, how the Tree trembled!
What was to happen now? The servants,
and the young ladies also, decked it out.
On one branch they hung little nets, cut
out of colored paper; every net was
filled with sweetmeats; golden apples
and walnuts hung down, as if they grew
there, and more than a hundred little
candles, red, white, and blue, were
fastened to the different boughs. Dolls
that looked exactly like real people&mdash;the
tree had never seen such before&mdash;swung
among the foliage, and high on the summit
of the Tree was fixed a tinsel star.
It was splendid, particularly splendid.</p>

<p>"This evening," said all, "this evening
it will shine."</p>

<p>"Oh," thought the Tree, "that it were
evening already! Oh, that the lights
may be soon lit up! When may that be
done? I wonder if trees will come out
of the forest to look at me? Will the
sparrows fly against the panes? Shall I
grow fast here, and stand adorned in
summer and winter?"</p>

<p>Yes, he did not guess badly. But he
had a complete backache from mere
longing, and the backache is just as
bad for a Tree as the headache for a
person.</p>

<p>At last the candles were lighted.
What a brilliance, what splendor! The
Tree trembled so in all its branches that
one of the candles set fire to a green
twig, and it was scorched.</p>

<p>"Heaven preserve us!" cried the young
ladies; and they hastily put the fire out.</p>

<p>Now the Tree might not even tremble.
Oh, that was terrible! It was so afraid
of setting fire to some of its ornaments,
and it was quite bewildered with all the
brilliance. And now the folding doors
were thrown open, and a number of
children rushed in as if they would have
overturned the whole Tree; the older
people followed more deliberately. The
little ones stood quite silent, but only
for a minute; then they shouted till the
room rang: they danced gleefully round
the Tree, and one present after another
was plucked from it.</p>

<p>"What are they about?" thought the
Tree. "What's going to be done?"</p>

<p>And the candles burned down to the
twigs, and as they burned down they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
were extinguished, and then the children
received permission to plunder the Tree.
Oh! they rushed in upon it, so that
every branch cracked again: if it had not
been fastened by the top and by the
golden star to the ceiling, it would have
fallen down.</p>

<p>The children danced about with their
pretty toys. No one looked at the Tree
except one old man, who came up and
peeped among the branches, but only to
see if a fig or an apple had not been
forgotten.</p>

<p>"A story! A story!" shouted the
children; and they drew a little fat man
toward the tree; and he sat down just
beneath it&mdash;"for then we shall be in
the green wood," said he, "and the tree
may have the advantage of listening to
my tale. But I can only tell one. Will
you hear the story of Ivede-Avede, or
of Klumpey-Dumpey, who fell downstairs,
and still was raised up to honor
and married the Princess?"</p>

<p>"Ivede-Avede!" cried some, "Klumpey-Dumpey!"
cried others, and there
was a great crying and shouting. Only
the Fir Tree was quite silent, and
thought, "Shall I not be in it? Shall
I have nothing to do in it?" But he
had been in the evening's amusement,
and had done what was required of
him.</p>

<p>And the fat man told about Klumpey-Dumpey
who fell downstairs, and yet
was raised to honor and married the
Princess. And the children clapped their
hands, and cried, "Tell another! tell
another!" for they wanted to hear about
Ivede-Avede; but they only got the
story of Klumpey-Dumpey. The Fir
Tree stood quite silent and thoughtful;
never had the birds in the wood told
such a story as that. Klumpey-Dumpey
fell downstairs, and yet came to honor
and married the Princess!</p>

<p>"Yes, so it happens in the world!"
thought the Fir Tree, and believed it
must be true, because that was such a
nice man who told it. "Well, who can
know? Perhaps I shall fall downstairs,
too, and marry a Princess!" And it
looked forward with pleasure to being
adorned again, the next evening, with
candles and toys, gold and fruit. "To-morrow
I shall not tremble," it thought.</p>

<p>"I will rejoice in all my splendor.
To-morrow I shall hear the story of
Klumpey-Dumpey again, and perhaps
that of Ivede-Avede, too."</p>

<p>And the Tree stood all night quiet
and thoughtful.</p>

<p>In the morning the servants and the
chambermaid came in.</p>

<p>"Now my splendor will begin afresh,"
thought the Tree. But they dragged
him out of the room, and upstairs to the
garret, and here they put him in a dark
corner where no daylight shone.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" thought
the Tree. "What am I to do here?
What is to happen?"</p>

<p>And he leaned against the wall, and
thought, and thought. And he had
time enough, for days and nights went
by, and nobody came up; and when at
length someone came, it was only to
put some great boxes in a corner. Now
the Tree stood quite hidden away, and
the supposition is that it was quite
forgotten.</p>

<p>"Now it's winter outside," thought
the Tree. "The earth is hard and
covered with snow, and people cannot
plant me; therefore I suppose I'm to
be sheltered here until spring comes.
How considerate that is! How good
people are! If it were only not so dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
here, and so terribly solitary!&mdash;not even
a little hare? That was pretty out there
in the wood, when the snow lay thick
and the hare sprang past; yes, even
when he jumped over me; but then I
did not like it. It is terribly lonely up
here!"</p>

<p>"Piep! piep!" said a little Mouse, and
crept forward, and then came another
little one. They smelt at the Fir Tree,
and then slipped among the branches.</p>

<p>"It's horribly cold," said the two little
Mice, "or else it would be comfortable
here. Don't you think so, you old Fir
Tree?"</p>

<p>"I'm not old at all," said the Fir
Tree. "There are many much older
than I."</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" asked
the Mice. "And what do you know?"
They were dreadfully inquisitive. "Tell
us about the most beautiful spot on earth.
Have you been there? Have you been in
the store room, where cheeses lie on the
shelves, and hams hang from the ceiling,
where one dances on tallow candles, and
goes in thin and comes out fat?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that," replied the
Tree; "but I know the wood, where
the sun shines and the birds sing."</p>

<p>And then it told all about its youth.</p>

<p>And the little Mice had never heard
anything of the kind; and they listened
and said:</p>

<p>"What a number of things you have
seen! How happy you must have been!"</p>

<p>"I?" replied the Fir Tree; and it
thought about what it had told. "Yes,
those were really quite happy times."
But then he told of the Christmas Eve,
when he had been hung with sweetmeats
and candles.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the little Mice, "how
happy you have been, you old Fir Tree!"</p>

<p>"I'm not old at all," said the Tree.
"I only came out of the wood this winter.
I'm only rather backward in my growth."</p>

<p>"What splendid stories you can tell!"
said the little Mice.</p>

<p>And next night they came with four
other little Mice, to hear what the Tree
had to relate; and the more it said,
the more clearly did it remember everything,
and thought, "Those were quite
merry days! But they may come again.
Klumpey-Dumpey fell downstairs, and
yet he married the Princess. Perhaps
I may marry a Princess too!" And
the Fir Tree thought of a pretty little
Birch Tree that grew out in the forest;
for the Fir Tree, that Birch was a real
Princess.</p>

<p>"Who's Klumpey-Dumpey?" asked
the little Mice.</p>

<p>And then the Fir Tree told the whole
story. It could remember every single
word; and the little Mice were ready to
leap to the very top of the tree with
pleasure. Next night a great many more
Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats
even appeared; but these thought the
story was not pretty, and the little Mice
were sorry for that, for now they also
did not like it so much as before.</p>

<p>"Do you only know one story?"
asked the Rats.</p>

<p>"Only that one," replied the Tree.
"I heard that on the happiest evening
of my life; I did not think then how
happy I was."</p>

<p>"That's a very miserable story. Don't
you know any about bacon and tallow
candles&mdash;a store-room story?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Tree.</p>

<p>"Then we'd rather not hear you,"
said the Rats.</p>

<p>And they went back to their own
people. The little Mice at last stayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
away also; and then the Tree sighed
and said:</p>

<p>"It was very nice when they sat
round me, the merry little Mice, and
listened when I spoke to them. Now
that's past too. But I shall remember
to be pleased when they take me out."</p>

<p>But when did that happen? Why, it
was one morning that people came and
rummaged in the garret: the boxes were
put away, and the Tree brought out;
they certainly threw him rather roughly
on the floor, but a servant dragged him
away at once to the stairs, where the
daylight shone.</p>

<p>"Now life is beginning again!" thought
the Tree.</p>

<p>It felt the fresh air and the first sunbeams,
and now it was out in the courtyard.
Everything passed so quickly that
the Tree quite forgot to look at itself,
there was so much to look at all round.
The courtyard was close to a garden,
and here everything was blooming; the
roses hung fresh and fragrant over the
little paling, the linden trees were in
blossom, and the swallows cried, "Quinze-wit!
quinze-wit! my husband's come!"
But it was not the Fir Tree that they
meant.</p>

<p>"Now I shall live!" said the Tree,
rejoicingly, and spread its branches far
out; but, alas! they were all withered
and yellow; and it lay in the corner
among nettles and weeds. The tinsel
star was still upon it, and shone in the
bright sunshine.</p>

<p>In the courtyard a couple of the merry
children were playing who had danced
round the tree at Christmas time, and
had rejoiced over it. One of the youngest
ran up and tore off the golden star.</p>

<p>"Look what is sticking to the ugly
old fir tree!" said the child, and he
trod upon the branches till they cracked
again under his boots.</p>

<p>And the Tree looked at all the blooming
flowers and the splendor of the garden,
and then looked at itself, and wished it
had remained in the dark corner of the
garret; it thought of its fresh youth in
the wood, of the merry Christmas Eve,
and of the little Mice which had listened
so pleasantly to the story of Klumpey-Dumpey.</p>

<p>"Past! past!" said the old Tree.
"Had I but rejoiced when I could have
done so! Past! past!"</p>

<p>And the servant came and chopped
the Tree into little pieces; a whole
bundle lay there; it blazed brightly
under the great brewing copper, and it
sighed deeply, and each sigh was like
a little shot; and the children who were
at play there ran up and seated themselves
at the fire, looked into it, and
cried "Puff! puff!" But at each explosion,
which was a deep sigh, the Tree
thought of a summer day in the woods,
or of a winter night there, when the
stars beamed; he thought of Christmas
Eve and of Klumpey-Dumpey, the only
story he had ever heard or knew how to
tell; and then the Tree was burned.</p>

<p>The boys played in the garden, and
the youngest had on his breast a golden
star, which the Tree had worn on its
happiest evening. Now that was past,
and the Tree's life was past, and the
story is past too: past! past!&mdash;and
that's the way with all stories.</p>

<div class="hang1">The tale that follows was one of the author's
earliest stories, published in 1835. It is
clearly based upon an old folk tale, one
variant of which is "The Blue Light" from
the Grimm collection (No. <a href="#Note_174">174</a>). "It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
a lucky stroke," says Brandes, "that made
Andersen the poet of children. After long
fumbling, after unsuccessful efforts, which
must necessarily throw a false and ironic
light on the self-consciousness of a poet
whose pride based its justification mainly
on the expectancy of a future which he
felt slumbering within his soul, after
wandering about for long years, Andersen
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one evening found himself in front
of a little insignificant yet mysterious door,
the door of the nursery story. He touched
it, it yielded, and he saw, burning in the
obscurity within, the little 'Tinder-Box'
that became his Aladdin's lamp. He struck
fire with it, and the spirits of the lamp&mdash;the
dogs with eyes as large as tea-cups, as
mill-wheels, as the round tower in Copenhagen&mdash;stood
before him and brought him
the three giant chests, containing all the
copper, silver, and gold treasure stories of
the nursery story. The first story had
sprung into existence, and the 'Tinder-Box'
drew all the others onward in its train.
Happy is he who has found his 'tinder-box.'"

<h4><br />THE TINDER-BOX</h4>

<div class='center'>HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</div>

<p>There came a soldier marching along
the high road&mdash;<i>one, two! one, two!</i> He
had his knapsack on his back and a saber
by his side, for he had been in the wars,
and now he wanted to go home. And on
the way he met with an old witch; she
was very hideous, and her under lip hung
down upon her breast. She said, "Good
evening, soldier. What a fine sword you
have, and what a big knapsack! You're
a proper soldier! Now you shall have
as much money as you like to have."</p>

<p>"I thank you, you old witch!" said
the soldier.</p>

<p>"Do you see that great tree?" quoth
the witch; and she pointed to a tree
which stood beside them. "It's quite
hollow inside. You must climb to the
top, and then you'll see a hole, through
which you can let yourself down and
get deep into the tree. I'll tie a rope
round your body, so that I can pull you
up again when you call me."</p>

<p>"What am I to do down in the tree?"
asked the soldier.</p>

<p>"Get money," replied the witch.
"Listen to me. When you come down
to the earth under the tree, you will
find yourself in a great hall: it is quite
light, for above three hundred lamps are
burning there. Then you will see three
doors; those you can open, for the keys
are hanging there. If you go into the
first chamber, you'll see a great chest
in the middle of the floor; on this chest
sits a dog, and he's got a pair of eyes
as big as two tea-cups. But you need
not care for that. I'll give you my
blue-checked apron, and you can spread
it out upon the floor; then go up quickly
and take the dog, and set him on my
apron; then open the chest, and take
as many shillings as you like. They are
of copper: if you prefer silver, you must
go into the second chamber. But there
sits a dog with a pair of eyes as big as
mill-wheels. But do not you care for
that. Set him upon my apron, and take
some of the money. And if you want
gold, you can have that too&mdash;in fact,
as much as you can carry&mdash;if you go
into the third chamber. But the dog
that sits on the money-chest there has
two eyes as big as round towers. He is
a fierce dog, you may be sure; but you
needn't be afraid, for all that. Only
set him on my apron, and he won't
hurt you; and take out of the chest as
much gold as you like."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's not so bad," said the soldier.
"But what am I to give you, old witch?
for you will not do it for nothing, I fancy."</p>

<p>"No," replied the witch, "not a single
shilling will I have. You shall only
bring me an old tinder-box which my
grandmother forgot when she was down
there last."</p>

<p>"Then tie the rope round my body,"
cried the soldier.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said the witch, "and
here's my blue-checked apron."</p>

<p>Then the soldier climbed up into the
tree, let himself slip down into the hole,
and stood, as the witch had said, in the
great hall where the three hundred lamps
were burning.</p>

<p>Now he opened the first door. Ugh!
there sat the dog with eyes as big as
tea-cups, staring at him. "You're a
nice fellow!" exclaimed the soldier; and
he set him on the witch's apron, and
took as many copper shillings as his
pockets would hold, and then locked
the chest, set the dog on it again, and
went into the second chamber. Aha!
there sat the dog with eyes as big as
mill-wheels.</p>

<p>"You should not stare so hard at
me," said the soldier; "you might strain
your eyes." And he set the dog upon
the witch's apron. And when he saw
the silver money in the chest, he threw
away all the copper money he had, and
filled his pocket and his knapsack with
silver only. Then he went into the
third chamber. Oh, but that was horrid!
The dog there really had eyes as big as
towers, and they turned round and
round in his head like wheels.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" said the soldier; and
he touched his cap, for he had never
seen such a dog as that before. When
he had looked at him a little more closely,
he thought, "That will do," and lifted
him down to the floor, and opened the
chest. Mercy! what a quantity of gold
was there! He could buy with it the
whole town, and the sugar sucking-pigs
of the cake woman, and all the tin
soldiers, whips, and rocking-horses in the
whole world. Yes, that was a quantity
of money! Now the soldier threw away
all the silver coin with which he had
filled his pockets and his knapsack, and
took gold instead: yes, all his pockets, his
knapsack, his boots, and his cap were
filled, so that he could scarcely walk.
Now indeed he had plenty of money.
He put the dog on the chest, shut the
door, and then called up through the
tree, "Now pull me up, you old witch."</p>

<p>"Have you the tinder-box?" asked
the witch.</p>

<p>"Plague on it!" exclaimed the soldier,
"I had clean forgotten that." And he
went and brought it.</p>

<p>The witch drew him up, and he stood
on the high road again, with pockets,
boots, knapsack, and cap full of gold.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with the
tinder-box?" asked the soldier.</p>

<p>"That's nothing to you," retorted
the witch. "You've had your money&mdash;just
give me the tinder-box."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the soldier. "Tell
me directly what you're going to do
with it, or I'll draw my sword and cut
off your head."</p>

<p>"No!" cried the witch.</p>

<p>So the soldier cut off her head. There
she lay! But he tied up all his money
in her apron, took it on his back like a
bundle, put the tinder-box in his pocket,
and went straight off toward the town.</p>

<p>That was a splendid town! And he
put up at the very best inn and asked
for the finest rooms, and ordered his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
favorite dishes, for now he was rich, as
he had so much money. The servant
who had to clean his boots certainly
thought them a remarkably old pair for
such a rich gentleman; but he had not
bought any new ones yet. The next
day he procured proper boots and handsome
clothes. Now our soldier had
become a fine gentleman; and the people
told him of all the splendid things which
were in their city, and about the King,
and what a pretty Princess the King's
daughter was.</p>

<p>"Where can one get to see her?"
asked the soldier.</p>

<p>"She is not to be seen at all," said
they, all together; "she lives in a great
copper castle, with a great many walls
and towers round about it; no one but
the King may go in and out there, for
it has been prophesied that she shall
marry a common soldier, and the King
can't bear that."</p>

<p>"I should like to see her," thought the
soldier; but he could not get leave to
do so. Now he lived merrily, went to
the theater, drove in the King's garden,
and gave much money to the poor; and
this was very kind of him, for he knew
from old times how hard it is when one
has not a shilling. Now he was rich,
had fine clothes, and gained many
friends, who all said he was a rare one,
a true cavalier; and that pleased the
soldier well. But as he spent money
every day and never earned any, he
had at last only two shillings left; and
he was obliged to turn out of the fine
rooms in which he had dwelt, and had
to live in a little garret under the roof,
and clean his boots for himself, and mend
them with a darning-needle. None of
his friends came to see him, for there
were too many stairs to climb.</p>

<p>It was quite dark one evening, and
he could not even buy himself a candle,
when it occurred to him that there was a
candle-end in the tinder-box which he
had taken out of the hollow tree into
which the witch had helped him. He
brought out the tinder-box and the
candle-end; but as soon as he struck
fire and the sparks rose up from the
flint, the door flew open, and the dog
who had eyes as big as a couple of tea-cups,
and whom he had seen in the tree,
stood before him, and said:</p>

<p>"What are my lord's commands?"</p>

<p>"What is this?" said the soldier.
"That's a famous tinder-box, if I can
get everything with it that I want!
Bring me some money," said he to the
dog: and <i>whisk!</i> the dog was gone, and
<i>whisk!</i> he was back again, with a great
bag full of shillings in his mouth.</p>

<p>Now the soldier knew what a capital
tinder-box this was. If he struck it
once, the dog came who sat upon the
chest of copper money; if he struck it
twice, the dog came who had the silver;
and if he struck it three times, then
appeared the dog who had the gold.
Now the soldier moved back into the fine
rooms, and appeared again in handsome
clothes; and all his friends knew him again,
and cared very much for him indeed.</p>

<p>Once he thought to himself, "It is a
very strange thing that one cannot get
to see the Princess. They all say she is
very beautiful; but what is the use of
that, if she has always to sit in the great
copper castle with the many towers?
Can I not get to see her at all? Where
is my tinder-box?" And so he struck
a light, and <i>whisk!</i> came the dog with
eyes as big as tea-cups.</p>

<p>"It is midnight, certainly," said the
soldier, "but I should very much like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to see the Princess, only for one little
moment."</p>

<p>And the dog was outside the door
directly, and, before the soldier thought
it, came back with the Princess. She
sat upon the dog's back and slept; and
everyone could see she was a real Princess,
for she was so lovely. The soldier
could not refrain from kissing her, for
he was a thorough soldier. Then the
dog ran back again with the Princess.
But when morning came, and the King
and Queen were drinking tea, the Princess
said she had had a strange dream,
the night before, about a dog and a
soldier&mdash;that she had ridden upon the
dog, and the soldier had kissed her.</p>

<p>"That would be a fine history!" said
the Queen.</p>

<p>So one of the old Court ladies had to
watch the next night by the Princess's
bed, to see if this was really a dream, or
what it might be.</p>

<p>The soldier had a great longing to see
the lovely Princess again; so the dog
came in the night, took her away, and
ran as fast as he could. But the old
lady put on water-boots, and ran just
as fast after him. When she saw that
they both entered a great house, she
thought, "Now I know where it is";
and with a bit of chalk she drew a great
cross on the door. Then she went home
and lay down, and the dog came up
with the Princess; but when he saw that
there was a cross drawn on the door
where the soldier lived, he took a piece
of chalk too, and drew crosses on all
the doors in the town. And that was
cleverly done, for now the lady could not
find the right door, because all the doors
had crosses upon them.</p>

<p>In the morning early came the King
and the Queen, the old Court lady and
all the officers, to see where it was the
Princess had been. "Here it is!" said
the King, when he saw the first door
with a cross upon it. "No, my dear
husband, it is there!" said the Queen,
who descried another door which also
showed a cross. "But there is one, and
there is one!" said all, for wherever they
looked there were crosses on the doors.
So they saw that it would avail them
nothing if they searched on.</p>

<p>But the Queen was an exceedingly
clever woman, who could do more than
ride in a coach. She took her great
gold scissors, cut a piece of silk into
pieces, and made a neat little bag: this
bag she filled with fine wheat flour, and
tied it on the Princess's back; and when
that was done, she cut a little hole in
the bag, so that the flour would be
scattered along all the way which the
Princess should take.</p>

<p>In the night the dog came again, took
the Princess on his back, and ran with
her to the soldier, who loved her very
much, and would gladly have been a
prince, so that he might have her for
his wife. The dog did not notice at all
how the flour ran out in a stream from
the castle to the windows of the soldier's
house, where he ran up the wall with
the Princess. In the morning the King
and Queen saw well enough where their
daughter had been, and they took the
soldier and put him in prison.</p>

<p>There he sat. Oh, but it was dark
and disagreeable there! And they said
to him, "To-morrow you shall be hanged."
That was not amusing to hear, and he
had left his tinder-box at the inn. In
the morning he could see, through the
iron grating of the little window, how
the people were hurrying out of the
town to see him hanged. He heard the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
drums beat and saw the soldiers marching.
All the people were running out,
and among them was a shoemaker's boy
with leather apron and slippers, and he
galloped so fast that one of his slippers
flew off, and came right against the wall
where the soldier sat looking through
the iron grating.</p>

<p>"Halloo, you shoemaker's boy! you
needn't be in such a hurry," cried the
soldier to him: "it will not begin till I
come. But if you will run to where I
lived, and bring me my tinder-box, you
shall have four shillings; but you must
put your best leg foremost."</p>

<p>The shoemaker's boy wanted to get
the four shillings, so he went and
brought the tinder-box, and&mdash;well, we
shall hear now what happened.</p>

<p>Outside the town a great gallows had
been built, and around it stood the
soldiers and many hundred thousand
people. The King and Queen sat on
a splendid throne, opposite to the
Judges and the whole Council. The
soldier already stood upon the ladder;
but as they were about to put the rope
round his neck, he said that before a
poor criminal suffered his punishment
an innocent request was always granted
to him. He wanted very much to smoke
a pipe of tobacco, as it would be the last
pipe he should smoke in this world.
The King would not say "No" to this;
so the soldier took his tinder-box and
struck fire. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;! and
there suddenly stood all the dogs&mdash;the
one with eyes as big as tea-cups, the one
with eyes as large as mill-wheels, and
the one whose eyes were as big as round
towers.</p>

<p>"Help me now, so that I may not
be hanged," said the soldier. And the
dogs fell upon the Judge and all the
Council, seized one by the leg and another
by the nose, and tossed them all many
feet into the air, so that they fell down
and were all broken to pieces.</p>

<p>"I won't!" cried the King; but the
biggest dog took him and the Queen and
threw them after the others. Then the
soldiers were afraid, and the people cried,
"Little soldier, you shall be our King,
and marry the beautiful Princess!"</p>

<p>So they put the soldier into the King's
coach, and all the three dogs darted on
in front and cried "Hurrah!" and the
boys whistled through their fingers, and
the soldiers presented arms. The Princess
came out of the copper castle, and
became Queen, and she liked that well
enough. The wedding lasted a week,
and the three dogs sat at the table too,
and opened their eyes wider than ever
at all they saw.</p>

<div class="hang1">The following is one of Andersen's early
stories, published in 1838. It has always
been a great favorite. Whimsically odd
couples, in this case so constant in their
devotion to each other, seemed to appeal
to Andersen. The romance of the Whip
Top and the Ball in the little story "The
Lovers" deals with another odd couple.
"Constant" or "steadfast" are terms sometimes
used in the different versions instead
of "hardy," and, if they seem better to
carry the meaning intended, teachers
should feel free to substitute one of them
in telling or reading the story. The translation

<h4><br />THE HARDY TIN SOLDIER</h4>

<div class='center'>HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</div>

<p>There were once five-and-twenty tin
soldiers; they were all brothers, for they
had all been born of one old tin spoon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
They shouldered their muskets, and
looked straight before them; their uniform
was red and blue, and very splendid.
The first thing they had heard in the
world, when the lid was taken off their
box, had been the words, "Tin soldiers!"
These words were uttered by a little boy,
clapping his hands: the soldiers had been
given to him, for it was his birthday;
and now he put them upon the table.
Each soldier was exactly like the rest;
but one of them had been cast last of
all, and there had not been enough tin
to finish him; but he stood as firmly
upon his one leg as the others on their
two; and it was just this Soldier who
became remarkable.</p>

<p>On the table on which they had been
placed stood many other playthings, but
the toy that attracted most attention
was a neat castle of cardboard. Through
the little windows one could see straight
into the hall. Before the castle some
little trees were placed round a little
looking-glass, which was to represent
a clear lake. Waxen swans swam on
this lake, and were mirrored in it. This
was all very pretty; but the prettiest
of all was a little lady, who stood at
the open door of the castle; she was
also cut out in paper, but she had a
dress of the clearest gauze, and a little
narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders,
that looked like a scarf; and in the
middle of this ribbon was a shining
tinsel rose as big as her whole face.
The little lady stretched out both her
arms, for she was a dancer; and then she
lifted one leg so high that the Tin
Soldier could not see it at all, and
thought that, like himself, she had but
one leg.</p>

<p>"That would be the wife for me,"
thought he; "but she is very grand.
She lives in a castle, and I have only a
box, and there are five-and-twenty of us
in that. It is no place for her. But I
must try to make acquaintance with her."</p>

<p>And then he lay down at full length
behind a snuff-box which was on the
table; there he could easily watch the
little dainty lady, who continued to
stand upon one leg without losing her
balance.</p>

<p>When the evening came all the other
tin soldiers were put into their box, and
the people in the house went to bed.
Now the toys began to play at "visiting,"
and at "war," and "giving balls." The
tin soldiers rattled in their box, for they
wanted to join, but could not lift the
lid. The nutcracker threw somersaults,
and the pencil amused itself on the table;
there was so much noise that the canary
woke up, and began to speak too, and
even in verse. The only two who did
not stir from their places were the Tin
Soldier and the Dancing Lady: she
stood straight up on the point of one of
her toes, and stretched out both her
arms; and he was just as enduring on
his one leg; and he never turned his
eyes away from her.</p>

<p>Now the clock struck twelve&mdash;and,
bounce! the lid flew off the snuff-box;
but there was no snuff in it, but a little
black Goblin: you see, it was a trick.</p>

<p>"Tin Soldier!" said the Goblin, "don't
stare at things that don't concern you."</p>

<p>But the Tin Soldier pretended not to
hear him.</p>

<p>"Just you wait till to-morrow!" said
the Goblin.</p>

<p>But when the morning came, and the
children got up, the Tin Soldier was
placed in the window; and whether it
was the Goblin or the draught that did
it, all at once the window flew open,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and the Soldier fell head over heels out
of the third story. That was a terrible
passage! He put his leg straight up,
and stuck with helmet downward and
his bayonet between the paving-stones.</p>

<p>The servant-maid and the little boy
came down directly to look for him, but
though they almost trod upon him, they
could not see him. If the Soldier had
cried out "Here I am!" they would have
found him; but he did not think it
fitting to call out loudly, because he
was in uniform.</p>

<p>Now it began to rain; the drops soon
fell thicker, and at last it came down into
a complete stream. When the rain was
past, two street boys came by.</p>

<p>"Just look!" said one of them, "there
lies a Tin Soldier. He must come out
and ride in the boat."</p>

<p>And they made a boat out of a newspaper,
and put the Tin Soldier in the
middle of it, and so he sailed down the
gutter, and the two boys ran beside him
and clapped their hands. Goodness preserve
us! how the waves rose in that
gutter, and how fast the stream ran!
But then it had been a heavy rain. The
paper boat rocked up and down, and
sometimes turned round so rapidly that
the Tin Soldier trembled; but he
remained firm, and never changed countenance,
and looked straight before him,
and shouldered his musket.</p>

<p>All at once the boat went into a long
drain, and it became as dark as if he had
been in his box.</p>

<p>"Where am I going now?" he thought.
"Yes, yes, that's the Goblin's fault.
Ah! if the little lady only sat here with
me in the boat, it might be twice as dark
for what I should care."</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a great Water
Rat, which lived under the drain.</p>

<p>"Have you a passport?" said the Rat.
"Give me your passport."</p>

<p>But the Tin Soldier kept silence, and
held his musket tighter than ever.</p>

<p>The boat went on, but the Rat came
after it. Hu! how he gnashed his teeth,
and called out to the bits of straw and
wood:</p>

<p>"Hold him! hold him! He hasn't
paid toll&mdash;he hasn't shown his passport!"</p>

<p>But the stream became stronger and
stronger. The Tin Soldier could see the
bright daylight where the arch ended;
but he heard a roaring noise which
might well frighten a bolder man. Only
think&mdash;just where the tunnel ended, the
drain ran into a great canal; and for
him that would have been as dangerous
as for us to be carried down a great
waterfall.</p>

<p>Now he was already so near it that
he could not stop. The boat was carried
out, the poor Tin Soldier stiffening himself
as much as he could, and no one
could say that he moved an eyelid. The
boat whirled round three or four times,
and was full of water to the very edge&mdash;it
must sink. The Tin Soldier stood up
to his neck in water, and the boat sank
deeper and deeper, and the paper was
loosened more and more; and now the
water closed over the soldier's head.
Then he thought of the pretty little
Dancer, and how he should never see
her again; and it sounded in the soldier's
ears:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Farewell, farewell, thou <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'warrier'">warrior</ins> brave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For this day thou must die!</span><br />
</div>

<p>And now the paper parted, and the
Tin Soldier fell out; but at that moment
he was snapped up by a great fish.</p>

<p>Oh, how dark it was in that fish's
body! It was darker yet than in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
drain tunnel; and then it was very narrow
too. But the Tin Soldier remained
unmoved, and lay at full length shouldering
his musket.</p>

<p>The fish swam to and fro; he made the
most wonderful movements, and then
became quite still. At last something
flashed through him like lightning. The
daylight shone quite clear, and a voice
said aloud, "The Tin Soldier!" The
fish had been caught, carried to market,
bought, and taken into the kitchen,
where the cook cut him open with a
large knife. She seized the Soldier
round the body with both her hands
and carried him into the room, where
all were anxious to see the remarkable
man who had traveled about in the
inside of a fish; but the Tin Soldier was
not at all proud. They placed him on
the table, and there&mdash;no! What curious
things may happen in the world. The
Tin Soldier was in the very room in
which he had been before! He saw the
same children, and the same toys stood
on the table; and there was the pretty
castle with the graceful little Dancer.
She was still balancing herself on one
leg, and held the other extended in the
air. She was hardy too. That moved
the Tin Soldier; he was very nearly
weeping tin tears, but that would not
have been proper. He looked at her,
but they said nothing to each other.</p>

<p>Then one of the little boys took the
Tin Soldier and flung him into the stove.
He gave no reason for doing this. It
must have been the fault of the Goblin
in the snuff-box.</p>

<p>The Tin Soldier stood there quite
illuminated, and felt a heat that was
terrible; but whether this heat proceeded
from the real fire or from love he did not
know. The colors had quite gone off
from him; but whether that had happened
on the journey, or had been
caused by grief, no one could say. He
looked at the little lady, she looked at
him, and he felt that he was melting;
but he still stood firm, shouldering his
musket. Then suddenly the door flew
open, and the draught of air caught the
Dancer, and she flew like a sylph just
into the stove to the Tin Soldier, and
flashed up in a flame, and she was gone.
Then the Tin Soldier melted down into a
lump; and when the servant-maid took
the ashes out next day, she found him
in the shape of a little tin heart. But
of the Dancer nothing remained but the
tinsel rose, and that was burned as
black as a coal.</p>

<div class="hang1">"The Ugly Duckling" has always been
regarded as one of Andersen's most exquisite
stories. No one can fail to notice the
parallel that suggests itself between the
successive stages in the duckling's history
and those in Andersen's own life. In this
story, remarks Dr. Brandes, "there is the
quintessence of the author's entire life
(melancholy, humor, martyrdom, triumph)
and of his whole nature: the gift of observation
and the sparkling intellect which
he used to avenge himself upon folly and
wickedness, the varied faculties which constitute
his genius." The standards of
judgment used by the ducks, the turkey,
the hen, and the cat are all delightfully
and humorously satirical of human stupidity
and shortsightedness. The translation

<h4><br />THE UGLY DUCKLING</h4>

<div class='center'>HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</div>

<p>It was glorious out in the country. It
was summer, and the cornfields were
yellow, and the oats were green; the hay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
had been put up in stacks in the green
meadows, and the stork went about on
his long red legs, and chattered Egyptian,
for this was the language he had learned
from his good mother. All around the
fields and meadows were great forests,
and in the midst of these forests lay deep
lakes. Yes, it was really glorious out
in the country. In the midst of the sunshine
there lay an old farm, surrounded
by deep canals, and from the wall down
to the water grew great burdocks, so high
that little children could stand upright
under the loftiest of them. It was just
as wild there as in the deepest wood.
Here sat a Duck upon her nest, for she
had to hatch her young ones; but she was
almost tired out before the little ones came;
and then she so seldom had visitors. The
other ducks liked better to swim about
in the canals than to run up to sit down
under a burdock and cackle with her.</p>

<p>At last one eggshell after another burst
open. "Piep! piep!" it cried, and in all
the eggs there were little creatures that
stuck out their heads.</p>

<p>"Rap! rap!" they said; and they all
came rapping out as fast as they could,
looking all round them under the green
leaves; and the mother let them look as
much as they chose, for green is good for
the eyes.</p>

<p>"How wide the world is!" said the
young ones, for they certainly had much
more room now than when they were in
the eggs.</p>

<p>"Do you think this is all the world!"
asked the mother. "That extends far
across the other side of the garden, quite
into the parson's field, but I have never
been there yet. I hope you are all together,"
she continued, and stood up.
"No, I have not all. The largest egg
still lies there. How long is that to last?
I am really tired of it." And she sat
down again.</p>

<p>"Well, how goes it?" asked an old
Duck who had come to pay her a visit.</p>

<p>"It lasts a long time with that one
egg," said the Duck who sat there. "It
will not burst. Now, only look at the
others; are they not the prettiest ducks
one could possibly see? They are all
like their father; the bad fellow never
comes to see me."</p>

<p>"Let me see the egg which will not
burst," said the old visitor. "Believe
me, it is a turkey's egg. I was once
cheated in that way, and had much
anxiety and trouble with the young ones,
for they are afraid of the water. I could
not get them to venture in. I quacked
and clucked, but it was of no use. Let
me see the egg. Yes, that's a turkey's
egg! Let it lie there, and you teach the
other children to swim."</p>

<p>"I think I will sit on it a little longer,"
said the Duck. "I've sat so long now
that I can sit a few days more."</p>

<p>"Just as you please," said the old Duck;
and she went away.</p>

<p>At last the great egg burst. "Piep!
piep!" said the little one, and crept forth.
It was very large and very ugly. The
Duck looked at it.</p>

<p>"It's a very large duckling," said she;
"none of the others look like that; can
it really be a turkey chick? Now we
shall soon find out. It must go into
the water, even if I have to thrust it
in myself."</p>

<p>The next day the weather was splendidly
bright, and the sun shone on all the
green trees. The Mother-Duck went
down to the water with all her little ones.
Splash! she jumped into the water.
"Quack! quack!" she said, and then one
duckling after another plunged in. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
water closed over their heads, but they
came up in an instant, and swam capitally;
their legs went of themselves, and
there they were, all in the water. The
ugly gray Duckling swam with them.</p>

<p>"No, it's not a turkey," said she;
"look how well it can use its legs, and
how upright it holds itself. It is my own
child! On the whole it's quite pretty,
if one looks at it rightly. Quack! quack!
come with me, and I'll lead you out into
the great world, and present you in the
poultry-yard; but keep close to me, so
that no one may tread on you; and take
care of the cats!"</p>

<p>And so they came into the poultry-yard.
There was a terrible riot going on
in there, for two families were quarreling
about an eel's head, and the cat got it
after all.</p>

<p>"See, that's how it goes in the world!"
said the Mother-Duck; and she whetted
her beak, for she, too, wanted the eel's
head. "Only use your legs," she said.
"See that you bustle about, and bow your
heads before the old Duck yonder.
She's the grandest of all here; she's of
Spanish blood&mdash;that's why she's so fat;
and do you see, she has a red rag round
her leg; that's something particularly
fine, and the greatest distinction a duck
can enjoy; it signifies that one does not
want to lose her, and that she's to be
recognized by man and beast. Shake
yourselves&mdash;don't turn in your toes; a
well-brought-up Duck turns its toes
quite out, just like father and mother, so!
Now bend your necks and say 'Rap!'"</p>

<p>And they did so; but the other Ducks
round about looked at them, and said
quite boldly:</p>

<p>"Look there! now we're to have these
hanging on, as if there were not enough
of us already! And&mdash;fie&mdash;! how that
Duckling yonder looks; we won't stand
that!" And one duck flew up immediately,
and bit it in the neck.</p>

<p>"Let it alone," said the mother; "it
does no harm to anyone."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's too large and peculiar,"
said the Duck who had bitten it; "and
therefore it must be buffeted."</p>

<p>"Those are pretty children that the
mother has there," said the old Duck
with the rag round her leg. "They're
all pretty but that one; that was a failure.
I wish she could alter it."</p>

<p>"That cannot be done, my lady,"
replied the Mother-Duck. "It is not
pretty, but it has a really good disposition,
and swims as well as any other; I
may even say it swims better. I think
it will grow up pretty, and become
smaller in time; it has lain too long in
the egg, and therefore is not properly
shaped." And then she pinched it in
the neck, and smoothed its feathers.
"Moreover, it is a drake," she said, "and
therefore it is not of so much consequence.
I think he will be very strong; he makes
his way already."</p>

<p>"The other ducklings are graceful
enough," said the old Duck. "Make
yourself at home; and if you find an eel's
head, you may bring it me."</p>

<p>And now they were at home. But
the poor Duckling which had crept last
out of the egg, and looked so ugly, was
bitten and pushed and jeered, as much by
the ducks as by the chickens.</p>

<p>"It is too big!" they all said. And
the turkey-cock, who had been born
with spurs, and therefore thought himself
an Emperor, blew himself up like a ship
in full sail, and bore straight down upon
it; then he gobbled, and grew quite red
in the face. The poor Duckling did not
know where it should stand or walk;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
it was quite melancholy, because it looked
ugly and was scoffed at by the whole yard.</p>

<p>So it went on the first day; and afterward
it became worse and worse. The
poor Duckling was hunted about by
every one; even its brothers and sisters
were quite angry with it, and said, "If
the cat would only catch you, you ugly
creature!" And the mother said, "If you
were only far away!" And the ducks bit
it, and the chickens beat it, and the girl
who had to feed the poultry kicked at it
with her foot.</p>

<p>Then it ran and flew over the fence,
and the little birds in the bushes flew up
in fear.</p>

<p>"That is because I am so ugly!"
thought the Duckling; and it shut its
eyes, but flew no farther; thus it came
out into the great moor, where the Wild
Ducks lived. Here it lay the whole night
long; and it was weary and downcast.</p>

<p>Toward morning the Wild Ducks flew
up, and looked at their new companion.</p>

<p>"What sort of a one are you?" they
asked; and the Duckling turned in every
direction, and bowed as well as it could.
"You are remarkably ugly!" said the
Wild Ducks. "But that is very indifferent
to us, so long as you do not marry
into our family."</p>

<p>Poor thing! It certainly did not think
of marrying, and only hoped to obtain
leave to lie among the reeds and drink
some of the swamp-water.</p>

<p>Thus it lay two whole days; then came
thither two Wild Geese, or, properly
speaking, two wild ganders. It was not
long since each had crept out of an egg,
and that's why they were so saucy.</p>

<p>"Listen, comrade," said one of them.
"You're so ugly that I like you. Will
you go with us, and become a bird of
passage? Near here, in another moor,
there are a few sweet lovely wild geese,
all unmarried, and all able to say, 'Rap!'
You've a chance of making your fortune,
ugly as you are!"</p>

<p>"Piff! paff!" resounded through the
air; and the two ganders fell down dead
in the swamp, and the water became
blood-red. "Piff! paff!" it sounded
again, and whole flocks of wild geese rose
up from the reeds. And then there was
another report. A great hunt was going
on. The hunters were lying in wait all
round the moor, and some were even
sitting up in the branches of the trees,
which spread far over the reeds. The
blue smoke rose up like clouds among the
dark trees, and was wafted far away
across the water; and the hunting dogs
came&mdash;splash, splash!&mdash;into the swamp,
and the rushes and the reeds bent down
on every side. That was a fright for the
poor Duckling! It turned its head, and
put it under its wing; but at that moment
a frightful great dog stood close by the
Duckling. His tongue hung far out of
his mouth and his eyes gleamed horrible
and ugly; he thrust out his nose close
against the Duckling, showed his sharp
teeth, and&mdash;splash, splash!&mdash;on he went
without seizing it.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven be thanked!" sighed the
Duckling. "I am so ugly that even the
dog does not like to bite me!"</p>

<p>And so it lay quite quiet, while the
shots rattled through the reeds and gun
after gun was fired. At last, late in the
day, silence was restored; but the poor
Duckling did not dare to rise up; it waited
several hours before it looked round, and
then hastened away out of the moor as
fast as it could. It ran on over field and
meadow; there was such a storm raging
that it was difficult to get from one place
to another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward evening the Duck came to a
little miserable peasant's hut. This hut
was so dilapidated that it did not know
on which side it should fall; and that's
why it remained standing. The storm
whistled round the Duckling in such a
way that the poor creature was obliged
to sit down, to stand against it; and the
tempest grew worse and worse. Then
the Duckling noticed that one of the
hinges of the door had given way, and
the door hung so slanting that the Duckling
could slip through the crack into the
room; and it did so.</p>

<p>Here lived a woman with her Tom Cat
and her Hen. And the Tom Cat, whom
she called Sonnie, could arch his back and
purr. He could even give out sparks; but
for that one had to stroke his fur the
wrong way. The Hen had quite little
short legs, and therefore she was called
Chickabiddy-shortshanks; she laid good
eggs, and the woman loved her as her
own child.</p>

<p>In the morning the strange Duckling
was at once noticed, and the Tom Cat
began to purr, and the Hen to cluck.</p>

<p>"What's this?" said the woman, and
looked all round; but she could not see
well, and therefore she thought the Duckling
was a fat duck that had strayed.
"This is a rare prize," she said. "Now
I shall have duck's eggs. I hope it is
not a drake. We must try that."</p>

<p>And so the Duckling was admitted on
trial for three weeks; but no eggs came.
And the Tom Cat was master of the
house, and the Hen was the lady, and
they always said, "We and the world!"
for they thought they were half the world,
and by far the better half. The Duckling
thought one might have a different
opinion, but the Hen would not allow it.</p>

<p>"Can you lay eggs?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then you'll have the goodness to
hold your tongue."</p>

<p>And the Tom Cat said, "Can you curve
your back, and purr, and give out
sparks?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then you cannot have any opinion
of your own when sensible people are
speaking."</p>

<p>And the Duckling sat in a corner and
was melancholy; then the fresh air and
the sunshine streamed in; and it was
seized with such a strange longing to swim
on the water that it could not help telling
the Hen of it.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of?" cried the
Hen. "You have nothing to do; that's
why you have these fancies. Purr or
lay eggs, and they will pass over."</p>

<p>"But it is so charming to swim on the
water!" said the Duckling, "so refreshing
to let it close above one's head, and to
dive down to the bottom."</p>

<p>"Yes, that must be a mighty pleasure,
truly," quoth the Hen. "I fancy you
must have gone crazy. Ask the Cat
about it&mdash;he's the cleverest animal I
know&mdash;ask him if he likes to swim on
the water, or to dive down: I won't
speak about myself. Ask our mistress,
the old woman; no one in the world is
cleverer than she. Do you think she
has any desire to swim, and to let the
water close above her head?"</p>

<p>"You don't understand me," said the
Duckling.</p>

<p>"We don't understand you? Then
pray who is to understand you? You
surely don't pretend to be cleverer than
the Tom Cat and the old woman&mdash;I
won't say anything of myself. Don't be
conceited, child, and be grateful for all
the kindness you have received. Did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
you not get into a warm room, and have
you not fallen into company from which
you may learn something? But you are
a chatterer, and it is not pleasant to associate
with you. You may believe me, I
speak for your good. I tell you disagreeable
things, and by that one may always
know one's true friends. Only take care
that you learn to lay eggs, or to purr and
give out sparks!"</p>

<p>"I think I will go out into the wide
world," said the Duckling.</p>

<p>"Yes, do go," replied the Hen.</p>

<p>And the Duckling went away. It
swam on the water, and dived, but it was
slighted by every creature because of its
ugliness.</p>

<p>Now came the autumn. The leaves
in the forest turned yellow and brown;
the wind caught them so that they danced
about, and up in the air it was very cold.
The clouds hung low, heavy with hail
and snow-flakes, and on the fence stood
the raven, crying, "Croak! croak!" for
mere cold; yes, it was enough to make
one feel cold to think of this. The poor
little Duckling certainly had not a good
time. One evening&mdash;the sun was just
setting in his beauty&mdash;there came a
whole flock of great handsome birds out
of the bushes; they were dazzlingly white,
with long flexible necks; they were swans.
They uttered a very peculiar cry, spread
forth their glorious great wings, and
flew away from that cold region to warmer
lands, to fair open lakes. They mounted
so high, so high! and the ugly little Duckling
felt quite strange as it watched
them. It turned round and round in the
water like a wheel, stretched out its neck
toward them, and uttered such a strange
loud cry as frightened itself. Oh! it
could not forget those beautiful, happy
birds; and so soon as it could see them no
longer, it dived down to the very bottom,
and when it came up again, it was quite
beside itself. It knew not the name of
those birds, and knew not whither they
were flying; but it loved them more than
it had ever loved anyone. It was not
at all envious of them. How could it
think of wishing to possess such loveliness
as they had? It would have been glad
if only the ducks would have endured its
company&mdash;the poor ugly creature!</p>

<p>And the winter grew cold, very cold!
The Duckling was forced to swim about
in the water, to prevent the surface from
freezing entirely; but every night the
hole in which it swam about became
smaller and smaller. It froze so hard
that the icy covering crackled again; and
the Duckling was obliged to use its legs
continually to prevent the hole from
freezing up. At last it became exhausted,
and lay quite still, and thus froze fast
into the ice.</p>

<p>Early in the morning a peasant came
by, and when he saw what had happened,
he took his wooden shoe, broke the ice-crust
to pieces, and carried the Duckling
home to his wife. Then it came to itself
again. The children wanted to play with
it; but the Duckling thought they would
do it an injury, and in its terror fluttered
up into the milk-pan, so that the milk
spurted down into the room. The
woman clapped her hands, at which the
Duckling flew down into the butter-tub,
and then into the meal-barrel and out
again. How it looked then! The woman
screamed, and struck at it with the
fire-tongs; the children tumbled over one
another in their efforts to catch the
Duckling; and they laughed and screamed
finely. Happily the door stood open,
and the poor creature was able to slip
out between the shrubs into the newly-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>fallen
snow; and there it lay quite
exhausted.</p>

<p>But it would be too melancholy if I
were to tell all the misery and care which
the Duckling had to endure in the hard
winter. It lay out on the moor among
the reeds when the sun began to shine
again and the larks to sing; it was a
beautiful spring.</p>

<p>Then all at once the Duckling could
flap its wings; they beat the air more
strongly than before, and bore it strongly
away; and before it well knew how all
this had happened, it found itself in a
great garden, where the elder trees smelt
sweet, and bent their long green branches
down to the canal that wound through
the region. Oh, here it was so beautiful,
such a gladness of spring! and from the
thicket came three glorious white swans;
they rustled their wings, and swam lightly
on the water. The Duckling knew the
splendid creatures, and felt oppressed by
a peculiar sadness.</p>

<p>"I will fly away to them, to the royal
birds! and they will kill me, because I,
that am so ugly, dare to approach them.
But it is of no consequence! Better to
be killed by <i>them</i> than to be pursued by
ducks, and beaten by fowls, and pushed
about by the girl who takes care of the
poultry-yard, and to suffer hunger in
winter!" And it flew out into the
water, and swam toward the beautiful
swans: these looked at it, and came sailing
down upon it with outspread wings.
"Kill me!" said the poor creature, and
bent its head down upon the water,
expecting nothing but death. But what
was this that it saw in the clear water?
It beheld its own image&mdash;and, lo! it was
no longer a clumsy dark-gray bird, ugly
and hateful to look at, but&mdash;a swan.</p>

<p>It matters nothing if one was born in
a duck-yard, if one has only lain in a
swan's egg.</p>

<p>It felt quite glad at all the need and
misfortune it had suffered, now it realized
its happiness in all the splendor that surrounded
it. And the great swans swam
round it, and stroked it with their beaks.</p>

<p>Into the garden came little children,
who threw bread and corn into the water;
the youngest cried, "There is a new one!"
and the other children shouted joyously,
"Yes, a new one has arrived!" And
they clapped their hands and danced
about, and ran to their father and mother;
and bread and cake were thrown into the
water; and they all said, "The new one is
the most beautiful of all! so young and
handsome!" and the old swans bowed
their heads before him.</p>

<p>Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid
his head under his wing, for he did not
know what to do; he was so happy, and
yet not at all proud. He thought how
he had been persecuted and despised; and
now he heard them saying that he was
the most beautiful of all the birds. Even
the elder tree bent its branches straight
down into the water before him, and the
sun shone warm and mild. Then his
wings rustled, he lifted his slender neck,
and cried rejoicingly from the depths of
his heart:</p>

<p>"I never dreamed of so much happiness
when I was still the Ugly Duckling!"</p>

<div class="hang1">One of the really successful modern attempts
at telling new fairy stories was <i>Granny's
Wonderful Chair</i> (1857) by the blind
poet Frances Browne (1816-1887). In
spite of the obstacles due to blindness,
poverty, and ill-health, she succeeded in
educating herself, and after achieving some
fame as a poet left her mountain village<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
in county Donegal, Ireland, to make a
literary career in Edinburgh and London.
She published many volumes of poems,
novels, and children's books. Only one
of these is now much read or remembered,
but it has taken a firm place in the affections
of children. In <i>Granny's Wonderful Chair</i>
there are seven stories, set in an
interesting framework which tells of the
adventures of the little girl Snowflower and
her chair at the court of King Winwealth.
This chair had magic power to transport
Snowflower wherever she wished to go, like
the magic carpet in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.
When she laid down her head and said,
"Chair of my grandmother, tell me a story,"
a clear voice from under the cushion would
at once begin to speak. Besides the story
that follows, two of the most satisfactory
in the collection are "The Greedy Shepherd"
and "The Story of Merrymind." Perhaps
one of the secrets of their charm is in the
power of visualization which the author
possessed. The pictures are all clear and
definite, yet touched with the glamor of
fairyland.</div>


<h4><br />THE STORY OF FAIRYFOOT</h4>

<div class='center'>FRANCES BROWNE</div>

<p>Once upon a time there stood far away
in the west country a town called Stumpinghame.
It contained seven windmills,
a royal palace, a market place, and a
prison, with every other convenience
befitting the capital of a kingdom. A
capital city was Stumpinghame, and its
inhabitants thought it the only one in
the world. It stood in the midst of a
great plain, which for three leagues round
its walls was covered with corn, flax, and
orchards. Beyond that lay a great
circle of pasture land, seven leagues in
breadth, and it was bounded on all sides
by a forest so thick and old that no man
in Stumpinghame knew its extent; and
the opinion of the learned was that it
reached to the end of the world.</p>

<p>There were strong reasons for this
opinion. First, that forest was known
to be inhabited time out of mind by the
fairies, and no hunter cared to go beyond
its border&mdash;so all the west country
believed it to be solidly full of old trees
to the heart. Secondly, the people of
Stumpinghame were no travelers&mdash;man,
woman, and child had feet so large and
heavy that it was by no means convenient
to carry them far. Whether it
was the nature of the place or the people,
I cannot tell, but great feet had been the
fashion there time immemorial, and the
higher the family the larger were they.
It was, therefore, the aim of everybody
above the degree of shepherds, and such-like
rustics, to swell out and enlarge
their feet by way of gentility; and so
successful were they in these undertakings
that, on a pinch, respectable people's
slippers would have served for panniers.</p>

<p>Stumpinghame had a king of its own,
and his name was Stiffstep; his family
was very ancient and large-footed. His
subjects called him Lord of the World,
and he made a speech to them every
year concerning the grandeur of his
mighty empire. His queen, Hammerheel,
was the greatest beauty in Stumpinghame.
Her majesty's shoe was not
much less than a fishing-boat; their six
children promised to be quite as handsome,
and all went well with them till the
birth of their seventh son.</p>

<p>For a long time nobody about the
palace could understand what was the
matter&mdash;the ladies-in-waiting looked so
astonished, and the king so vexed; but
at last it was whispered through the city
that the queen's seventh child had been
born with such miserably small feet that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
they resembled nothing ever seen or heard
of in Stumpinghame, except the feet of
the fairies.</p>

<p>The chronicles furnished no example of
such an affliction ever before happening
in the royal family. The common people
thought it portended some great calamity
to the city; the learn&egrave;d men began to
write books about it; and all the relations
of the king and queen assembled at the
palace to mourn with them over their
singular misfortune. The whole court
and most of the citizens helped in this
mourning, but when it had lasted seven
days they all found out it was of no use.
So the relations went to their homes, and
the people took to their work. If the
learn&egrave;d men's books were written, nobody
ever read them; and to cheer up the
queen's spirits, the young prince was sent
privately out to the pasture lands, to be
nursed among the shepherds.</p>

<p>The chief man there was called
Fleecefold, and his wife's name was
Rough Ruddy. They lived in a snug
cottage with their son Blackthorn and
their daughter Brownberry, and were
thought great people, because they kept
the king's sheep. Moreover, Fleecefold's
family were known to be ancient; and
Rough Ruddy boasted that she had the
largest feet in all the pastures. The
shepherds held them in high respect, and
it grew still higher when the news spread
that the king's seventh son had been sent
to their cottage. People came from all
quarters to see the young prince, and
great were the lamentations over his
misfortune in having such small feet.</p>

<p>The king and queen had given him
fourteen names, beginning with Augustus&mdash;such
being the fashion in that
royal family; but the honest country
people could not remember so many;
besides, his feet were the most remarkable
thing about the child, so with one
accord they called him Fairyfoot. At
first it was feared this might be high
treason, but when no notice was taken
by the king or his ministers, the shepherds
concluded it was no harm, and the
boy never had another name throughout
the pastures. At court it was not
thought polite to speak of him at all.
They did not keep his birthday, and
he was never sent for at Christmas,
because the queen and her ladies could
not bear the sight. Once a year the
undermost scullion was sent to see how
he did, with a bundle of his next brother's
cast-off clothes; and, as the king grew
old and cross, it was said he had thoughts
of disowning him.</p>

<p>So Fairyfoot grew in Fleecefold's cottage.
Perhaps the country air made
him fair and rosy&mdash;for all agreed that
he would have been a handsome boy
but for his small feet, with which nevertheless
he learned to walk, and in time
to run and to jump, thereby amazing
everybody, for such doings were not
known among the children of Stumpinghame.
The news of court, however,
traveled to the shepherds, and Fairyfoot
was despised among them. The
old people thought him unlucky; the
children refused to play with him.
Fleecefold was ashamed to have him in
his cottage, but he durst not disobey
the king's orders. Moreover, Blackthorn
wore most of the clothes brought by the
scullion. At last, Rough Ruddy found
out that the sight of such horrid jumping
would make her children vulgar; and,
as soon as he was old enough, she sent
Fairyfoot every day to watch some sickly
sheep that grazed on a wild, weedy
pasture, hard by the forest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Fairyfoot was often lonely and
sorrowful; many a time he wished his
feet would grow larger, or that people
wouldn't notice them so much; and all
the comfort he had was running and
jumping by himself in the wild pasture,
and thinking that none of the shepherds'
children could do the like, for all their
pride of their great feet.</p>

<p>Tired of this sport, he was lying in
the shadow of a mossy rock one warm
summer's noon, with the sheep feeding
around, when a robin, pursued by a
great hawk, flew into the old velvet
cap which lay on the ground beside him.
Fairyfoot covered it up, and the hawk,
frightened by his shout, flew away.</p>

<p>"Now you may go, poor robin!" he
said, opening the cap: but instead of
the bird, out sprang a little man dressed
in russet-brown, and looking as if he
were an hundred years old. Fairyfoot
could not speak for astonishment, but
the little man said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you for your shelter, and be
sure I will do as much for you. Call on
me if you are ever in trouble; my name
is Robin Goodfellow"; and darting off,
he was out of sight in an instant. For
days the boy wondered who that little
man could be, but he told nobody, for
the little man's feet were as small as
his own, and it was clear he would be
no favorite in Stumpinghame. Fairyfoot
kept the story to himself, and at
last midsummer came. That evening
was a feast among the shepherds. There
were bonfires on the hills, and fun in
the villages. But Fairyfoot sat alone
beside his sheepfold, for the children of
his village had refused to let him dance
with them about the bonfire, and he had
gone there to bewail the size of his feet,
which came between him and so many
good things. Fairyfoot had never felt so
lonely in all his life, and remembering the
little man, he plucked up spirit, and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ho! Robin Goodfellow!"</p>

<p>"Here I am," said a shrill voice at his
elbow; and there stood the little man
himself.</p>

<p>"I am very lonely, and no one will
play with me, because my feet are not
large enough," said Fairyfoot.</p>

<p>"Come then and play with us," said
the little man. "We lead the merriest
lives in the world, and care for nobody's
feet; but all companies have their own
manners, and there are two things you
must mind among us: first, do as you
see the rest doing; and secondly, never
speak of anything you may hear or see,
for we and the people of this country
have had no friendship ever since large
feet came in fashion."</p>

<p>"I will do that, and anything more
you like," said Fairyfoot; and the little
man, taking his hand, led him over the
pasture into the forest and along a
mossy path among old trees wreathed
with ivy (he never knew how far), till
they heard the sound of music and came
upon a meadow where the moon shone
as bright as day, and all the flowers of
the year&mdash;snowdrops, violets, primroses,
and cowslips&mdash;bloomed together in the
thick grass. There were a crowd of
little men and women, some clad in
russet color, but far more in green, dancing
round a little well as clear as crystal.
And under great rose-trees which grew
here and there in the meadow, companies
were sitting round low tables
covered with cups of milk, dishes of
honey, and carved wooden flagons filled
with clear red wine. The little man led
Fairyfoot up to the nearest table, handed
him one of the flagons, and said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Drink to the good company."</p>

<p>Wine was not very common among
the shepherds of Stumpinghame, and the
boy had never tasted such drink as that
before; for scarcely had it gone down
when he forgot all his troubles&mdash;how
Blackthorn and Brownberry wore his
clothes, how Rough Ruddy sent him to
keep the sickly sheep, and the children
would not dance with him: in short, he
forgot the whole misfortune of his feet,
and it seemed to his mind that he was a
king's son, and all was well with him.
All the little people about the well cried&mdash;"Welcome!
welcome!" and every one
said&mdash;"Come and dance with me!" So
Fairyfoot was as happy as a prince, and
drank milk and ate honey till the moon
was low in the sky, and then the little
man took him by the hand, and never
stopped nor stayed till he was at his
own bed of straw in the cottage corner.</p>

<p>Next morning Fairyfoot was not tired
for all his dancing. Nobody in the cottage
had missed him, and he went out
with the sheep as usual; but every night
all that summer, when the shepherds were
safe in bed, the little man came and took
him away to dance in the forest. Now he
did not care to play with the shepherds'
children, nor grieve that his father and
mother had forgotten him, but watched
the sheep all day, singing to himself or
plaiting rushes; and when the sun went
down, Fairyfoot's heart rejoiced at the
thought of meeting that merry company.</p>

<p>The wonder was that he was never
tired nor sleepy, as people are apt to
be who dance all night; but before the
summer was ended Fairyfoot found out
the reason. One night, when the moon
was full, and the last of the ripe corn
rustling in the fields, Robin Goodfellow
came for him as usual, and away they
went to the flowery green. The fun
there was high, and Robin was in haste.
So he only pointed to the carved cup
from which Fairyfoot every night drank
the clear red wine.</p>

<p>"I am not thirsty, and there is no use
losing time," thought the boy to himself,
and he joined the dance; but never in
all his life did Fairyfoot find such hard
work as to keep pace with the company.
Their feet seemed to move like lightning,
the swallows did not fly so fast or turn
so quickly. Fairyfoot did his best, for
he never gave in easily, but at length,
his breath and strength being spent,
the boy was glad to steal away and sit
down behind a mossy oak, where his
eyes closed for very weariness. When
he awoke the dance was nearly over, but
two little ladies clad in green talked close
beside him.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful boy!" said one of
them. "He is worthy to be a king's son.
Only see what handsome feet he has!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other, with a laugh,
that sounded spiteful; "they are just
like the feet Princess Maybloom had
before she washed them in the Growing
Well. Her father has sent far and wide
throughout the whole country searching
for a doctor to make them small again,
but nothing in this world can do it
except the water of the Fair Fountain,
and none but I and the nightingales
know where it is."</p>

<p>"One would not care to let the like be
known," said the first little lady: "there
would come such crowds of these great
coarse creatures of mankind, nobody
would have peace for leagues round.
But you will surely send word to the
sweet princess!&mdash;she was so kind to
our birds and butterflies, and danced so
like one of ourselves!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not I, indeed!" said the spiteful
fairy. "Her old skinflint of a father
cut down the cedar which I loved best
in the whole forest, and made a chest
of it to hold his money in; besides, I
never liked the princess&mdash;everybody
praised her so. But come, we shall be
too late for the last dance."</p>

<p>When they were gone, Fairyfoot could
sleep no more with astonishment. He
did not wonder at the fairies admiring
his feet, because their own were much
the same; but it amazed him that
Princess Maybloom's father should be
troubled at hers growing large. Moreover,
he wished to see that same princess
and her country, since there were
really other places in the world than
Stumpinghame.</p>

<p>When Robin Goodfellow came to take
him home as usual he durst not let him
know that he had overheard anything;
but never was the boy so unwilling to
get up as on that morning, and all day
he was so weary that in the afternoon
Fairyfoot fell asleep, with his head on
a clump of rushes. It was seldom that
any one thought of looking after him
and the sickly sheep; but it so happened
that towards evening the old shepherd,
Fleecefold, thought he would see how
things went on in the pastures. The
shepherd had a bad temper and a thick
staff, and no sooner did he catch sight
of Fairyfoot sleeping, and his flock
straying away, than shouting all the
ill names he could remember, in a voice
which woke up the boy, he ran after
him as fast as his great feet would allow;
while Fairyfoot, seeing no other shelter
from his fury, fled into the forest, and
never stopped nor stayed till he reached
the banks of a little stream.</p>

<p>Thinking it might lead him to the
fairies' dancing-ground, he followed that
stream for many an hour, but it wound
away into the heart of the forest, flowing
through dells, falling over mossy rocks,
and at last leading Fairyfoot, when he
was tired and the night had fallen, to a
grove of great rose-trees, with the moon
shining on it as bright as day, and
thousands of nightingales singing in the
branches. In the midst of that grove
was a clear spring, bordered with banks
of lilies, and Fairyfoot sat down by it to
rest himself and listen. The singing was
so sweet he could have listened for ever,
but as he sat the nightingales left off their
songs, and began to talk together in the
silence of the night.</p>

<p>"What boy is that," said one on a
branch above him, "who sits so lonely
by the Fair Fountain? He cannot have
come from Stumpinghame with such
small and handsome feet."</p>

<p>"No, I'll warrant you," said another,
"he has come from the west country.
How in the world did he find the way?"</p>

<p>"How simple you are!" said a third
nightingale. "What had he to do but
follow the ground-ivy which grows over
height and hollow, bank and bush, from
the lowest gate of the king's kitchen
garden to the root of this rose-tree? He
looks a wise boy, and I hope he will
keep the secret, or we shall have all the
west country here, dabbling in our
fountain, and leaving us no rest to either
talk or sing."</p>

<p>Fairyfoot sat in great astonishment at
this discourse, but by and by, when the
talk ceased and the songs began, he
thought it might be as well for him to
follow the ground-ivy, and see the
Princess Maybloom, not to speak of
getting rid of Rough Ruddy, the sickly
sheep, and the crusty old shepherd. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
was a long journey; but he went on,
eating wild berries by day, sleeping in the
hollows of old trees by night, and never
losing sight of the ground-ivy, which led
him over height and hollow, bank and
bush, out of the forest, and along a noble
high road, with fields and villages on
every side, to a great city, and a low old-fashioned
gate of the king's kitchen-garden,
which was thought too mean for
the scullions, and had not been opened
for seven years.</p>

<p>There was no use knocking&mdash;the gate
was overgrown with tall weeds and moss;
so, being an active boy, he climbed over,
and walked through the garden, till a
white fawn came frisking by, and he
heard a soft voice saying sorrowfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come back, come back, my fawn!
I cannot run and play with you now, my
feet have grown so heavy"; and looking
round he saw the loveliest young princess
in the world, dressed in snow-white, and
wearing a wreath of roses on her golden
hair; but walking slowly, as the great
people did in Stumpinghame, for her feet
were as large as the best of them.</p>

<p>After her came six young ladies, dressed
in white and walking slowly, for they
could not go before the princess; but
Fairyfoot was amazed to see that their
feet were as small as his own. At once
he guessed that this must be the Princess
Maybloom, and made her an humble
bow, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Royal princess, I have heard of your
trouble because your feet have grown
large; in my country that's all the
fashion. For seven years past I have
been wondering what would make mine
grow, to no purpose; but I know of a
certain fountain that will make yours
smaller and finer than ever they were,
if the king, your father, gives you leave
to come with me, accompanied by two of
your maids that are the least given to
talking, and the most prudent officer in
all his household; for it would grievously
offend the fairies and the nightingales to
make that fountain known."</p>

<p>When the princess heard that, she
danced for joy in spite of her large feet,
and she and her six maids brought
Fairyfoot before the king and queen,
where they sat in their palace hall, with
all the courtiers paying their morning
compliments. The lords were very much
astonished to see a ragged, bare-footed
boy brought in among them, and the
ladies thought Princess Maybloom must
have gone mad; but Fairyfoot, making an
humble reverence, told his message to
the king and queen, and offered to set
out with the princess that very day. At
first the king would not believe that
there could be any use in his offer, because
so many great physicians had
failed to give any relief. The courtiers
laughed Fairyfoot to scorn, the pages
wanted to turn him out for an impudent
impostor, and the prime minister said
he ought to be put to death for high
treason.</p>

<p>Fairyfoot wished himself safe in the
forest again, or even keeping the sickly
sheep; but the queen, being a prudent
woman, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I pray your majesty to notice what
fine feet this boy has. There may be
some truth in his story. For the sake
of our only daughter, I will choose two
maids who talk the least of all our train,
and my chamberlain, who is the most
discreet officer in our household. Let
them go with the princess; who knows
but our sorrow may be lessened?"</p>

<p>After some persuasion the king consented,
though all his councillors advised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the contrary. So the two silent maids,
the discreet chamberlain, and her fawn,
which would not stay behind, were sent
with Princess Maybloom, and they all
set out after dinner. Fairyfoot had hard
work guiding them along the track of
the ground-ivy. The maids and the
chamberlain did not like the brambles
and rough roots of the forest&mdash;they
thought it hard to eat berries and sleep
in hollow trees; but the princess went on
with good courage, and at last they
reached the grove of rose-trees, and the
spring bordered with lilies.</p>

<p>The chamberlain washed&mdash;and though
his hair had been grey, and his face
wrinkled, the young courtiers envied his
beauty for years after. The maids
washed&mdash;and from that day they were
esteemed the fairest in all the palace.
Lastly, the princess washed also&mdash;it
could make her no fairer, but the moment
her feet touched the water they grew
less, and when she had washed and dried
them three times, they were as small and
finely-shaped as Fairyfoot's own. There
was great joy among them, but the boy
said sorrowfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! if there had been a well in the
world to make my feet large, my father
and mother would not have cast me off,
nor sent me to live among the shepherds."</p>

<p>"Cheer up your heart," said the
Princess Maybloom; "if you want large
feet, there is a well in this forest that will
do it. Last summer time I came with
my father and his foresters to see a great
cedar cut down, of which he meant to
make a money chest. While they were
busy with the cedar, I saw a bramble
branch covered with berries. Some were
ripe and some were green, but it was the
longest bramble that ever grew; for the
sake of the berries, I went on and on to
its root, which grew hard by a muddy-looking
well, with banks of dark green
moss, in the deepest part of the forest.
The day was warm and dry and my feet
were sore with the rough ground, so I
took off my scarlet shoes and washed my
feet in the well; but as I washed they
grew larger every minute, and nothing
could ever make them less again. I
have seen the bramble this day; it is not
far off, and as you have shown me the
Fair Fountain, I will show you the Growing
Well."</p>

<p>Up rose Fairyfoot and Princess Maybloom,
and went together till they found
the bramble, and came to where its root
grew, hard by the muddy-looking well,
with banks of dark green moss in the
deepest dell of the forest. Fairyfoot sat
down to wash, but at that minute he
heard a sound of music, and knew it
was the fairies going to their dancing
ground.</p>

<p>"If my feet grow large," said the boy
to himself, "how shall I dance with
them?" So, rising quickly, he took the
Princess Maybloom by the hand. The
fawn followed them; the maids and the
chamberlain followed it, and all followed
the music through the forest. At last
they came to the flowery green. Robin
Goodfellow welcomed the company for
Fairyfoot's sake, and gave every one a
drink of the fairies' wine. So they danced
there from sunset till the grey morning,
and nobody was tired; but before the lark
sang, Robin Goodfellow took them all
safe home, as he used to take Fairyfoot.</p>

<p>There was great joy that day in the
palace because Princess Maybloom's feet
were made small again. The king gave
Fairyfoot all manner of fine clothes and
rich jewels; and when they heard his
wonderful story, he and the queen asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
him to live with them and be their son.
In process of time Fairyfoot and Princess
Maybloom were married, and still live
happily. When they go to visit at
Stumpinghame, they always wash their
feet in the Growing Well, lest the royal
family might think them a disgrace, but
when they come back, they make haste
to the Fair Fountain; and the fairies and
the nightingales are great friends to
them, as well as the maids and the
chamberlain, because they have told
nobody about it, and there is peace and
quiet yet in the grove of rose-trees.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_200" id="Note_200">200</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The ill-fated Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) was
born in Ireland, was educated at Oxford,
came into great notoriety as the reputed
leader of the "aesthetic movement," was
prominent in the London literary world
from 1885 to 1895, fell under the obloquy
of most of his countrymen, and died in
distressing circumstances in Paris. In
addition to some remarkable plays, poems,
and prose books, he wrote a number of
unusual stories especially fascinating to
children, which were collected under the
title <i>The Happy Prince, and Other Tales</i>.
These stories were at once recognized as
classic in quality. While they contain
much implied criticism of certain features
of modern civilization, the whole tone is
so idealistic and the workmanship so fine
that they convey no strong note of bitterness
to the child. "The Happy Prince"
suggests that Wilde saw on the one hand
"the white faces of starving children looking
out listlessly at the black streets";
while on the other hand he saw the Pyramids,
marble angels sculptured on the
cathedral tower, and the gold-covered
statue of the Prince of the Palace of the
Care-Free. Wilde also suggests a remedy
for the starvation and wretchedness that
exist, especially among children, in most
cities where great wealth is displayed. The
important thing in presenting this story
to children is to get the full sympathetic
response due to the sacrifice made by the
Happy Prince and the little swallow. So
much of the effect depends upon the wonderful
beauty of the language that teachers will,
as a rule, get better results from reading or
reciting than from any kind of oral paraphrase.
Another story in this same volume
widely and successfully used by teachers
is the one called "The Selfish Giant."</div>


<h4><br />THE HAPPY PRINCE</h4>

<div class='center'>OSCAR WILDE</div>

<p>High above the city, on a tall column,
stood the statue of the Happy Prince.
He was gilded all over with thin leaves
of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright
sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on
his sword-hilt.</p>

<p>He was very much admired indeed.
"He is as beautiful as a weathercock,"
remarked one of the Town Councillors
who wished to gain a reputation for having
artistic tastes; "only not quite so
useful," he added, fearing lest people
should think him unpractical, which he
really was not.</p>

<p>"Why can't you be like the Happy
Prince?" asked a sensible mother of her
little boy who was crying for the moon.
"The Happy Prince never dreams of
crying for anything."</p>

<p>"I am glad there is some one in the
world who is quite happy," muttered a
disappointed man as he gazed at the
wonderful statue.</p>

<p>"He looks just like an angel," said the
Charity Children as they came out of the
cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks
and their clean white pinafores.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" said the Mathematical
Master; "you have never seen
one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! but we have, in our dreams,"
answered the children; and the Mathematical
Master frowned and looked very
severe, for he did not approve of children
dreaming.</p>

<p>One night there flew over the city a
Little Swallow. His friends had gone
away to Egypt six weeks before, but he
had stayed behind, for he was in love with
the most beautiful Reed. He had met
her early in the spring as he was flying
down the river after a big yellow moth,
and had been so attracted by her slender
waist that he had stopped to talk to her.</p>

<p>"Shall I love you?" said the Swallow,
who liked to come to the point at once,
and the Reed made him a low bow. So
he flew round and round her, touching
the water with his wings, and making
silver ripples. This was his courtship,
and it lasted all through the summer.</p>

<p>"It is a ridiculous attachment," twittered
the other Swallows; "she has no
money, and far too many relations"; and
indeed the river was quite full of Reeds.
Then when the autumn came they all
flew away.</p>

<p>After they had gone he felt lonely, and
began to tire of his lady-love. "She has
no conversation," he said, "and I am
afraid that she is a coquette, for she is
always flirting with the wind." And
certainly, whenever the wind blew, the
Reed made the most graceful curtseys.
"I admit that she is domestic," he continued,
"but I love traveling, and my
wife, consequently, should love traveling
also."</p>

<p>"Will you come away with me?" he
said finally to her; but the Reed shook her
head, she was so attached to her home.</p>

<p>"You have been trifling with me," he
cried. "I am off to the Pyramids.
Good-bye!" and he flew away.</p>

<p>All day long he flew, and at night-time
he arrived at the city. "Where shall I
put up?" he said; "I hope the town has
made preparations."</p>

<p>Then he saw the statue on the tall
column.</p>

<p>"I will put up there," he cried; "it is a
fine position, with plenty of fresh air."
So he alighted just between the feet of
the Happy Prince.</p>

<p>"I have a golden bedroom," he said
softly to himself as he looked round, and
he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he
was putting his head under his wing a
large drop of water fell on him. "What
a curious thing!" he cried; "there is not
a single cloud in the sky, the stars are
quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.
The climate in the north of Europe
is really dreadful. The Reed used to like
the rain, but that was merely her selfishness."</p>

<p>Then another drop fell.</p>

<p>"What is the use of a statue if it cannot
keep the rain off?" he said; "I must
look for a good chimney-pot," and he
determined to fly away.</p>

<p>But before he had opened his wings, a
third drop fell, and he looked up, and
saw&mdash;Ah! what did he see?</p>

<p>The eyes of the Happy Prince were
filled with tears, and tears were running
down his golden cheeks. His face was
so beautiful in the moonlight that the
little Swallow was filled with pity.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he said.</p>

<p>"I am the Happy Prince."</p>

<p>"Why are you weeping then?" asked the
Swallow; "you have quite drenched me."</p>

<p>"When I was alive and had a human
heart," answered the statue, "I did not
know what tears were, for I lived in the
Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not
allowed to enter. In the daytime I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
played with my companions in the garden,
and in the evening I led the dance
in the Great Hall. Round the garden
ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared
to ask what lay beyond it, everything
about me was so beautiful. My courtiers
called me the Happy Prince, and
happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness.
So I lived, and so I died. And
now that I am dead they have set me up
here so high that I can see all the ugliness
and all the misery of my city, and though
my heart is made of lead yet I cannot
choose but weep."</p>

<p>"What! is he not solid gold?" said the
Swallow to himself. He was too polite
to make any personal remarks out loud.</p>

<p>"Far away," continued the statue in a
low musical voice, "far away in a little
street there is a poor house. One of the
windows is open, and through it I can
see a woman seated at a table. Her face
is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red
hands, all pricked by the needle, for she
is a seamstress. She is embroidering
passion-flowers on a satin gown for the
loveliest of the Queen's maids-of-honor to
wear at the next Court-ball. In a bed
in the corner of the room her little boy
is lying ill. He has a fever, and is asking
for oranges. His mother has nothing to
give him but river water, so he is crying.
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,
will you not take her the ruby out of
my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to
this pedestal and I cannot move."</p>

<p>"I am waited for in Egypt," said the
Swallow. "My friends are flying up and
down the Nile, and talking to the large
lotus-flowers. Soon they will go to sleep
in the tomb of the great King. The King
is there himself in his painted coffin. He
is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed
with spices. Round his neck is a chain
of pale green jade, and his hands are like
withered leaves."</p>

<p>"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"
said the Prince, "will you not stay with
me for one night, and be my messenger?
The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so
sad."</p>

<p>"I don't think I like boys," answered
the Swallow. "Last summer, when I
was staying on the river, there were two
rude boys, the miller's sons, who were
always throwing stones at me. They
never hit me, of course; we swallows fly
far too well for that, and besides, I come
of a family famous for its agility; but still,
it was a mark of disrespect."</p>

<p>But the Happy Prince looked so sad
that the little Swallow was sorry. "It is
very cold here," he said; "but I will stay
with you for one night, and be your
messenger."</p>

<p>"Thank you, little Swallow," said the
Prince.</p>

<p>So the Swallow picked out the great
ruby from the Prince's sword, and flew
away with it in his beak over the roofs of
the town.</p>

<p>He passed by the cathedral tower,
where the white marble angels were sculptured.
He passed by the palace and
heard the sound of dancing. A beautiful
girl came out on the balcony with her
lover. "How wonderful the stars are,"
he said to her, "and how wonderful is
the power of love!"</p>

<p>"I hope my dress will be ready in time
for the State-ball," she answered; "I
have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered
on it; but the seamstresses are
so lazy."</p>

<p>He passed over the river, and saw the
lanterns hanging to the masts of the
ships. He passed over the Ghetto, and
saw the old Jews bargaining with each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
other, and weighing out money in copper
scales. At last he came to the poor
house and looked in. The boy was tossing
feverishly on his bed, and the mother
had fallen asleep, she was so tired. In
he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the
table beside the woman's thimble. Then
he flew gently round the bed, fanning the
boy's forehead with his wings. "How
cool I feel," said the boy. "I must be
getting better"; and he sank into a
delicious slumber.</p>

<p>Then the Swallow flew back to the
Happy Prince, and told him what he had
done. "It is curious," he remarked,
"but I feel quite warm now, although it
is so cold."</p>

<p>"That is because you have done a
good action," said the Prince. And the
little Swallow began to think, and then
he fell asleep. Thinking always made
him sleepy.</p>

<p>When day broke he flew down to the
river and had a bath. "What a remarkable
phenomenon," said the Professor of
Ornithology as he was passing over the
bridge. "A swallow in winter!" And
he wrote a long letter about it to the
local newspaper. Every one quoted it,
it was full of so many words that they
could not understand.</p>

<p>"To-night I go to Egypt," said the
Swallow, and he was in high spirits at
the prospect. He visited all the public
monuments, and sat a long time on top of
the church steeple. Wherever he went
the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each
other, "What a distinguished stranger!"
so he enjoyed himself very much.</p>

<p>When the moon rose he flew back to
the Happy Prince. "Have you any commissions
for Egypt?" he cried; "I am
just starting."</p>

<p>"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"
said the Prince, "will you not stay with
me one night longer?"</p>

<p>"I am waited for in Egypt," answered
the Swallow. "To-morrow my friends
will fly up to the Second Cataract. The
river-horse couches there among the bulrushes,
and on a great granite throne sits
the God Memnon. All night long he
watches the stars, and when the morning
star shines he utters one cry of joy, and
then he is silent. At noon the yellow
lions come down to the water's edge to
drink. They have eyes like green beryls,
and their roar is louder than the roar of
the cataract."</p>

<p>"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"
said the Prince, "far away across the city
I see a young man in a garret. He is
leaning over a desk covered with papers,
and in a tumbler by his side there is a
bunch of withered violets. His hair is
brown and crisp, and his lips are red as
a pomegranate, and he has large and
dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a
play for the Director of the Theatre, but
he is too cold to write any more. There
is no fire in the grate, and hunger has
made him faint."</p>

<p>"I will wait with you one night longer,"
said the Swallow, who really had a good
heart. "Shall I take him another ruby?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I have no ruby now," said the
Prince; "my eyes are all that I have left.
They are made of rare sapphires, which
were brought out of India a thousand
years ago. Pluck out one of them and
take it to him. He will sell it to the
jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and
finish his play."</p>

<p>"Dear Prince," said the Swallow, "I
cannot do that"; and he began to weep.</p>

<p>"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"
said the Prince, "do as I command you."</p>

<p>So the Swallow plucked out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Prince's eye, and flew away to the student's
garret. It was easy enough to get
in, as there was a hole in the roof.
Through this he darted, and came into
the room. The young man had his head
buried in his hands, so he did not hear
the flutter of the bird's wings, and when
he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire
lying on the withered violets.</p>

<p>"I am beginning to be appreciated,"
he cried; "this is from some great admirer.
Now I can finish my play," and he looked
quite happy.</p>

<p>The next day the Swallow flew down
to the harbor. He sat on the mast of
a large vessel and watched the sailors
hauling big chests out of the hold with
ropes. "Heave a-hoy!" they shouted as
each chest came up. "I am going to
Egypt!" cried the Swallow, but nobody
minded, and when the moon rose he flew
back to the Happy Prince.</p>

<p>"I am come to bid you good-bye," he
cried.</p>

<p>"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"
said the Prince, "will you not stay with
me one night longer?"</p>

<p>"It is winter," answered the Swallow,
"and the chill snow will soon be here.
In Egypt the sun is warm on the green
palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the
mud and look lazily about them. My
companions are building a nest in the
Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and
white doves are watching them, and
cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I
must leave you, but I will never forget
you, and next spring I will bring you back
two beautiful jewels in place of those you
have given away. The ruby shall be
redder than a red rose, and the sapphire
shall be as blue as the great sea."</p>

<p>"In the square below," said the Happy
Prince, "there stands a little match-girl.
She has let her matches fall in the gutter,
and they are all spoiled. Her father will
beat her if she does not bring home some
money, and she is crying. She has no
shoes or stockings, and her little head is
bare. Pluck out my other eye, and give it
to her, and her father will not beat her."</p>

<p>"I will stay with you one night longer,"
said the Swallow, "but I cannot pluck
out your eye. You would be quite blind
then."</p>

<p>"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,"
said the Prince, "do as I command you."</p>

<p>So he plucked out the Prince's other
eye, and darted down with it. He
swooped past the match-girl, and slipped
the jewel into the palm of her hand.
"What a lovely bit of glass," cried the
little girl; and she ran home, laughing.</p>

<p>Then the Swallow came back to the
Prince. "You are blind now," he said,
"so I will stay with you always."</p>

<p>"No, little Swallow," said the poor
Prince, "you must go away to Egypt."</p>

<p>"I will stay with you always," said
the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's
feet.</p>

<p>All the next day he sat on the Prince's
shoulder, and told him stories of what he
had seen in strange lands. He told him
of the red ibises, who stand in long rows
on the banks of the Nile, and catch goldfish
in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is
as old as the world itself, and lives in the
desert, and knows everything; of the
merchants, who walk slowly by the
side of their camels, and carry amber
beads in their hands; of the King of the
Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as
ebony, and worships a large crystal; of
the great green snake that sleeps in a
palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed
it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies
who sail over a big lake on large flat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
leaves, and are always at war with the
butterflies.</p>

<p>"Dear little Swallow," said the Prince,
"you tell me of marvelous things, but
more marvelous than anything is the
suffering of men and of women. There
is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly
over my city, little Swallow, and tell me
what you see there."</p>

<p>So the Swallow flew over the great
city, and saw the rich making merry in
their beautiful houses, while the beggars
were sitting at the gates. He flew into
dark lanes, and saw the white faces of
starving children looking out listlessly at
the black streets. Under the archway of
a bridge two little boys were lying in one
another's arms to try to keep themselves
warm. "How hungry we are!"
they said. "You must not lie here,"
shouted the Watchman, and they wandered
out into the rain.</p>

<p>Then he flew back and told the Prince
what he had seen.</p>

<p>"I am covered with fine gold," said
the Prince; "you must take it off, leaf
by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living
always think that gold can make them
happy."</p>

<p>Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow
picked off, till the Happy Prince
looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after
leaf of the fine gold he brought to the
poor, and the children's faces grew rosier,
and they laughed and played games in the
street. "We have bread now!" they cried.</p>

<p>Then the snow came, and after the
snow came the frost. The streets looked
as if they were made of silver, they were
so bright and glistening; long icicles like
crystal daggers hung down from the
eaves of the houses, everybody went
about in furs, and the little boys wore
scarlet caps and skated on the ice.</p>

<p>The poor little Swallow grew colder and
colder, but he would not leave the Prince;
he loved him too well. He picked up
crumbs outside the baker's door when the
baker was not looking, and tried to keep
himself warm by flapping his wings.</p>

<p>But at last he knew that he was going
to die. He had just strength to fly up
to the Prince's shoulder once more.
"Good-bye, dear Prince!" he murmured,
"will you let me kiss your hand?"</p>

<p>"I am glad that you are going to Egypt
at last, little Swallow," said the Prince.
"You have stayed too long here; but you
must kiss me on the lips, for I love you."</p>

<p>"It is not to Egypt that I am going,"
said the Swallow. "I am going to the
House of Death. Death is the brother of
Sleep, is he not?"</p>

<p>And he kissed the Happy Prince on the
lips, and fell down dead at his feet.</p>

<p>At that moment a curious crack
sounded inside the statue, as if something
had suddenly broken. The fact is
that the leaden heart had snapped right
in two. It certainly was a dreadfully
hard frost.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the Mayor
was walking in the square below in company
with the Town Councillors. As
they passed the column he looked up at
the statue: "Dear me! how shabby the
Happy Prince looks!" he said.</p>

<p>"How shabby indeed!" cried the Town
Councillors, who always agreed with the
Mayor; and they went up to look at it.</p>

<p>"The ruby has fallen out of his sword,
his eyes are gone, and he is golden no
longer," said the Mayor; "in fact, he is
little better than a beggar!"</p>

<p>"Little better than a beggar," said the
Town Councillors.</p>

<p>"And here is actually a dead bird at
his feet!" continued the Mayor. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
must really issue a proclamation that
birds are not to be allowed to die here."
And the Town Clerk made a note of the
suggestion.</p>

<p>So they pulled down the statue of the
Happy Prince. "As he is no longer
beautiful he is no longer useful," said the
Art Professor at the University.</p>

<p>Then they melted the statue in a furnace,
and the Mayor held a meeting of
the Corporation to decide what was to be
done with the metal. "We must have
another statue, of course," he said, "and
it shall be a statue of myself."</p>

<p>"Of myself," said each of the Town
Councillors, and they quarrelled. When
I last heard of them they were quarreling
still.</p>

<p>"What a strange thing!" said the overseer
of the workmen at the foundry.
"This broken lead heart will not melt in
the furnace. We must throw it away."
So they threw it on a dustheap where the
dead Swallow was also lying.</p>

<p>"Bring me the two most precious
things in the city," said God to one of
His Angels; and the Angel brought Him
the leaden heart and the dead bird.</p>

<p>"You have rightly chosen," said God,
"for in my garden of Paradise this little
bird shall sing for evermore, and in my
city of gold the Happy Prince shall
praise me."</p>

<div class="hang1">Two stories of unusual interest and charm
for children are found in the collection of
eleven by Raymond M. Alden (1873&mdash;),
<i>Why the Chimes Rang</i>. One is the title
story of the volume; the other is "The
Knights of the Silver Shield." The latter
follows by permission of the publishers,
The Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis.
(Copyright, 1906, 1908.) It is of striking
dramatic interest and emphasizes a much-needed
quality of character, the importance
of a loyal performance of the lowlier duties
of life. The salvation of a nation may
depend upon the humble guardian of the
gate quite as much as upon those who are
engaged in the more spectacular struggle
with giants. Mr. Alden is a scholarly
professor of literature in Leland Stanford
Jr. University, and it may interest the
reader to know that he is the son of the
author of the <i>Pansy Books</i>, a type of religious
or Sunday-school fiction widely read
throughout the country by a generation
or two of young people.</div>


<h4><br />THE KNIGHTS OF THE
SILVER SHIELD</h4>

<div class='center'>RAYMOND MACDONALD ALDEN</div>

<p>There was once a splendid castle in a
forest, with great stone walls and a high
gateway, and turrets that rose away
above the tallest trees. The forest was
dark and dangerous, and many cruel
giants lived in it; but in the castle was a
company of knights, who were kept there
by the king of the country, to help travelers
who might be in the forest and to
fight with the giants whenever they could.</p>

<p>Each of these knights wore a beautiful
suit of armor and carried a long spear,
while over his helmet there floated a great
red plume that could be seen a long way
off by any one in distress. But the most
wonderful thing about the knights'
armor was their shields. They were not
like those of other knights, but had been
made by a great magician who had lived
in the castle many years before. They
were made of silver, and sometimes shone
in the sunlight with dazzling brightness;
but at other times the surface of the
shields would be clouded as though by a
mist, and one could not see his face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
reflected there as he could when they
shone brightly.</p>

<p>Now, when each young knight received
his spurs and his armor, a new shield was
also given him from among those that the
magician had made; and when the shield
was new its surface was always cloudy
and dull. But as the knight began to do
service against the giants, or went on
expeditions to help poor travelers in the
forest, his shield grew brighter and
brighter, so that he could see his face
clearly reflected in it. But if he proved
to be a lazy or cowardly knight, and let
the giants get the better of him, or did
not care what became of the travelers,
then the shield grew more and more
cloudy, until the knight became ashamed
to carry it.</p>

<p>But this was not all. When any one
of the knights fought a particularly hard
battle, and won the victory, or when he
went on some hard errand for the lord
of the castle, and was successful, not only
did his silver shield grow brighter, but
when one looked into the center of it he
could see something like a golden star
shining in its very heart. This was the
greatest honor that a knight could
achieve, and the other knights always
spoke of such a one as having "won his
star." It was usually not till he was
pretty old and tried as a soldier that he
could win it. At the time when this
story begins, the lord of the castle himself
was the only one of the knights whose
shield bore the golden star.</p>

<p>There came a time when the worst of
the giants in the forest gathered themselves
together to have a battle against
the knights. They made a camp in a
dark hollow not far from the castle, and
gathered all their best warriors together,
and all the knights made ready to fight
them. The windows of the castle were
closed and barred; the air was full of the
noise of armor being made ready for use;
and the knights were so excited that they
could scarcely rest or eat.</p>

<p>Now there was a young knight in the
castle, named Sir Roland, who was
among those most eager for the battle.
He was a splendid warrior, with eyes that
shone like stars whenever there was anything
to do in the way of knightly deeds.
And although he was still quite young,
his shield had begun to shine enough to
show plainly that he had done bravely
in some of his errands through the forest.
This battle, he thought, would be the
great opportunity of his life. And on the
morning of the day when they were to go
forth to it, and all the knights assembled
in the great hall of the castle to receive
the commands of their leaders, Sir Roland
hoped that he would be put in the most
dangerous place of all, so that he could
show what knightly stuff he was made of.</p>

<p>But when the lord of the castle came
to him, as he went about in full armor
giving his commands, he said: "One
brave knight must stay behind and guard
the gateway of the castle, and it is you,
Sir Roland, being one of the youngest,
whom I have chosen for this."</p>

<p>At these words Sir Roland was so disappointed
that he bit his lip and closed
his helmet over his face so that the other
knights might not see it. For a moment
he felt as if he must reply angrily to the
commander and tell him that it was not
right to leave so sturdy a knight behind
when he was eager to fight. But he
struggled against this feeling and went
quietly to look after his duties at the gate.
The gateway was high and narrow, and
was reached from outside by a high, narrow
bridge that crossed the moat, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
surrounded the castle on every side.
When an enemy approached, the knight
on guard rang a great bell just inside the
gate, and the bridge was drawn up against
the castle wall, so that no one could come
across the moat. So the giants had long
ago given up trying to attack the castle
itself.</p>

<p>To-day the battle was to be in the dark
hollow in the forest, and it was not likely
that there would be anything to do at the
castle gate, except to watch it like a common
doorkeeper. It was not strange
that Sir Roland thought some one else
might have done this.</p>

<p>Presently all the other knights marched
out in their flashing armor, their red
plumes waving over their heads, and their
spears in their hands. The lord of the
castle stopped only to tell Sir Roland to
keep guard over the gate until they had
all returned and to let no one enter.
Then they went into the shadows of the
forest and were soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>Sir Roland stood looking after them
long after they had gone, thinking how
happy he would be if he were on the way
to battle like them. But after a little he
put this out of his mind and tried to
think of pleasanter things. It was a long
time before anything happened, or any
word came from the battle.</p>

<p>At last Sir Roland saw one of the
knights come limping down the path to
the castle, and he went out on the bridge
to meet him. Now this knight was not
a brave one, and he had been frightened
away as soon as he was wounded.</p>

<p>"I have been hurt," he said, "so that
I can not fight any more. But I could
watch the gate for you, if you would like
to go back in my place."</p>

<p>At first Sir Roland's heart leaped with
joy at this, but then he remembered what
the commander had told him on going
away, and he said:</p>

<p>"I should like to go, but a knight
belongs where his commander has put
him. My place is here at the gate, and I
can not open it even for you. Your place
is at the battle."</p>

<p>The knight was ashamed when he heard
this, and he presently turned about and
went into the forest again.</p>

<p>So Sir Roland kept guard silently for
another hour. Then there came an old
beggar woman down the path to the
castle and asked Sir Roland if she might
come in and have some food. He told
her that no one could enter the castle that
day, but that he would send a servant
out to her with food, and that she might
sit and rest as long as she would.</p>

<p>"I have been past the hollow in the
forest where the battle is going on," said
the old woman, while she was waiting for
her food.</p>

<p>"And how do you think it is going?"
asked Sir Roland.</p>

<p>"Badly for the knights, I am afraid,"
said the old woman. "The giants are
fighting as they have never fought before.
I should think you had better go and help
your friends."</p>

<p>"I should like to, indeed," said Sir
Roland. "But I am set to guard the gateway
of the castle and can not leave."</p>

<p>"One fresh knight would make a great
difference when they are all weary with
fighting," said the old woman. "I
should think that, while there are no
enemies about, you would be much more
useful there."</p>

<p>"You may well think so," said Sir
Roland, "and so may I; but it is neither
you nor I that is commander here."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the old woman
then, "that you are one of the kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
knights who like to keep out of fighting.
You are lucky to have so good an excuse
for staying at home." And she laughed
a thin and taunting laugh.</p>

<p>Then Sir Roland was very angry, and
thought that if it were only a man instead
of a woman, he would show him
whether he liked fighting or no. But as
it was a woman, he shut his lips and set
his teeth hard together, and as the servant
came just then with the food he had sent
for, he gave it to the old woman quickly
and shut the gate that she might not talk
to him any more.</p>

<p>It was not very long before he heard
some one calling outside. Sir Roland
opened the gate and saw standing at the
other end of the drawbridge a little old
man in a long black cloak. "Why are
you knocking here?" he said. "The
castle is closed to-day."</p>

<p>"Are you Sir Roland?" said the little
old man.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sir Roland.</p>

<p>"Then you ought not to be staying
here when your commander and his
knights are having so hard a struggle
with the giants, and when you have the
chance to make of yourself the greatest
knight in this kingdom. Listen to me!
I have brought you a magic sword."</p>

<p>As he said this, the old man drew from
under his coat a wonderful sword that
flashed in the sunlight as if it were covered
with diamonds. "This is the sword
of all swords," he said, "and it is for you,
if you will leave your idling here by the
castle gate and carry it to the battle.
Nothing can stand before it. When you
lift it the giants will fall back, your master
will be saved, and you will be crowned
the victorious knight&mdash;the one who will
soon take his commander's place as lord
of the castle."</p>

<p>Now Sir Roland believed that it was
a magician who was speaking to him,
for it certainly appeared to be a magic
sword. It seemed so wonderful that the
sword should be brought to him, that he
reached out his hand as though he would
take it, and the little old man came forward,
as though he would cross the drawbridge
into the castle. But as he did so,
it came to Sir Roland's mind again that
that bridge and the gateway had been intrusted
to him, and he called out "No!"
to the old man, so that he stopped where
he was standing. But he waved the shining
sword in the air again, and said: "It
is for you! Take it, and win the victory!"</p>

<p>Sir Roland was really afraid that if he
looked any longer at the sword or listened
to any more words of the old man, he
would not be able to hold himself within
the castle. For this reason he struck the
great bell at the gateway, which was the
signal for the servants inside to pull in the
chains of the drawbridge, and instantly
they began to pull, and the drawbridge
came up, so that the old man could not
cross it to enter the castle, nor Sir Roland
to go out.</p>

<p>Then, as he looked across the moat,
Sir Roland saw a wonderful thing. The
little old man threw off his black cloak,
and as he did so he began to grow bigger
and bigger, until in a minute more he was
a giant as tall as any in the forest. At
first Sir Roland could scarcely believe
his eyes. Then he realized that this
must be one of their giant enemies, who
had changed himself to a little old man
through some magic power, that he might
make his way into the castle while all the
knights were away. Sir Roland shuddered
to think what might have happened
if he had taken the sword and left the
gate unguarded. The giant shook his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
fist across the moat that lay between
them, and then, knowing that he could
do nothing more, he went angrily back
into the forest.</p>

<p>Sir Roland now resolved not to open
the gate again, and to pay no attention
to any other visitor. But it was not long
before he heard a sound that made him
spring forward in joy. It was the bugle
of the lord of the castle, and there came
sounding after it the bugles of many of
the knights that were with him, pealing
so joyfully that Sir Roland was sure they
were safe and happy. As they came
nearer, he could hear their shouts of victory.
So he gave the signal to let down
the drawbridge again, and went out to
meet them. They were dusty and bloodstained
and weary, but they had won the
battle with the giants; and it had been
such a great victory that there had never
been a happier home-coming.</p>

<p>Sir Roland greeted them all as they
passed in over the bridge, and then,
when he had closed the gate and fastened
it, he followed them into the great hall
of the castle. The lord of the castle took
his place on the highest seat, with the
other knights about him, and Sir Roland
came forward with the key of the gate,
to give his account of what he had done
in the place to which the commander
had appointed him. The lord of the
castle bowed to him as a sign for him to
begin, but just as he opened his mouth
to speak, one of the knights cried out:</p>

<p>"The shield! the shield! Sir Roland's
shield!"</p>

<p>Every one turned and looked at the
shield which Sir Roland carried on his
left arm. He himself could see only the
top of it and did not know what they
could mean. But what they saw was
the golden star of knighthood, shining
brightly from the center of Sir Roland's
shield. There had never been such
amazement in the castle before.</p>

<p>Sir Roland knelt before the lord of the
castle to receive his commands. He
still did not know why every one was
looking at him so excitedly, and wondered
if he had in some way done wrong.</p>

<p>"Speak, Sir Knight," said the commander,
as soon as he could find his
voice after his surprise, "and tell us all
that has happened to-day at the castle.
Have you been attacked? Have any
giants come hither? Did you fight them
alone?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord," said Sir Roland.
"Only one giant has been here, and he
went away silently when he found he
could not enter."</p>

<p>Then he told all that had happened
through the day.</p>

<p>When he had finished, the knights all
looked at one another, but no one spoke
a word. Then they looked again at Sir
Roland's shield, to make sure that their
eyes had not deceived them, and there
the golden star was still shining.</p>

<p>After a little silence the lord of the
castle spoke.</p>

<p>"Men make mistakes," he said, "but
our silver shields are never mistaken.
Sir Roland has fought and won the hardest
battle of all to-day."</p>

<p>Then the others all rose and saluted
Sir Roland, who was the youngest knight
that ever carried the golden star.</p>

<div class="hang1">Jean Ingelow (1820-1897) was an English
poet, novelist, and writer of stories for
children, who lived in the fen district of
Lincolnshire. Her most noted poem deals
with a terrible catastrophe that happened
there more than three centuries ago. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
is called "The High Tide on the Coast of
Lincolnshire." Many reading books for
the third or fourth grade contain her dainty
and melodious "Seven Times One," in
which a little girl expresses the joy and
sense of power felt on reaching a seventh
birthday. Of her children's books, the
favorite is <i>Mopsa the Fairy</i>, which some
one has called a "delightful succession of
breezy impossibilities." Her shorter stories
for children are collected under the title
<i>Stories Told to a Child</i> (two series), from
which "The Prince's Dream" is taken.
It is somewhat old fashioned in method
and style, reminding one of the stories of
the days of Addison and Steele. Its
seriousness is in striking contrast with the
more flippant note in much modern writing
for children, and it is sure to suggest
some questions on the dangers and advantages
of great possessions in their effects
on labor, liberty, and human happiness in
general. However, the moral will take
care of itself, and the attention should rest
on the means used by the old man to teach
the young prince the things he is shut out
from learning by experience. The children
will easily see that it is an anticipation of
the moving-picture method. Some other
good stories in the collection mentioned
are "I Have a Right," "The Fairy Who
Judged Her Neighbors," and "Anselmo."</div>


<h4><br />THE PRINCE'S DREAM</h4>

<div class='center'>JEAN INGELOW</div>

<p>If we may credit the fable, there is a
tower in the midst of a great Asiatic
plain, wherein is confined a prince who
was placed there in his earliest infancy,
with many slaves and attendants, and
all the luxuries that are compatible with
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Whether he was brought there from
some motive of state, whether to conceal
him from enemies, or to deprive him of
rights, has not transpired; but it is certain
that up to the date of this little history he
had never set his foot outside the walls
of that high tower, and that of the vast
world without he knew only the green
plains which surrounded it; the flocks and
the birds of that region were all his
experience of living creatures, and all the
men he saw outside were shepherds.</p>

<p>And yet he was not utterly deprived of
change, for sometimes one of his attendants
would be ordered away, and his place
would be supplied by a new one. This
fresh companion the prince would never
weary of questioning, and letting him
talk of cities, of ships, of forests, of merchandise,
of kings; but though in turns
they all tried to satisfy his curiosity, they
could not succeed in conveying very
distinct notions to his mind; partly because
there was nothing in the tower to
which they could compare the external
world, partly because, having chiefly
lived lives of seclusion and indolence in
Eastern palaces, they knew it only by
hearsay themselves.</p>

<p>At length, one day, a venerable man of
a noble presence was brought to the
tower, with soldiers to guard him and
slaves to attend him. The prince was
glad of his presence, though at first he
seldom opened his lips, and it was manifest
that confinement made him miserable.
With restless feet he would wander
from window to window of the stone
tower, and mount from story to story;
but mount as high as he would there was
still nothing to be seen but the vast
unvarying plain, clothed with scanty
grass, and flooded with the glaring sunshine;
flocks and herds, and shepherds,
moved across it sometimes, but nothing
else, not even a shadow, for there was no
cloud in the sky to cast one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man, however, always treated
the prince with respect, and answered his
questions with a great deal of patience,
till at length he found a pleasure in satisfying
his curiosity, which so much pleased
the young prisoner, that, as a great condescension,
he invited him to come out
on the roof of the tower and drink sherbet
with him in the cool of the evening,
and tell him of the country beyond the
desert, and what seas are like, and mountains,
and towns.</p>

<p>"I have learnt much from my attendants,
and know this world pretty well by
hearsay," said the prince, as they reclined
on the rich carpet which was spread on
the roof.</p>

<p>The old man smiled, but did not
answer; perhaps because he did not care to
undeceive his young companion, perhaps
because so many slaves were present, some
of whom were serving them with fruit,
and others burning rich odors on a little
chafing-dish that stood between them.</p>

<p>"But there are some words to which
I never could attach any particular
meaning," proceeded the prince, as the
slaves began to retire, "and three in particular
that my attendants cannot satisfy
me upon, or are reluctant to do so."</p>

<p>"What words are those, my prince?"
asked the old man. The prince turned on
his elbow to be sure that the last slave had
descended the tower stairs, then replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"O man of much knowledge, the words
are these&mdash;Labor, and Liberty, and
Gold."</p>

<p>"Prince," said the old man, "I do not
wonder that it has been hard to make
thee understand the first, the nature of it,
and the cause why most men are born to
it; as for the second, it would be treason
for thee and me to do more than whisper
it here, and sigh for it when none are
listening; but the third need hardly
puzzle thee, thy hookah is bright with it;
all thy jewels are set in it; gold is inlaid
in the ivory of thy bath; thy cup and thy
dish are of gold, and golden threads are
wrought into thy raiment."</p>

<p>"That is true," replied the prince,
"and if I had not seen and handled this
gold, perhaps I might not find its merits
so hard to understand; but I possess it in
abundance, and it does not feed me, nor
make music for me, nor fan me when the
sun is hot, nor cause me to sleep when I
am weary; therefore when my slaves have
told me how merchants go out and brave
the perilous wind and sea, and live in the
unstable ships, and run risks from shipwreck
and pirates, and when, having
asked them why they have done this,
they have answered, 'For gold,' I have
found it hard to believe them; and when
they have told me how men have lied,
and robbed, and deceived; how they have
murdered one another, and leagued together
to depose kings, to oppress provinces,
and all for gold; then I have said
to myself, either my slaves have combined
to make me believe that which is
not, or this gold must be very different
from the yellow stuff that this coin is
made of, this coin which is of no use
but to have a hole pierced through it and
hang to my girdle, that it may tinkle
when I walk."</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding," said the old man,
"nothing can be done without gold; for
look you, prince, it is better than bread,
and fruit, and music, for it can buy them
all, since men love it, and have agreed to
exchange it for whatever they may need."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked the prince.</p>

<p>"If a man has many loaves he cannot
eat them all," answered the old man;
"therefore he goes to his neighbor and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
says, 'I have bread and thou hast a coin
of gold&mdash;let us change'; so he receives
the gold and goes to another man, saying,
'Thou hast two houses and I have none;
lend me one of thy houses to live in, and
I will give thee my gold'; thus again they
change, and he that has the gold says, 'I
have food enough and goods enough, but
I want a wife, I will go to the merchant
and get a marriage gift for her father, and
for it I will give him this gold.'"</p>

<p>"It is well," said the prince; "but in
time of drought, if there is no bread in a
city, can they make it of gold?"</p>

<p>"Not so," answered the old man, "but
they must send their gold to a city where
there is food, and bring that back instead
of it."</p>

<p>"But if there was a famine all over the
world," asked the prince, "what would
they do then?"</p>

<p>"Why then, and only then," said the
old man, "they must starve, and the gold
would be nought, for it can only be
changed for that which <i>is;</i> it cannot
make that which is not."</p>

<p>"And where do they get gold?" asked
the prince; "is it the precious fruit of some
rare tree, or have they whereby they can
draw it down from the sky at sunset?"</p>

<p>"Some of it," said the old man, "they
dig out of the ground."</p>

<p>Then he told the prince of ancient
rivers running through terrible deserts,
whose sands glitter, with golden grains
and are yellow in the fierce heat of the
sun, and of dreary mines where the Indian
slaves work in gangs tied together, never
seeing the light of day; and lastly (for he
was a man of much knowledge, and had
traveled far), he told him of the valley of
the Sacramento in the New World, and
of those mountains where the people of
Europe send their criminals, and where
now their free men pour forth to gather
gold, and dig for it as hard as if for life;
sitting up by it at night lest any should
take it from them, giving up houses and
country, and wife and children, for the
sake of a few feet of mud, whence they
dig clay that glitters as they wash it; and
how they sift it and rock it as patiently
as if it were their own children in the
cradle, and afterwards carry it in their
bosoms, and forego on account of it
safety and rest.</p>

<p>"But, prince," he proceeded, observing
that the young man was absorbed in his
narrative, "if you would pass your word
to me never to betray me, I would procure
for you a sight of the external
world, and in a trance you should see
those places where gold is dug, and traverse
those regions forbidden to your
mortal footsteps."</p>

<p>Upon this, the prince threw himself at
the old man's feet, and promised heartily
to observe the secrecy required, and
entreated that, for however short time,
he might be suffered to see this wonderful
world.</p>

<p>Then, if we may credit the story, the
old man drew nearer to the chafing-dish
which stood between them, and having
fanned the dying embers in it, cast upon
them a certain powder and some herbs,
from whence as they burnt a peculiar
smoke arose. As their vapors spread, he
desired the prince to draw near and inhale
them, and then (says the fable) when he
should sleep he should find himself, in
his dream, at whatever place he might
desire, with this strange advantage, that
he should see things in their truth and
reality as well as in their outward
shows.</p>

<p>So the prince, not without some fear,
prepared to obey; but first he drank his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
sherbet, and handed over the golden cup
to the old man by way of recompense;
then he reclined beside the chafing-dish
and inhaled the heavy perfume till he
became overpowered with sleep, and sank
down upon the carpet in a dream.</p>

<p>The prince knew not where he was, but
a green country was floating before him,
and he found himself standing in a marshy
valley, where a few wretched cottages
were scattered here and there with no
means of communication. There was a
river, but it had overflowed its banks and
made the central land impassable, the
fences had been broken down by it, and
the fields of corn laid low; a few wretched
peasants were wandering about there;
they looked half clad and half starved.
"A miserable valley indeed!" exclaimed
the prince; but as he said it a man came
down from the hills with a great bag of
gold in his hand.</p>

<p>"This valley is mine," said he to the
people; "I have bought it for gold.
Now make banks that the river may not
overflow, and I will give you gold; also
make fences and plant fields, and cover
in the roofs of your houses, and buy yourselves
richer clothing." So the people
did so, and as the gold got lower in the
bag the valley grew fairer and greener,
till the prince exclaimed, "O gold, I see
your value now! O wonderful, beneficent
gold!"</p>

<p>But presently the valley melted away
like a mist, and the prince saw an army
besieging a city; he heard a general
haranguing his soldiers to urge them on,
and the soldiers shouting and battering
the walls; but shortly, when the city was
well-nigh taken, he saw some men
secretly throwing gold among the soldiers,
so much of it that they threw down
their arms to pick it up, and said that the
walls were so strong that they could not
throw them down. "O powerful gold!"
thought the prince; "thou art stronger
than the city walls!"</p>

<p>After that it seemed to himself that he
was walking about in a desert country,
and in his dream he thought, "Now I
know what labor is, for I have seen it,
and its benefits; and I know what liberty
is, for I have tasted it; I can wander
where I will, and no man questions me;
but gold is more strange to me than ever,
for I have seen it buy both liberty and
labor." Shortly after this he saw a great
crowd digging upon a barren hill, and
when he drew near he understood that
he had reached the summit of his wishes,
and that he was to see the place where
the gold came from.</p>

<p>He came up and stood a long time
watching the people as they toiled ready
to faint in the sun, so great was the labor
of digging the gold.</p>

<p>He saw who had much and could not
trust any one to help them to carry it,
binding it in bundles over their shoulders,
and bending and groaning under its
weight; he saw others hide it in the
ground, and watch the place clothed in
rags, that none might suspect that they
were rich; but some, on the contrary, who
had dug up an unusual quantity, he saw
dancing and singing, and vaunting their
success, till robbers waylaid them when
they slept, and rifled their bundles and
carried their golden sand away.</p>

<p>"All these men are mad," thought the
prince, "and this pernicious gold has
made them so."</p>

<p>After this, as he wandered here and
there, he saw groups of people smelting
the gold under the shadow of the trees,
and he observed that a dancing, quivering
vapor rose up from it, which dazzled their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
eyes, and distorted everything that they
looked at; arraying it also in different
colors from the true one. He observed
that this vapor from the gold caused all
things to rock and reel before the eyes of
those who looked through it, and also,
by some strange affinity, it drew their
hearts towards those that carried much
gold on their persons, so that they called
them good and beautiful; it also caused
them to see darkness and dullness in the
faces of those who carried none. "This,"
thought the prince, "is very strange";
but not being able to explain it, he went
still further, and there he saw more people.
Each of these had adorned himself with a
broad golden girdle, and was sitting in the
shade, while other men waited on them.</p>

<p>"What ails these people?" he inquired
of one who was looking on, for he observed
a peculiar air of weariness and dullness
in their faces. He was answered that
the girdles were very tight and heavy,
and being bound over the regions of the
heart, were supposed to impede its action,
and prevent it from beating high, and also
to chill the wearer, as being of opaque
material, the warm sunshine of the earth
could not get through to warm him.</p>

<p>"Why, then, do they not break them
asunder," exclaimed the prince, "and
fling them away?"</p>

<p>"Break them asunder!" cried the
man; "why what a madman you must be;
they are made of the purest gold!"</p>

<p>"Forgive my ignorance," replied the
prince; "I am a stranger."</p>

<p>So he walked on, for feelings of delicacy
prevented him from gazing any
longer at the men with the golden girdles;
but as he went he pondered on the misery
he had seen, and thought to himself that
this golden sand did more mischief than
all the poisons of the apothecary; for it
dazzled the eyes of some, it strained the
hearts of others, it bowed down the heads
of many to the earth with its weight; it
was a sore labor to gather it, and when
it was gathered, the robber might carry
it away; it would be a good thing, he
thought, if there were none of it.</p>

<p>After this he came to a place where
were sitting some aged widows and some
orphan children of the gold-diggers, who
were helpless and destitute; they were
weeping and bemoaning themselves, but
stopped at the approach of a man, whose
appearance attracted the prince, for he had
a very great bundle of gold on his back,
and yet it did not bow him down at all;
his apparel was rich but he had no girdle
on, and his face was anything but sad.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the prince to him, "you
have a great burden; you are fortunate to
be able to stand under it."</p>

<p>"I could not do so," he replied, "only
that as I go on I keep lightening it"; and
as he passed each of the widows, he threw
gold to her, and stooping down, hid pieces
of it in the bosoms of the children.</p>

<p>"You have no girdle," said the prince.</p>

<p>"I once had one," answered the gold
gatherer; "but it was so tight over my
breast that my very heart grew cold
under it, and almost ceased to beat.
Having a great quantity of gold on my
back, I felt almost at the last gasp; so I
threw off my girdle and being on the bank
of a river, which I knew not how to cross,
I was about to fling it in, I was so vexed!
'But no,' thought I, 'there are many
people waiting here to cross besides myself.
I will make my girdle into a bridge,
and we will cross over on it.'"</p>

<p>"Turn your girdle into a bridge!"
exclaimed the prince doubtfully, for he
did not quite understand.</p>

<p>The man explained himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then, sir, after that," he continued,
"I turned one half of my burden
into bread, and gave it to these poor
people. Since then I have not been
oppressed by its weight, however heavy
it may have been; for few men have a
heavier one. In fact, I gather more from
day to day."</p>

<p>As the man kept speaking, he scattered
his gold right and left with a cheerful
countenance, and the prince was about
to reply, when suddenly a great trembling
under his feet made him fall to the ground.
The refining fires of the gold gatherers
sprang up into flames, and then went out;
night fell over everything on the earth,
and nothing was visible in the sky but
the stars of the southern cross, which
were glittering above him.</p>

<p>"It is past midnight," thought the
prince, "for the stars of the cross begin
to bend."</p>

<p>He raised himself upon his elbow, and
tried to pierce the darkness, but could
not. At length a slender blue flame
darted out, as from ashes in a chafing-dish,
and by the light of it he saw the
strange pattern of his carpet and the
cushions lying about. He did not recognise
them at first, but presently he knew
that he was lying in his usual place, at
the top of his tower.</p>

<p>"Wake up, prince," said the old man.</p>

<p>The prince sat up and sighed, and the
old man inquired what he had seen.</p>

<p>"O man of much learning!" answered
the prince, "I have seen that this is a
wonderful world; I have seen the value
of labor, and I know the uses of it; I have
tasted the sweetness of liberty, and am
grateful, though it was but in a dream;
but as for that other word that was so
great a mystery to me, I only know this,
that it must remain a mystery forever,
since I am fain to believe that all men are
bent on getting it; though, once gotten,
it causeth them endless disquietude, only
second to their discomfort that are without
it. I am fain to believe that they can
procure with it whatever they most
desire, and yet that it cankers their
hearts and dazzles their eyes; that it is
their nature and their duty to gather it;
and yet that, when once gathered, the
best thing they can do is to scatter it!"</p>

<p>Alas! the prince visited this wonderful
world no more; for the next morning,
when he awoke, the old man was gone.
He had taken with him the golden cup
which the prince had given him. And
the sentinel was also gone, none knew
whither. Perhaps the old man had
turned his golden cup into a golden key.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_203" id="Note_203">203</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Few modern writers have given their readers
more genuine delight than Frank R.
Stockton (1834-1902). The most absurd
and illogical situations and characters are
presented with an air of such quiet sincerity
that one refuses to question the reality of
it all. <i>Rudder Grange</i> established his reputation
in 1879, and was followed by a long
list of stories of delightfully impossible
events. For several years Stockton was
one of the editors of <i>St. Nicholas</i>, and some
of his stories for children, of first quality
in both form and content, deserve to be
better known than they are. Five of the
best of them for school use have been
brought together in a little volume called
<i>Fanciful Tales</i>. One of these, "Old Pipes
and the Dryad," is given here by permission
of the publishers, Charles Scribner's Sons,
New York. (Copyright, 1894.) This
story is based upon the old mythical belief
that the trees are inhabited by guardian
deities known as dryads, or hamadryads.
To injure a tree meant to injure its guardian
spirit and was almost certain to insure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
disaster for the guilty person. On the other
hand, to protect a tree would bring some
token of appreciation from the dryad. A
good introduction to the story would be
the telling of one or two of these tree myths
as found in Gayley's <i>Classic Myths</i> or
Bulfinch's <i>Age of Fable</i>. A fine literary
version of one of them is in Lowell's
"Rhoecus." But the beautiful and kindly
helpfulness of Old Pipes will carry its own
message whether one knows any mythology
or not.</div>


<h4><br />OLD PIPES AND THE DRYAD</h4>

<div class='center'>FRANK R. STOCKTON</div>

<p>A Mountain brook ran through a little
village. Over the brook there was a
narrow bridge, and from the bridge a
foot-path led out from the village and
up the hill-side, to the cottage of Old
Pipes and his mother.</p>

<p>For many, many years Old Pipes had
been employed by the villagers to pipe
the cattle down from the hills. Every
afternoon, an hour before sunset, he
would sit on a rock in front of his cottage
and play on his pipes. Then all the
flocks and herds that were grazing on the
mountains would hear him, wherever
they might happen to be, and would
come down to the village&mdash;the cows by
the easiest paths, the sheep by those
not quite so easy, and the goats by the
steep and rocky ways that were hardest
of all.</p>

<p>But now, for a year or more, Old Pipes
had not piped the cattle home. It is
true that every afternoon he sat upon
the rock and played upon his pipes; but
the cattle did not hear him. He had
grown old, and his breath was feeble.
The echoes of his cheerful notes, which
used to come from the rocky hill on the
other side of the valley, were heard no
more; and twenty yards from Old Pipes
one could scarcely tell what tune he was
playing. He had become somewhat deaf,
and did not know that the sound of his
pipes was so thin and weak, and that the
cattle did not hear him. The cows, the
sheep, and the goats came down every
afternoon as before; but this was because
two boys and a girl were sent up after
them. The villagers did not wish the
good old man to know that his piping
was no longer of any use; so they paid
him his little salary every month, and
said nothing about the two boys and the
girl.</p>

<p>Old Pipes's mother was, of course, a
great deal older than he was, and was
as deaf as a gate&mdash;post, latch, hinges,
and all&mdash;and she never knew that the
sound of her son's pipe did not spread
over all the mountain-side and echo
back strong and clear from the opposite
hills. She was very fond of Old Pipes,
and proud of his piping; and as he was
so much younger than she was, she
never thought of him as being very old.
She cooked for him, and made his bed,
and mended his clothes; and they lived
very comfortably on his little salary.</p>

<p>One afternoon, at the end of the month,
when Old Pipes had finished his piping,
he took his stout staff and went down
the hill to the village to receive the
money for his month's work. The path
seemed a great deal steeper and more
difficult than it used to be; and Old
Pipes thought that it must have been
washed by the rains and greatly damaged.
He remembered it as a path that
was quite easy to traverse either up or
down. But Old Pipes had been a very
active man, and as his mother was so
much older than he was, he never thought
of himself as aged and infirm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Chief Villager had paid
him, and he had talked a little with
some of his friends, Old Pipes started to
go home. But when he had crossed the
bridge over the brook, and gone a short
distance up the hill-side, he became very
tired, and sat down upon a stone. He
had not been sitting there half a minute,
when along came two boys and a girl.</p>

<p>"Children," said Old Pipes, "I'm
very tired to-night, and I don't believe I
can climb up this steep path to my home.
I think I shall have to ask you to help
me."</p>

<p>"We will do that," said the boys and
the girl, quite cheerfully; and one boy
took him by the right hand and the other
by the left, while the girl pushed him in
the back. In this way he went up the
hill quite easily, and soon reached his
cottage door. Old Pipes gave each of
the three children a copper coin, and then
they sat down for a few minutes' rest
before starting back to the village.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry that I tired you so much,"
said Old Pipes.</p>

<p>"Oh, that would not have tired us,"
said one of the boys, "if we had not
been so far to-day after the cows, the
sheep, and the goats. They rambled
high up on the mountain, and we never
before had such a time in finding them."</p>

<p>"Had to go after the cows, the sheep,
and the goats!" exclaimed Old Pipes.
"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>The girl, who stood behind the old
man, shook her head, put her hand on
her mouth, and made all sorts of signs
to the boy to stop talking on this subject;
but he did not notice her, and
promptly answered Old Pipes.</p>

<p>"Why, you see, good sir," said he,
"that as the cattle can't hear your
pipes now, somebody has to go after
them every evening to drive them down
from the mountain, and the Chief
Villager has hired us three to do it.
Generally it is not very hard work, but
to-night the cattle had wandered far."</p>

<p>"How long have you been doing
this?" asked the old man.</p>

<p>The girl shook her head and clapped
her hand on her mouth as before, but
the boy went on.</p>

<p>"I think it is about a year now," he
said, "since the people first felt sure
that the cattle could not hear your
pipes; and from that time we've been
driving them down. But we are rested
now, and will go home. Good-night,
sir."</p>

<p>The three children then went down
the hill, the girl scolding the boy all the
way home. Old Pipes stood silent a few
moments, and then he went into his
cottage.</p>

<p>"Mother," he shouted, "did you hear
what those children said?"</p>

<p>"Children!" exclaimed the old woman;
"I did not hear them. I did not know
there were any children here."</p>

<p>Then Old Pipes told his mother&mdash;shouting
very loudly to make her hear&mdash;how
the two boys and the girl had helped
him up the hill, and what he had heard
about his piping and the cattle.</p>

<p>"They can't hear you?" cried his
mother. "Why, what's the matter with
the cattle?"</p>

<p>"Ah, me!" said Old Pipes; "I don't
believe there's anything the matter with
the cattle. It must be with me and
my pipes that there is something the
matter. But one thing is certain: if I
do not earn the wages the Chief Villager
pays me, I shall not take them. I shall
go straight down to the village and give
back the money I received to-day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried his mother. "I'm
sure you've piped as well as you could,
and no more can be expected. And
what are we to do without the money?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Old Pipes; "but
I'm going down to the village to pay
it back."</p>

<p>The sun had now set; but the moon
was shining very brightly on the hill-side,
and Old Pipes could see his way
very well. He did not take the same
path by which he had gone before, but
followed another, which led among the
trees upon the hill-side, and, though
longer, was not so steep.</p>

<p>When he had gone about half-way, the
old man sat down to rest, leaning his
back against a great oak tree. As he
did so, he heard a sound like knocking
inside the tree, and then a voice said:</p>

<p>"Let me out! let me out!"</p>

<p>Old Pipes instantly forgot that he was
tired, and sprang to his feet. "This
must be a Dryad tree!" he exclaimed.
"If it is, I'll let her out."</p>

<p>Old Pipes had never, to his knowledge,
seen a Dryad tree, but he knew there
were such trees on the hill-sides and the
mountains, and that Dryads lived in
them. He knew, too, that in the summer
time, on those days when the moon rose
before the sun went down, a Dryad
could come out of her tree if any one
could find the key which locked her in,
and turn it. Old Pipes closely examined
the trunk of the tree, which stood in
the full moonlight. "If I see that key,"
he said, "I shall surely turn it." Before
long he found a piece of bark standing
out from the tree, which looked to him
very much like the handle of a key. He
took hold of it, and found he could turn
it quite around. As he did so, a large
part of the side of the tree was pushed
open, and a beautiful <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Dyrad'">Dryad</ins> stepped
quickly out.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood motionless,
gazing on the scene before her&mdash;the
tranquil valley, the hills, the forest, and
the mountain-side, all lying in the soft
clear light of the moon. "Oh, lovely!
lovely!" she exclaimed. "How long it
is since I have seen anything like this!"
And then, turning to Old Pipes, she
said: "How good of you to let me out!
I am so happy, and so thankful, that I
must kiss you, you dear old man!"
And she threw her arms around the
neck of Old Pipes, and kissed him on
both cheeks.</p>

<p>"You don't know," she then went on
to say, "how doleful it is to be shut up
so long in a tree. I don't mind it in
the winter, for then I am glad to be
sheltered, but in summer it is a rueful
thing not to be able to see all the beauties
of the world. And it's ever so long since
I've been let out. People so seldom
come this way; and when they do come
at the right time, they either don't
hear me or they are frightened and run
away. But you, you dear old man, you
were not frightened, and you looked and
looked for the key, and you let me out;
and now I shall not have to go back
till winter has come, and the air grows
cold. Oh, it is glorious! What can I
do for you, to show you how grateful
I am?"</p>

<p>"I am very glad," said Old Pipes, "that
I let you out, since I see that it makes you
so happy; but I must admit that I tried
to find the key because I had a great
desire to see a Dryad. But, if you wish
to do something for me, you can, if you
happen to be going down toward the
village."</p>

<p>"To the village!" exclaimed the Dryad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
"I will go anywhere for you, my kind
old benefactor."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Old Pipes, "I wish
you would take this little bag of money
to the Chief Villager and tell him that
Old Pipes cannot receive pay for the services
which he does not perform. It is
now more than a year that I have not
been able to make the cattle hear me,
when I piped to call them home. I did
not know this until to-night; but now
that I know it, I cannot keep the money,
and so I send it back." And, handing the
little bag to the Dryad, he bade her good-night,
and turned toward his cottage.</p>

<p>"Good-night," said the Dryad. "And
I thank you over, and over, and over
again, you good old man!"</p>

<p>Old Pipes walked toward his home,
very glad to be saved the fatigue of going
all the way down to the village and back
again. "To be sure," he said to himself,
"this path does not seem at all steep, and
I can walk along it very easily; but it
would have tired me dreadfully to come
up all the way from the village, especially
as I could not have expected those children
to help me again." When he
reached home his mother was surprised
to see him returning so soon.</p>

<p>"What!" she exclaimed; "have you
already come back? What did the Chief
Villager say? Did he take the money?"</p>

<p>Old Pipes was just about to tell her
that he had sent the money to the village
by a Dryad, when he suddenly reflected
that his mother would be sure to disapprove
such a proceeding, and so he merely
said he had sent it by a person whom he
had met.</p>

<p>"And how do you know that the person
will ever take it to the Chief Villager?"
cried his mother. "You will lose it, and
the villagers will never get it. Oh,
Pipes! Pipes! when will you be old
enough to have ordinary common-sense?"</p>

<p>Old Pipes considered that, as he was
already seventy years of age, he could
scarcely expect to grow any wiser; but he
made no remark on this subject, and,
saying that he doubted not that the
money would go safely to its destination,
he sat down to his supper. His mother
scolded him roundly, but he did not
mind it; and after supper he went out
and sat on a rustic chair in front of the
cottage to look at the moonlit village, and
to wonder whether or not the Chief
Villager really received the money. While
he was doing these two things, he went
fast asleep.</p>

<p>When Old Pipes left the Dryad, she
did not go down to the village with the
little bag of money. She held it in her
hand, and thought about what she had
heard. "This is a good and honest old
man," she said; "and it is a shame that
he should lose this money. He looked
as if he needed it, and I don't believe the
people in the village will take it from one
who has served them so long. Often,
when in my tree, have I heard the sweet
notes of his pipes. I am going to take
the money back to him." She did not
start immediately, because there were
so many beautiful things to look at; but
after awhile she went up to the cottage,
and, finding Old Pipes asleep in his chair,
she slipped the little bag into his coat-pocket,
and silently sped away.</p>

<p>The next day Old Pipes told his mother
that he would go up the mountain and
cut some wood. He had a right to get
wood from the mountain, but for a long
time he had been content to pick up the
dead branches which lay about his cottage.
To-day, however, he felt so strong
and vigorous that he thought he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
go and cut some fuel that would be better
than this. He worked all the morning,
and when he came back he did not feel
at all tired, and he had a very good appetite
for his dinner.</p>

<p>Now, Old Pipes knew a good deal about
Dryads; but there was one thing which,
although he had heard, he had forgotten.
This was, that a kiss from a Dryad made
a person ten years younger.</p>

<p>The people of the village knew this,
and they were very careful not to let any
child of ten years or younger go into the
woods where the Dryads were supposed
to be; for, if they should chance to be
kissed by one of these tree-nymphs, they
would be set back so far that they would
cease to exist.</p>

<p>A story was told in the village that a
very bad boy of eleven once ran away
into the woods, and had an adventure of
this kind; and when his mother found
him he was a little baby of one year old.
Taking advantage of her opportunity,
she brought him up more carefully than
she had done before, and he grew to be a
very good boy indeed.</p>

<p>Now Old Pipes had been kissed twice
by the Dryad, once on each cheek, and
he therefore felt as vigorous and active
as when he was a hale man of fifty.
His mother noticed how much work he
was doing, and told him that he need not
try in that way to make up for the loss of
his piping wages; for he would only tire
himself out, and get sick. But her son
answered that he had not felt so well for
years, and that he was quite able to work.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon, Old
Pipes, for the first time that day, put his
hand in his coat-pocket, and there, to
his amazement, he found the little bag
of money. "Well, well!" he exclaimed,
"I am stupid, indeed! I really thought
that I had seen a Dryad; but when I sat
down by that big oak tree I must have
gone to sleep and dreamed it all; and
then I came home, thinking I had given
the money to a Dryad, when it was in
my pocket all the time. But the Chief
Villager shall have the money. I shall
not take it to him to-day, but to-morrow
I wish to go to the village to see some of
my old friends; and then I shall give up
the money."</p>

<p>Toward the close of the afternoon,
Old Pipes, as had been his custom for
so many years, took his pipes from the
shelf on which they lay, and went out
to the rock in front of the cottage.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" cried
his mother. "If you will not consent
to be paid, why do you pipe?"</p>

<p>"I am going to pipe for my own
pleasure," said her son. "I am used
to it, and I do not wish to give it up.
It does not matter now whether the
cattle hear me or not, and I am sure
that my piping will injure no one."</p>

<p>When the good man began to play
upon his favorite instrument he was
astonished at the sound that came from
it. The beautiful notes of the pipes
sounded clear and strong down into the
valley, and spread over the hills, and
up the sides of the mountain beyond,
while, after a little interval, an echo
came back from the rocky hill on the
other side of the valley.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" he cried, "what has happened
to my pipes? They must have
been stopped up of late, but now they
are as clear and good as ever."</p>

<p>Again the merry notes went sounding
far and wide. The cattle on the mountain
heard them, and those that were
old enough remembered how these notes
had called them from their pastures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
every evening, and so they started down
the mountain-side, the others following.</p>

<p>The merry notes were heard in the
village below, and the people were much
astonished thereby. "Why, who can be
blowing the pipes of Old Pipes?" they
said. But, as they were all very busy,
no one went up to see. One thing, however,
was plain enough: the cattle were
coming down the mountain. And so the
two boys and the girl did not have to
go after them, and had an hour for play,
for which they were very glad.</p>

<p>The next morning Old Pipes started
down to the village with his money, and
on the way he met the Dryad. "Oh,
ho!" he cried, "is that you? Why, I
thought my letting you out of the tree
was nothing but a dream."</p>

<p>"A dream!" cried the Dryad; "if
you only knew how happy you have
made me, you would not think it merely
a dream. And has it not benefited you?
Do you not feel happier? Yesterday I
heard you playing beautifully on your
pipes."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," cried he. "I did not
understand it before, but I see it all
now. I have really grown younger. I
thank you, I thank you, good Dryad,
from the bottom of my heart. It was
the finding of the money in my pocket
that made me think it was a dream."</p>

<p>"Oh, I put it in when you were
asleep," she said, laughing, "because I
thought you ought to keep it. Good-by,
kind, honest man. May you live long,
and be as happy as I am now."</p>

<p>Old Pipes was greatly delighted when
he understood that he was really a
younger man; but that made no difference
about the money, and he kept on
his way to the village. As soon as he
reached it, he was eagerly questioned as
to who had been playing his pipes the
evening before, and when the people
heard that it was himself they were very
much surprised. Thereupon Old Pipes
told what had happened to him, and
then there was greater wonder, with
hearty congratulations and hand-shakes;
for Old Pipes was liked by everyone.
The Chief Villager refused to take his
money; and although Old Pipes said
that he had not earned it, everyone
present insisted that, as he would now
play on his pipes as before, he should
lose nothing because, for a time, he was
unable to perform his duty.</p>

<p>So Old Pipes was obliged to keep his
money, and after an hour or two spent
in conversation with his friends he
returned to his cottage.</p>

<p>There was one person, however, who
was not pleased with what had happened
to Old Pipes. This was an Echo-dwarf
who lived on the hills across the valley.
It was his work to echo back the notes
of the pipes whenever they could be
heard.</p>

<p>A great many other Echo-dwarfs lived
on these hills. They all worked, but in
different ways. Some echoed back the
songs of maidens, some the shouts of
children, and others the music that was
often heard in the village. But there
was only one who could send back the
strong notes of the pipes of Old Pipes,
and this had been his sole duty for many
years. But when the old man grew
feeble, and the notes of his pipes could
not be heard on the opposite hills, this
Echo-dwarf had nothing to do, and he
spent his time in delightful idleness;
and he slept so much and grew so fat
that it made his companions laugh to
see him walk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>On the afternoon on which, after so
long an interval, the sound of the pipes
was heard on the echo hills, this dwarf
was fast asleep behind a rock. As soon
as the first notes reached them, some of
his companions ran to wake him up.
Rolling to his feet, he echoed back the
merry tune of Old Pipes.</p>

<p>Naturally, he was very angry at being
thus obliged to give up his life of comfort,
and he hoped very much that this
pipe-playing would not occur again.
The next afternoon he was awake and
listening, and, sure enough, at the usual
hour, along came the notes of the pipes
as clear and strong as they ever had
been; and he was obliged to work as
long as Old Pipes played. The Echo-dwarf
was very angry. He had supposed,
of course, that the pipe-playing
had ceased forever, and he felt that he
had a right to be indignant at being
thus deceived. He was so much disturbed
that he made up his mind to
go and try to find out how long this was
to last. He had plenty of time, as the
pipes were played but once a day, and
he set off early in the morning for the
hill on which Old Pipes lived. It was
hard work for the fat little fellow, and
when he had crossed the valley and had
gone some distance into the woods on
the hill-side, he stopped to rest, and in
a few minutes the Dryad came tripping
along.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" exclaimed the dwarf;
"what are you doing here? and how did
you get out of your tree?"</p>

<p>"Doing!" cried the Dryad; "I am
being happy; that's what I am doing.
And I was let out of my tree by the good
old man who plays the pipes to call the
cattle down from the mountain. And
it makes me happier to think that I
have been of service to him. I gave him
two kisses of gratitude, and now he is
young enough to play his pipes as well
as ever."</p>

<p>The Echo-dwarf stepped forward, his
face pale with passion. "Am I to believe,"
he said, "that you are the cause of this
great evil that has come upon me? and
that you are the wicked creature who has
again started this old man upon his career
of pipe-playing? What have I ever done
to you that you should have condemned
me for years and years to echo back the
notes of those wretched pipes?"</p>

<p>At this the Dryad laughed loudly.</p>

<p>"What a funny little fellow you are!"
she said. "Anyone would think you
had been condemned to toil from morning
till night; while what you really
have to do is merely to imitate for half
an hour every day the merry notes of
Old Pipes's piping. Fie upon you,
Echo-dwarf! You are lazy and selfish;
and that is what is the matter with
you. Instead of grumbling at being
obliged to do a little wholesome work,
which is less, I am sure, than that of
any other echo-dwarf upon the rocky
hill-side, you should rejoice at the good
fortune of the old man who has regained
so much of his strength and vigor. Go
home and learn to be just and generous;
and then, perhaps, you may be happy.
Good-by."</p>

<p>"Insolent creature!" shouted the
dwarf, as he shook his fat little fist
at her. "I'll make you suffer for this.
You shall find out what it is to heap
injury and insult upon one like me,
and to snatch from him the repose
that he has earned by long years of
toil." And, shaking his head savagely,
he hurried back to the rocky hill-side.</p>

<p>Every afternoon the merry notes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the pipes of Old Pipes sounded down
into the valley and over the hills and
up the mountain-side; and every afternoon
when he had echoed them back,
the little dwarf grew more and more
angry with the Dryad. Each day, from
early morning till it was time for him
to go back to his duties upon the rocky
hill-side, he searched the woods for her.
He intended, if he met her, to pretend
to be very sorry for what he had said,
and he thought he might be able to play
a trick upon her which would avenge
him well.</p>

<p>One day, while thus wandering among
the trees, he met Old Pipes. The Echo-dwarf
did not generally care to see or
speak to ordinary people; but now he was
so anxious to find the object of his search,
that he stopped and asked Old Pipes if
he had seen the Dryad. The piper had
not noticed the little fellow, and he
looked down on him with some surprise.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "I have not seen her,
and I have been looking everywhere for
her."</p>

<p>"You!" cried the dwarf, "what do
you wish with her?"</p>

<p>Old Pipes then sat down on a stone,
so that he should be nearer the ear of
his small companion, and he told what
the Dryad had done for him.</p>

<p>When the Echo-dwarf heard that this
was the man whose pipes he was obliged
to echo back every day, he would have
slain him on the spot, had he been able;
but, as he was not able, he merely ground
his teeth and listened to the rest of the
story.</p>

<p>"I am looking for the Dryad now,"
Old Pipes continued, "on account of my
aged mother. When I was old myself,
I did not notice how very old my mother
was; but now it shocks me to see how
feeble her years have caused her to become;
and I am looking for the Dryad
to ask her to make my mother younger,
as she made me."</p>

<p>The eyes of the Echo-dwarf glistened.
Here was a man who might help him in
his plans.</p>

<p>"Your idea is a good one," he said to
Old Pipes, "and it does you honor.
But you should know that a Dryad can
make no person younger but one who lets
her out of her tree. However, you can
manage the affair very easily. All you
need do is to find the Dryad, tell her
what you want, and request her to step
into her tree and be shut up for a short
time. Then you will go and bring your
mother to the tree; she will open it, and
everything will be as you wish. Is not
this a good plan?"</p>

<p>"Excellent!" cried Old Pipes; "and I
will go instantly and search more diligently
for the Dryad."</p>

<p>"Take me with you," said the Echo-dwarf.
"You can easily carry me on
your strong shoulders; and I shall be
glad to help you in any way that I can."</p>

<p>"Now then," said the little fellow to
himself, as Old Pipes carried him rapidly
along, "if he persuades the Dryad to get
into a tree,&mdash;and she is quite foolish
enough to do it,&mdash;and then goes away to
bring his mother, I shall take a stone or
a club and I will break off the key of that
tree, so that nobody can ever turn it
again. Then Mistress Dryad will see
what she has brought upon herself by her
behavior to me."</p>

<p>Before long they came to the great oak
tree in which the Dryad had lived, and
at a distance they saw that beautiful
creature herself coming toward them.</p>

<p>"How excellently well everything happens!"
said the dwarf. "Put me down,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and I will go. Your business with the
Dryad is more important than mine; and
you need not say anything about my having
suggested your plan to you. I am
willing that you should have all the credit
of it yourself."</p>

<p>Old Pipes put the Echo-dwarf upon the
ground, but the little rogue did not go
away. He hid himself between some
low, mossy rocks, and he was so much
like them in color that you would not
have noticed him if you had been looking
straight at him.</p>

<p>When the Dryad came up, Old Pipes
lost no time in telling her about his
mother, and what he wished her to do.
At first, the Dryad answered nothing,
but stood looking very sadly at Old Pipes.</p>

<p>"Do you really wish me to go into my
tree again?" she said. "I should dreadfully
dislike to do it, for I don't know
what might happen. It is not at all
necessary, for I could make your mother
younger at any time if she would give me
the opportunity. I had already thought
of making you still happier in this way,
and several times I have waited about
your cottage, hoping to meet your aged
mother, but she never comes outside, and
you know a Dryad cannot enter a house.
I cannot imagine what put this idea into
your head. Did you think of it yourself?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot say that I did," answered
Old Pipes. "A little dwarf whom
I met in the woods proposed it to me."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the Dryad; "now I see
through it all. It is the scheme of that
vile Echo-dwarf&mdash;your enemy and mine.
Where is he? I should like to see him."</p>

<p>"I think he has gone away," said Old
Pipes.</p>

<p>"No, he has not," said the Dryad,
whose quick eyes perceived the Echo-dwarf
among the rocks, "there he is.
Seize him and drag him out, I beg of you."</p>

<p>Old Pipes saw the dwarf as soon as he
was pointed out to him; and running to
the rocks, he caught the little fellow by
the arm and pulled him out.</p>

<p>"Now, then," cried the Dryad, who
had opened the door of the great oak,
"just stick him in there, and we will
shut him up. Then I shall be safe
from his mischief for the rest of the time
I am free."</p>

<p>Old Pipes thrust the Echo-dwarf into
the tree; the Dryad pushed the door
shut; there was a clicking sound of
bark and wood, and no one would have
noticed that the big oak had ever had
an opening in it.</p>

<p>"There," said the Dryad; "now we
need not be afraid of him. And I
assure you, my good piper, that I shall
be very glad to make your mother
younger as soon as I can. Will you not
ask her to come out and meet me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will," cried Old Pipes;
"and I will do it without delay."</p>

<p>And then, the Dryad by his side, he
hurried to his cottage. But when he
mentioned the matter to his mother,
the old woman became very angry
indeed. She did not believe in Dryads;
and, if they really did exist, she knew
they must be witches and sorceresses,
and she would have nothing to do with
them. If her son had ever allowed
himself to be kissed by one of them, he
ought to be ashamed of himself. As to
its doing him the least bit of good, she
did not believe a word of it. He felt
better than he used to feel, but that was
very common. She had sometimes felt
that way herself, and she forbade him
ever to mention a Dryad to her again.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Old Pipes, feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
very sad that his plan in regard to his
mother had failed, sat down upon the
rock and played upon his pipes. The
pleasant sounds went down the valley
and up the hills and mountain, but, to
the great surprise of some persons who
happened to notice the fact, the notes
were not echoed back from the rocky
hill-side, but from the woods on the
side of the valley on which Old Pipes
lived. The next day many of the villagers
stopped in their work to listen
to the echo of the pipes coming from
the woods. The sound was not as clear
and strong as it used to be when it was
sent back from the rocky hill-side, but
it certainly came from among the trees.
Such a thing as an echo changing its
place in this way had never been heard
of before, and nobody was able to
explain how it could have happened.
Old Pipes, however, knew very well
that the sound came from the Echo-dwarf
shut up in the great oak tree.
The sides of the tree were thin, and the
sound of the pipes could be heard through
them, and the dwarf was obliged by the
laws of his being to echo back those
notes whenever they came to him. But
Old Pipes thought he might get the
Dryad in trouble if he let anyone know
that the Echo-dwarf was shut up in the
tree, and so he wisely said nothing
about it.</p>

<p>One day the two boys and the girl
who had helped Old Pipes up the hill were
playing in the woods. Stopping near
the great oak tree, they heard a sound
of knocking within it, and then a voice
plainly said:</p>

<p>"Let me out! let me out!"</p>

<p>For a moment the children stood still
in astonishment, and then one of the
boys exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, it is a Dryad, like the one Old
Pipes found! Let's let her out!"</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of?" cried
the girl. "I am the oldest of all, and
I am only thirteen. Do you wish to
be turned into crawling babies? Run!
run! run!"</p>

<p>And the two boys and the girl dashed
down into the valley as fast as their
legs could carry them. There was no
desire in their youthful hearts to be
made younger than they were, and for
fear that their parents might think it
well that they should commence their
careers anew, they never said a word
about finding the Dryad tree.</p>

<p>As the summer days went on, Old
Pipes's mother grew feebler and feebler.
One day when her son was away, for
he now frequently went into the woods
to hunt or fish, or down into the valley
to work, she arose from her knitting to
prepare the simple dinner. But she
felt so weak and tired that she was not
able to do the work to which she had
been so long accustomed. "Alas! alas!"
she said, "the time has come when I
am too old to work. My son will have
to hire some one to come here and cook
his meals, make his bed, and mend his
clothes. Alas! alas! I had hoped that
as long as I lived I should be able to do
these things. But it is not so. I have
grown utterly worthless, and some one
else must prepare the dinner for my son.
I wonder where he is." And tottering
to the door, she went outside to look for
him. She did not feel able to stand, and
reaching the rustic chair, she sank into
it, quite exhausted, and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>The Dryad, who had often come to
the cottage to see if she could find an
opportunity of carrying out Old Pipes's
affectionate design, now happened by;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and seeing that the much-desired occasion
had come, she stepped up quietly
behind the old woman and gently kissed
her on each cheek, and then as quietly
disappeared.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the mother of Old
Pipes awoke, and looking up at the sun,
she exclaimed: "Why, it is almost dinner-time!
My son will be here directly, and
I am not ready for him." And rising to
her feet, she hurried into the house, made
the fire, set the meat and vegetables to
cook, laid the cloth, and by the time her
son arrived the meal was on the table.</p>

<p>"How a little sleep does refresh one,"
she said to herself, as she was bustling
about. She was a woman of very vigorous
constitution, and at seventy had
been a great deal stronger and more
active than her son was at that age.
The moment Old Pipes saw his mother,
he knew that the Dryad had been there;
but, while he felt as happy as a king, he
was too wise to say anything about her.</p>

<p>"It is astonishing how well I feel
to-day," said his mother; "and either
my hearing has improved or you speak
much more plainly than you have done
of late."</p>

<p>The summer days went on and passed
away, the leaves were falling from the
trees, and the air was becoming cold.</p>

<p>"Nature has ceased to be lovely,"
said the Dryad, "and the night winds
chill me. It is time for me to go back
into my comfortable quarters in the
great oak. But first I must pay another
visit to the cottage of Old Pipes."</p>

<p>She found the piper and his mother
sitting side by side on the rock in front
of the door. The cattle were not to
go to the mountain any more that
season, and he was piping them down
for the last time. Loud and merrily
sounded the pipes of Old Pipes, and down
the mountain-side came the cattle, the
cows by the easiest paths, the sheep by
those not quite so easy, and the goats
by the most difficult ones among the
rocks; while from the great oak tree were
heard the echoes of the cheerful music.</p>

<p>"How happy they look, sitting there
together," said the Dryad; "and I
don't believe it will do them a bit of
harm to be still younger." And moving
quietly up behind them, she first kissed
Old Pipes on his cheek and then kissed
his mother.</p>

<p>Old Pipes, who had stopped playing,
knew what it was, but he did not move,
and said nothing. His mother, thinking
that her son had kissed her, turned
to him with a smile and kissed him in
return. And then she arose and went
into the cottage, a vigorous woman of
sixty, followed by her son, erect and
happy, and twenty years younger than
herself.</p>

<p>The Dryad sped away to the woods,
shrugging her shoulders as she felt the
cool evening wind.</p>

<p>When she reached the great oak, she
turned the key and opened the door.
"Come out," said she to the Echo-dwarf,
who sat blinking within. "Winter is
coming on, and I want the comfortable
shelter of my tree for myself. The
cattle have come down from the mountain
for the last time this year, the
pipes will no longer sound, and you
can go to your rocks and have a holiday
until next spring."</p>

<p>Upon hearing these words the dwarf
skipped quickly out, and the Dryad
entered the tree and pulled the door
shut after her. "Now, then," she said
to herself, "he can break off the key if
he likes. It does not matter to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Another will grow out next spring.
And although the good piper made me
no promise, I know that when the
warm days arrive next year, he will
come and let me out again."</p>

<p>The Echo-dwarf did not stop to break
the key of the tree. He was too happy
to be released to think of anything else,
and he hastened as fast as he could to
his home on the rocky hill-side.</p>

<p>The Dryad was not mistaken when she
trusted in the piper. When the warm
days came again he went to the oak
tree to let her out. But, to his sorrow
and surprise, he found the great tree
lying upon the ground. A winter storm
had blown it down, and it lay with its
trunk shattered and split. And what
became of the Dryad no one ever knew.</p>

<div class="hang1">John Ruskin (1819-1900), the most eloquent
of English prose writers, was much interested
in the question of literature for both
grown-ups and children. He edited a reissue
of Taylor's translation of Grimms' <i>Popular
Stories</i>, issued "Dame Wiggins of Lee and
Her Seven Wonderful Cats" (see No. <a href="#Note_143">143</a>),
and wrote that masterpiece among modern
stories for children, <i>The King of the Golden
River</i>. Its fine idealism, splendidly imagined
structure, wonderful word-paintings,
and perfect English all combine to justify
the high place assigned to it. Ruskin wrote
the story in 1841, at a "couple of sittings,"
though it was not published until ten years
later. Speaking of it later in life, he said
that it "was written to amuse a little girl;
and being a fairly good imitation of Grimm
and Dickens, mixed with a little true
Alpine feeling of my own, it has been rightly
pleasing to nice children, and good for them.
But it is totally valueless, for all that. I
can no more write a story than compose
a picture." The final statement may be
taken for what it is worth, written as it
was at a time of disillusionment. The
first part of Ruskin's analysis is certainly
true and has been thus expanded by his
biographer, Sir E. T. Cook: "The grotesque
and the German setting of the tale were
taken from Grimm; from Dickens it took
its tone of pervading kindliness and geniality.
The Alpine ecstasy and the eager
pressing of the moral were Ruskin's own;
and so also is the style, delicately poised
between poetry and comedy."</div>


<h4><br />THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER<br />
OR<br />
THE BLACK BROTHERS</h4>


<div class='center'>JOHN RUSKIN<br />
<br />
<br />
CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
HOW THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM OF THE BLACK
BROTHERS WAS INTERFERED WITH BY
SOUTH-WEST WIND, ESQUIRE</div>

<p>In a secluded and mountainous part
of Stiria there was, in old time, a valley
of the most surprising and luxuriant
fertility. It was surrounded, on all
sides, by steep and rocky mountains,
rising into peaks, which were always
covered with snow, and from which a
number of torrents descended in constant
cataracts. One of these fell westward,
over the face of a crag so high,
that, when the sun had set to everything
else, and all below was darkness, his
beams still shone full upon this waterfall,
so that it looked like a shower of
gold. It was, therefore, called by the
people of the neighborhood, the Golden
River. It was strange that none of
these streams fell into the valley itself.
They all descended on the other side of
the mountains, and wound away through
broad plains and by populous cities.
But the clouds were drawn so constantly
to the snowy hills, and rested so softly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in the circular hollow, that in time of
drought and heat, when all the country
round was burnt up, there was still rain
in the little valley; and its crops were
so heavy, and its hay so high, and its
apples so red, and its grapes so blue, and
its wine so rich, and its honey so sweet,
that it was a marvel to every one who
beheld it, and was commonly called the
Treasure Valley.</p>

<p>The whole of this little valley belonged
to three brothers, called Schwartz, Hans,
and Gluck. Schwartz and Hans, the
two elder brothers, were very ugly men,
with overhanging eyebrows and small
dull eyes, which were always half shut,
so that you couldn't see into <i>them</i>, and
always fancied they saw very far into
<i>you</i>. They lived by farming the Treasure
Valley, and very good farmers they
were. They killed everything that did
not pay for its eating. They shot the
blackbirds because they pecked the fruit;
and killed the hedgehogs, lest they
should suck the cows; they poisoned
the crickets for eating the crumbs in
the kitchen; and smothered the cicadas,
which used to sing all summer in the
lime trees. They worked their servants
without any wages, till they would not
work any more, and then quarreled with
them, and turned them out of doors
without paying them. It would have
been very odd if, with such a farm, and
such a system of farming, they hadn't
got very rich; and very rich they <i>did</i>
get. They generally contrived to keep
their corn by them till it was very dear,
and then sell it for twice its value; they
had heaps of gold lying about on their
floors, yet it was never known that they
had given so much as a penny or a crust
in charity; they never went to mass;
grumbled perpetually at paying tithes;
and were, in a word, of so cruel and grinding
a temper as to receive from all those
with whom they had any dealings the
nickname of the "Black Brothers."</p>

<p>The youngest brother, Gluck, was as
completely opposed, in both appearance
and character, to his seniors as could
possibly be imagined or desired. He
was not above twelve years old, fair,
blue-eyed, and kind in temper to every
living thing. He did not, of course,
agree particularly well with his brothers,
or rather, they did not agree with <i>him</i>.
He was usually appointed to the honorable
office of turnspit, when there was
anything to roast, which was not often;
for, to do the brothers justice, they were
hardly less sparing upon themselves
than upon other people. At other times
he used to clean the shoes, floors, and
sometimes the plates, occasionally getting
what was left on them, by way of
encouragement, and a wholesome quantity
of dry blows, by way of education.</p>

<p>Things went on in this manner for a
long time. At last came a very wet
summer, and everything went wrong in
the country around. The hay had hardly
been got in, when the haystacks were
floated bodily down to the sea by an
inundation; the vines were cut to pieces
with the hail; the corn was all killed by
a black blight; only in the Treasure
Valley, as usual, all was safe. As it had
rain when there was rain nowhere else,
so it had sun when there was sun nowhere
else. Everybody came to buy corn at
the farm, and went away pouring maledictions
on the Black Brothers. They
asked what they liked, and got it, except
from the poor people, who could only
beg, and several of whom were starved
at their very door, without the slightest
regard or notice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>It was drawing towards winter, and
very cold weather, when one day the
two elder brothers had gone out, with
their usual warning to little Gluck, who
was left to mind the roast, that he was
to let nobody in, and give nothing out.
Gluck sat down quite close to the fire,
for it was raining very hard, and the
kitchen walls were by no means dry or
comfortable looking. He turned and
turned, and the roast got nice and brown.
"What a pity," thought Gluck, "my
brothers never ask anybody to dinner.
I'm sure, when they've got such a nice
piece of mutton as this, and nobody else
has got so much as a piece of dry bread,
it would do their hearts good to have
somebody to eat it with them."</p>

<p>Just as he spoke, there came a double
knock at the house door, yet heavy and
dull, as though the knocker had been tied
up&mdash;more like a puff than a knock.</p>

<p>"It must be the wind," said Gluck;
"nobody else would venture to knock
double knocks at our door."</p>

<p>No; it wasn't the wind; there it came
again very hard, and what was particularly
astounding, the knocker seemed to
be in a hurry, and not to be in the least
afraid of the consequences. Gluck went
to the window, opened it, and put his
head out to see who it was.</p>

<p>It was the most extraordinary looking
little gentleman he had ever seen in his
life. He had a very large nose, slightly
brass-colored; his cheeks were very
round, and very red, and might have
warranted a supposition that he had
been blowing a refractory fire for the
last eight-and-forty hours; his eyes
twinkled merrily through long silky eyelashes,
his mustaches curled twice round
like a corkscrew on each side of his
mouth, and his hair, of a curious mixed
pepper-and-salt color, descended far over
his shoulders. He was about four-feet-six
in height, and wore a conical pointed
cap of nearly the same altitude, decorated
with a black feather some three feet long.
His doublet was prolonged behind into
something resembling a violent exaggeration
of what is now termed a "swallowtail,"
but was much obscured by the
swelling folds of an enormous black,
glossy-looking cloak, which must have
been very much too long in calm weather,
as the wind, whistling round the old
house, carried it clear out from the wearer's
shoulders to about four times his
own length.</p>

<p>Gluck was so perfectly paralyzed by
the singular appearance of his visitor,
that he remained fixed without uttering
a word, until the old gentleman,
having performed another, and a more
energetic concerto on the knocker, turned
round to look after his fly-away cloak.
In so doing he caught sight of Gluck's
little yellow head jammed in the window,
with its mouth and eyes very wide open
indeed.</p>

<p>"Hollo!" said the little gentleman,
"that's not the way to answer the door:
I'm wet; let me in!"</p>

<p>To do the little gentleman justice,
he <i>was</i> wet. His feather hung down
between his legs like a beaten puppy's
tail, dripping like an umbrella; and from
the ends of his mustaches the water
was running into his waistcoat pockets,
and out again like a mill stream.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, sir," said Gluck,
"I'm very sorry, but I really can't."</p>

<p>"Can't what?" said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"I can't let you in, sir,&mdash;I can't
indeed; my brothers would beat me to
death, sir, if I thought of such a thing.
What do you want, sir?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Want?" said the old gentleman,
petulantly. "I want fire, and shelter;
and there's your great fire there blazing,
crackling, and dancing on the walls, with
nobody to feel it. Let me in, I say; I
only want to warm myself."</p>

<p>Gluck had had his head, by this time, so
long out of the window, that he began to
feel it was really unpleasantly cold, and
when he turned, and saw the beautiful
fire rustling and roaring, and throwing
long bright tongues up the chimney,
as if it were licking its chops at the
savory smell of the leg of mutton, his
heart melted within him that it should
be burning away for nothing. "He does
look <i>very</i> wet," said little Gluck; "I'll
just let him in for a quarter of an hour."
Round he went to the door, and opened
it; and as the little gentleman walked in,
there came a gust of wind through the
house that made the old chimneys totter.</p>

<p>"That's a good boy," said the little
gentleman. "Never mind your brothers.
I'll talk to them."</p>

<p>"Pray, sir, don't do any such thing,"
said Gluck. "I can't let you stay till
they come; they'd be the death of me."</p>

<p>"Dear me," said the old gentleman,
"I'm very sorry to hear that. How
long may I stay?"</p>

<p>"Only till the mutton's done, sir,"
replied Gluck, "and it's very brown."</p>

<p>Then the old gentleman walked into
the kitchen, and sat himself down on
the hob, with the top of his cap accommodated
up the chimney, for it was a
great deal too high for the roof.</p>

<p>"You'll soon dry there, sir," said
Gluck, and sat down again to turn the
mutton. But the old gentleman did <i>not</i>
dry there, but went on drip, drip, dripping
among the cinders, and the fire
fizzed and sputtered, and began to look
very black and uncomfortable; never
was such a cloak; every fold in it ran
like a gutter.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, sir," said Gluck at
length, after watching the water spreading
in long, quicksilver-like streams over
the floor for a quarter of an hour; "mayn't
I take your cloak?"</p>

<p>"No thank you," said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Your cap, sir?"</p>

<p>"I am all right, thank you," said the
old gentleman rather gruffly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;sir&mdash;I'm very sorry," said
Gluck hesitatingly; "but&mdash;really, sir&mdash;you're&mdash;putting
the fire out."</p>

<p>"It'll take longer to do the mutton,
then," replied his visitor dryly.</p>

<p>Gluck was very much puzzled by the
behavior of his guest; it was such a
strange mixture of coolness and humility.
He turned away at the string meditatively
for another five minutes.</p>

<p>"That mutton looks very nice," said
the old gentleman at length. "Can't
you give me a little bit?"</p>

<p>"Impossible, sir," said Gluck.</p>

<p>"I'm very hungry," continued the old
gentleman; "I've had nothing to eat
yesterday nor to-day. They surely
couldn't miss a bit from the knuckle!"</p>

<p>He spoke in so very melancholy a
tone that it quite melted Gluck's heart.
"They promised me one slice to-day,
sir," said he; "I can give you that, but
not a bit more."</p>

<p>"That's a good boy," said the old
gentleman again.</p>

<p>Then Gluck warmed a plate, and
sharpened a knife. "I don't care if I
do get beaten for it," thought he. Just
as he had cut a large slice out of the
mutton, there came a tremendous rap
at the door. The old gentleman jumped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
off the hob, as if it had suddenly become
inconveniently warm. Gluck fitted the
slice into the mutton again, with desperate
efforts at exactitude, and ran to open
the door.</p>

<p>"What did you keep us waiting in
the rain for?" said Schwartz, as he
walked in, throwing his umbrella in
Gluck's face. "Ay! what for, indeed,
you little vagabond?" said Hans, administering
an educational box on the ear,
as he followed his brother into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" said Schwartz when
he opened the door.</p>

<p>"Amen," said the little gentleman,
who had taken his cap off and was
standing in the middle of the kitchen,
bowing with the utmost possible velocity.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" said Schwartz, catching
up a rolling-pin, and turning to
Gluck with a fierce frown.</p>

<p>"I don't know, indeed, brother," said
Gluck in great terror.</p>

<p>"How did he get in?" roared Schwartz.</p>

<p>"My dear brother," said Gluck, deprecatingly,
"he was so <i>very</i> wet!"</p>

<p>The rolling-pin was descending on
Gluck's head; but, at the instant, the
old gentleman interposed his conical
cap, on which it crashed with a shock
that shook the water out of it all over the
room. What was very odd, the rolling
pin no sooner touched the cap, than it
flew out of Schwartz's hand, spinning
like a straw in a high wind, and fell into
the corner at the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir?" demanded
Schwartz, turning upon him.</p>

<p>"What's your business?" snarled Hans.</p>

<p>"I'm a poor old man, sir," the little
gentleman began very modestly, "and
I saw your fire through the window, and
begged shelter for a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"Have the goodness to walk out again,
then," said Schwartz. "We've quite
enough water in our kitchen, without
making it a drying house."</p>

<p>"It is a cold day to turn an old man
out in, sir; look at my gray hairs."
They hung down to his shoulders, as I
told you before.</p>

<p>"Ay!" said Hans, "there are enough
of them to keep you warm. Walk!"</p>

<p>"I'm very, very hungry, sir; couldn't
you spare me a bit of bread before I go?"</p>

<p>"Bread, indeed!" said Schwartz; "do
you suppose we've nothing to do with
our bread but to give it to such red-nosed
fellows as you?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you sell your feather?"
said Hans, sneeringly. "Out with you!"</p>

<p>"A little bit," said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Be off!" said Schwartz.</p>

<p>"Pray, gentlemen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Off, and be hanged!" cried Hans,
seizing him by the collar. But he had
no sooner touched the old gentleman's
collar, than away he went after the
rolling-pin, spinning round and round,
till he fell into the corner on the top of
it. Then Schwartz was very angry, and
ran at the old gentleman to turn him
out; but he also had hardly touched
him, when away he went after Hans
and the rolling-pin, and hit his head
against the wall as he tumbled into the
corner. And so there they lay, all three.</p>

<p>Then the old gentleman spun himself
round with velocity in the opposite
direction; continued to spin until his
long cloak was all wound neatly about
him, clapped his cap on his head, very
much on one side (for it could not stand
upright without going through the ceiling),
gave an additional twist to his
corkscrew mustaches, and replied with
perfect coolness: "Gentlemen, I wish you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
a very good morning. At twelve o'clock
to-night I'll call again; after such a
refusal of hospitality as I have just experienced,
you will not be surprised if
that visit is the last I ever pay you."</p>

<p>"If ever I catch you here again,"
muttered Schwartz, coming, half frightened,
out of the corner&mdash;but, before he
could finish his sentence, the old gentleman
had shut the house door behind
him with a great bang: and there drove
past the window, at the same instant, a
wreath of ragged cloud that whirled
and rolled away down the valley in all
manner of shapes; turning over and
over in the air, and melting away at
last in a gush of rain.</p>

<p>"A very pretty business, indeed, Mr.
Gluck!" said Schwartz. "Dish the mutton,
sir. If ever I catch you at such a
trick again&mdash;bless me, why the mutton's
been cut!"</p>

<p>"You promised me one slice, brother,
you know," said Gluck.</p>

<p>"Oh! and you were cutting it hot, I
suppose, and going to catch all the gravy.
It'll be long before I promise you such
a thing again. Leave the room, sir;
and have the kindness to wait in the
coal-cellar till I call you."</p>

<p>Gluck left the room melancholy enough.
The brothers ate as much mutton as
they could, locked the rest in the cupboard,
and proceeded to get very drunk
after dinner.</p>

<p>Such a night as it was! Howling wind
and rushing rain, without intermission!
The brothers had just sense enough
left to put up all the shutters, and
double bar the door, before they went
to bed. They usually slept in the same
room. As the clock struck twelve,
they were both awakened by a tremendous
crash. Their door burst open with
a violence that shook the house from
top to bottom.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Schwartz, starting
up in his bed.</p>

<p>"Only I," said the little gentleman.</p>

<p>The two brothers sat up on their
bolster and stared into the darkness.
The room was full of water, and by a
misty moonbeam, which found its way
through a hole in the shutter, they could
see in the midst of it an enormous foam
globe, spinning round, and bobbing up and
down like a cork, on which, as on a most
luxurious cushion, reclined the little old
gentleman, cap and all. There was plenty
of room for it now, for the roof was off.</p>

<p>"Sorry to incommode you," said their
visitor, ironically. "I'm afraid your
beds are dampish; perhaps you had better
go to your brother's room; I've left the
ceiling on, there."</p>

<p>They required no second admonition,
but rushed into Gluck's room, wet
through, and in an agony of terror.</p>

<p>"You'll find my card on the kitchen
table," the old gentleman called after
them. "Remember, the <i>last</i> visit."</p>

<p>"Pray Heaven it may!" said Schwartz,
shuddering. And the foam globe disappeared.</p>

<p>Dawn came at last, and the two
brothers looked out of Gluck's little
window in the morning. The Treasure
Valley was one mass of ruin and desolation.
The inundation had swept away
trees, crops, and cattle, and left in their
stead a waste of red sand and gray mud.
The two brothers crept shivering and
horror-struck into the kitchen. The
water had gutted the whole first floor;
corn, money, almost every movable
thing had been swept away, and there
was left only a small white card on the
kitchen table. On it, in large, breezy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
long-legged letters, were engraved the
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">South-West Wind, Esquire</span>.</div>


<div class='center'>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE THREE BROTHERS
AFTER THE VISIT OF SOUTH-WEST WIND,
ESQUIRE; AND HOW LITTLE GLUCK HAD
AN INTERVIEW WITH THE KING
OF THE GOLDEN RIVER</div>

<p>South-West Wind, Esquire, was as
good as his word. After the momentous
visit above related, he entered the
Treasure Valley no more; and, what was
worse, he had so much influence with his
relations, the West Winds in general, and
used it so effectually, that they all
adopted a similar line of conduct. So
no rain fell in the valley from one year's
end to another. Though everything
remained green and flourishing in the
plains below, the inheritance of the Three
Brothers was a desert. What had once
been the richest soil in the kingdom, became
a shifting heap of red sand; and the
brothers, unable longer to contend with
the adverse skies, abandoned their valueless
patrimony in despair, to seek some
means of gaining a livelihood among the
cities and people of the plains. All their
money was gone, and they had nothing
left but some curious, old-fashioned
pieces of gold plates, the last remnants
of their ill-gotten wealth.</p>

<p>"Suppose we turn goldsmiths?" said
Schwartz to Hans, as they entered the
large city. "It is a good knave's trade;
we can put a great deal of copper into
the gold, without any one's finding it
out."</p>

<p>The thought was agreed to be a
very good one; they hired a furnace,
and turned goldsmiths. But two slight
circumstances affected their trade; the
first, that people did not approve of the
coppered gold; the second, that the two
elder brothers, whenever they had sold
anything, used to leave little Gluck to
mind the furnace, and go and drink out
the money in the ale-house next door.
So they melted all their gold, without
making money enough to buy more, and
were at last reduced to one large drinking
mug, which an uncle of his had given
to little Gluck, and which he was very
fond of, and would not have parted with
for the world; though he never drank
anything out of it but milk and water.
The mug was a very odd mug to look at.
The handle was formed of two wreaths
of flowing golden hair, so finely spun that
it looked more like silk than metal, and
these wreaths descended into, and mixed
with, a beard and whiskers of the same
exquisite workmanship, which surrounded
and decorated a very fierce little face, of
the reddest gold imaginable, right in the
front of the mug, with a pair of eyes in
it which seemed to command its whole
circumference. It was impossible to
drink out of the mug without being subjected
to an intense gaze out of the side
of these eyes; and Schwartz positively
averred that once, after emptying it,
full of Rhenish, seventeen times, he had
seen them wink! When it came to the
mug's turn to be made into spoons, it
half broke poor little Gluck's heart; but
the brothers only laughed at him, tossed
the mug into the melting-pot, and staggered
out to the ale-house; leaving him,
as usual, to pour the gold into bars,
when it was all ready.</p>

<p>When they were gone, Gluck took a
farewell look at his old friend in the
melting-pot. The flowing hair was all
gone; nothing remained but the red nose,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and the sparkling eyes, which looked
more malicious than ever. "And no
wonder," thought Gluck, "after being
treated in that way." He sauntered
disconsolately to the window, and sat
himself down to catch the fresh evening
air, and escape the hot breath of the
furnace. Now this window commanded
a direct view of the range of mountains,
which, as I told you before, overhung the
Treasure Valley, and more especially of
the peak from which fell the Golden
River. It was just at the close of the
day, and when Gluck sat down at the
window, he saw the rocks of the mountain
tops, all crimson and purple with the
sunset; and there were bright tongues of
fiery cloud burning and quivering about
them; and the river, brighter than all,
fell, in a waving column of pure gold,
from precipice to precipice, with the
double arch of a broad purple rainbow
stretched across it, flushing and fading
alternately in the wreaths of spray.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Gluck aloud, after he had
looked at it for a while, "if that river
were really all gold, what a nice thing it
would be."</p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't, Gluck," said a
clear metallic voice, close at his ear.</p>

<p>"Bless me! what's that?" exclaimed
Gluck, jumping up. There was nobody
there. He looked round the room, and
under the table, and a great many times
behind him, but there was certainly nobody
there, and he sat down again at
the window. This time he didn't speak,
but he couldn't help thinking again that
it would be very convenient if the river
were really all gold.</p>

<p>"Not at all, my boy," said the same
voice, louder than before.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said Gluck again; "what
<i>is</i> that?" He looked again into all the
corners, and cupboards, and then began
turning round, and round, as fast as he
could in the middle of the room, thinking
there was somebody behind him, when
the same voice struck again on his ear.
It was singing now very merrily, "Lala-lira-la";
no words, only a soft running
effervescent melody, something like that
of a kettle on the boil. Gluck looked
out of the window. No, it was certainly
in the house. Upstairs, and downstairs.
No, it was certainly in that very
room, coming in quicker time, and clearer
notes, every moment. "Lala-lira-la."
All at once it struck Gluck that it sounded
louder near the furnace. He ran to the
opening, and looked in; yes, he saw right,
it seemed to be coming, not only out of
the furnace, but out of the pot. He
uncovered it, and ran back in a great
fright, for the pot was certainly singing!
He stood in the farthest corner of the
room, with his hands up, and his mouth
open, for a minute or two, when the singing
stopped, and the voice became clear,
and pronunciative.</p>

<p>"Hollo!" said the voice.</p>

<p>Gluck made no answer.</p>

<p>"Hollo! Gluck, my boy," said the pot
again.</p>

<p>Gluck summoned all his energies,
walked straight up to the crucible, drew
it out of the furnace, and looked in. The
gold was all melted, and its surface as
smooth and polished as a river; but instead
of reflecting little Gluck's head, as
he looked in, he saw, meeting his glance
from beneath the gold, the red nose and
sharp eyes of his old friend of the mug,
a thousand times redder and sharper than
ever he had seen them in his life.</p>

<p>"Come, Gluck, my boy," said the
voice out of the pot again, "I'm all right;
pour me out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>But Gluck was too much astonished to
do anything of the kind.</p>

<p>"Pour me out, I say," said the voice
rather gruffly.</p>

<p>Still Gluck couldn't move.</p>

<p>"<i>Will</i> you pour me out?" said the
voice passionately. "I'm too hot."</p>

<p>By a violent effort, Gluck recovered
the use of his limbs, took hold of the
crucible, and sloped it so as to pour out
the gold. But instead of a liquid stream,
there came out, first, a pair of pretty little
yellow legs, then some coat tails, then a
pair of arms stuck a-kimbo, and, finally,
the well-known head of his friend the
mug; all which articles, uniting as they
rolled out, stood up energetically on the
floor, in the shape of a little golden
dwarf, about a foot and a half high.</p>

<p>"That's right!" said the dwarf, stretching
out first his legs and then his arms,
and then shaking his head up and down,
and as far round as it would go, for five
minutes, without stopping; apparently
with the view of ascertaining if he were
quite correctly put together, while Gluck
stood contemplating him in speechless
amazement. He was dressed in a slashed
doublet of spun gold, so fine in its texture
that the prismatic colors gleamed over
it, as if on a surface of mother of pearl;
and, over this brilliant doublet, his hair
and beard fell full halfway to the ground
in waving curls so exquisitely delicate
that Gluck could hardly tell where they
ended; they seemed to melt into air.
The features of the face, however, were
by no means finished with the same
delicacy; they were rather coarse, slightly
inclining to coppery in complexion, and
indicative, in expression, of a very pertinacious
and intractable disposition in
their small proprietor. When the dwarf
had finished his self-examination, he
turned his small sharp eyes full on Gluck
and stared at him deliberately for a
minute or two. "No, it wouldn't, Gluck,
my boy," said the little man.</p>

<p>This was certainly rather an abrupt
and unconnected mode of commencing
conversation. It might indeed be supposed
to refer to the course of Gluck's
thoughts, which had first produced the
dwarf's observations out of the pot; but
whatever it referred to, Gluck had no
inclination to dispute the dictum.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it, sir?" said Gluck, very
mildly and submissively indeed.</p>

<p>"No," said the dwarf, conclusively.
"No, it wouldn't." And with that, the
dwarf pulled his cap hard over his brows,
and took two turns, of three feet long,
up and down the room, lifting his legs
up very high, and setting them down very
hard. This pause gave time for Gluck
to collect his thoughts a little, and, seeing
no great reason to view his diminutive
visitor with dread, and feeling his curiosity
overcome his amazement, he ventured
on a question of peculiar delicacy.</p>

<p>"Pray, sir," said Gluck rather hesitatingly,
"were you my mug?"</p>

<p>On which the little man turned sharp
round, walked straight up to Gluck, and
drew himself up to his full height. "I,"
said the little man, "am the King of the
Golden River." Whereupon he turned
about again, and took two more turns,
some six feet long, in order to allow time
for the consternation which this announcement
produced in his auditor to
evaporate. After which, he again walked
up to Gluck and stood still, as if expecting
some comment on his communication.</p>

<p>Gluck determined to say something
at all events. "I hope your Majesty is
very well," said Gluck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen!" said the little man, deigning
no reply to this polite inquiry. "I
am the King of what you mortals call the
Golden River. The shape you saw me
in, was owing to the malice of a stronger
king, from whose enchantments you
have this instant freed me. What I
have seen of you, and your conduct to
your wicked brothers, renders me willing
to serve you; therefore, attend to what
I tell you. Whoever shall climb to the
top of that mountain from which you see
the Golden River issue, and shall cast
into the stream at its source three drops
of holy water, for him, and for him only,
the river shall turn to gold. But no one
failing in his first, can succeed in a second
attempt; and if any one shall cast unholy
water into the river, it will overwhelm
him, and he will become a black stone."
So saying, the King of the Golden River
turned away and deliberately walked into
the center of the hottest flame of the furnace.
His figure became red, white, transparent,
dazzling&mdash;a blaze of intense light&mdash;rose,
trembled, and disappeared. The
King of the Golden River had evaporated.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried poor Gluck, running to
look up the chimney after him; "Oh,
dear, dear, dear me! My mug! my
mug! my mug!"</p>


<div class='center'>CHAPTER III<br />
<br />
HOW MR. HANS SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION
TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW HE
PROSPERED THEREIN</div>

<p>The King of the Golden River had
hardly made the extraordinary exit, related
in the last chapter, before Hans
and Schwartz came roaring into the
house, very savagely drunk. The discovery
of the total loss of their last piece
of plate had the effect of sobering them
just enough to enable them to stand over
Gluck, beating him very steadily for a
quarter of an hour; at the expiration of
which period they dropped into a couple
of chairs, and requested to know what
he had got to say for himself. Gluck
told them his story, of which, of course,
they did not believe a word. They beat
him again, till their arms were tired, and
staggered to bed. In the morning, however,
the steadiness with which he adhered
to his story obtained him some
degree of credence; the immediate consequence
of which was, that the two
brothers, after wrangling a long time on
the knotty question, which of them should
try his fortune first, drew their swords
and began fighting. The noise of the
fray alarmed the neighbors, who, finding
they could not pacify the combatants,
sent for the constable.</p>

<p>Hans, on hearing this, contrived to
escape, and hid himself; but Schwartz
was taken before the magistrate, fined for
breaking the peace, and, having drunk
out his last penny the evening before,
was thrown into prison till he should pay.</p>

<p>When Hans heard this, he was much
delighted, and determined to set out immediately
for the Golden River. How
to get the holy water was the question.
He went to the priest, but the priest
could not give any holy water to so
abandoned a character. So Hans went
to vespers in the evening for the first
time in his life, and, under pretense of
crossing himself, stole a cupful, and returned
home in triumph.</p>

<p>Next morning he got up before the
sun rose, put the holy water into a strong
flask, and two bottles of wine and some
meat in a basket, slung them over his
back, took his alpine staff in his hand,
and set off for the mountains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>On his way out of the town he had to
pass the prison, and as he looked in at
the windows, whom should he see but
Schwartz himself peeping out of the bars,
and looking very disconsolate.</p>

<p>"Good morning, brother," said Hans;
"have you any message for the King of
the Golden River?"</p>

<p>Schwartz gnashed his teeth with rage,
and shook the bars with all his strength;
but Hans only laughed at him, and advising
him to make himself comfortable
till he came back again, shouldered his
basket, shook the bottle of holy water
in Schwartz's face till it frothed again,
and marched off in the highest spirits in
the world.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a morning that might
have made any one happy, even with no
Golden River to seek for. Level lines
of dewy mist lay stretched along the
valley, out of which rose the massy
mountains&mdash;their lower cliffs in pale
gray shadow, hardly distinguishable from
the floating vapor, but gradually ascending
till they caught the sunlight, which
ran in sharp touches of ruddy color along
the angular crags, and pierced, in long
level rays, through their fringes of spear-like
pine. Far above, shot up red
splintered masses of castellated rock,
jagged and shivered into myriads of fantastic
forms, with here and there a streak
of sunlit snow, traced down their chasms
like a line of forked lightning; and, far
beyond, and far above all these, fainter
than the morning cloud, but purer and
changeless, slept, in the blue sky, the
utmost peaks of the eternal snow.</p>

<p>The Golden River, which sprang from
one of the lower and snowless elevations,
was now nearly in shadow; all but the
uppermost jets of spray, which rose like
slow smoke above the undulating line of
the cataract, and floated away in feeble
wreaths upon the morning wind.</p>

<p>On this object, and on this alone,
Hans's eyes and thoughts were fixed;
forgetting the distance he had to traverse,
he set off at an imprudent rate of walking,
which greatly exhausted him before he
had scaled the first range of the green
and low hills. He was, moreover, surprised,
on surmounting them, to find
that a large glacier, of whose existence,
notwithstanding his previous knowledge
of the mountains, he had been absolutely
ignorant, lay between him and the source
of the Golden River. He entered on it
with the boldness of a practised mountaineer;
yet he thought he had never
traversed so strange or so dangerous a
glacier in his life. The ice was excessively
slippery, and out of all its
chasms came wild sounds of gushing
water; not monotonous or low, but
changeful and loud, rising occasionally
into drifting passages of wild melody;
then breaking off into short melancholy
tones, or sudden shrieks, resembling
those of human voices in distress or pain.
The ice was broken into thousands of
confused shapes, but none, Hans thought,
like the ordinary forms of splintered ice.
There seemed a curious <i>expression</i> about
all their outlines&mdash;a perpetual resemblance
to living features, distorted and
scornful. Myriads of deceitful shadows,
and lurid lights, played and floated about
and through the pale blue pinnacles,
dazzling and confusing the sight of the
traveler; while his ears grew dull and his
head giddy with the constant gush and
roar of the concealed waters. These
painful circumstances increased upon
him as he advanced; the ice crashed and
yawned into fresh chasms at his feet,
tottering spires nodded around him, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
fell thundering across his path; and
though he had repeatedly faced these
dangers on the most terrific glaciers, and
in the wildest weather, it was with a new
and oppressive feeling of panic terror
that he leaped the last chasm, and flung
himself, exhausted and shuddering, on
the firm turf of the mountain.</p>

<p>He had been compelled to abandon his
basket of food, which became a perilous
encumbrance on the glacier, and had now
no means of refreshing himself but by
breaking off and eating some of the pieces
of ice. This, however, relieved his thirst;
an hour's repose recruited his hardy
frame, and with the indomitable spirit of
avarice, he resumed his laborious journey.</p>

<p>His way now lay straight up a ridge
of bare red rocks, without a blade of
grass to ease the foot, or a projecting
angle to afford an inch of shade from the
south sun. It was past noon, and the
rays beat intensely upon the steep path,
while the whole atmosphere was motionless
and penetrated with heat. Intense
thirst was soon added to the bodily
fatigue with which Hans was now
afflicted; glance after glance he cast on
the flask of water which hung at his belt.
"Three drops are enough," at last thought
he; "I may, at least, cool my lips with it."</p>

<p>He opened the flask, and was raising it
to his lips, when his eye fell on an object
lying on the rock beside him; he thought
it moved. It was a small dog, apparently
in the last agony of death from thirst.
Its tongue was out, its jaws dry, its limbs
extended lifelessly, and a swarm of black
ants were crawling about its lips and
throat. Its eye moved to the bottle
which Hans held in his hand. He raised
it, drank, spurned the animal with his
foot, and passed on. And he did not
know how it was, but he thought that
a strange shadow had suddenly come
across the blue sky.</p>

<p>The path became steeper and more
rugged every moment; and the high hill
air, instead of refreshing him, seemed to
throw his blood into a fever. The noise
of the hill cataracts sounded like mockery
in his ears; they were all distant, and his
thirst increased every moment. Another
hour passed, and he again looked down
to the flask at his side; it was half empty,
but there was much more than three
drops in it. He stopped to open it; and
again, as he did so, something moved in
the path above him. It was a fair child,
stretched nearly lifeless on the rock, its
breast heaving with thirst, its eyes closed,
and its lips parched and burning. Hans
eyed it deliberately, drank, and passed on.
And a dark gray cloud came over the sun,
and long, snake-like shadows crept up
along the mountain sides. Hans struggled
on. The sun was sinking, but its descent
seemed to bring no coolness; the
leaden weight of the dead air pressed
upon his brow and heart, but the goal
was near. He saw the cataract of the
Golden River springing from the hillside,
scarcely five hundred feet above him.
He paused for a moment to breathe, and
sprang on to complete his task.</p>

<p>At this instant a faint cry fell on his
ear. He turned, and saw a gray-haired
old man extended on the rocks. His
eyes were sunk, his features deadly pale,
and gathered into an expression of
despair. "Water!" he stretched his
arms to Hans, and cried feebly, "Water!
I am dying."</p>

<p>"I have none," replied Hans; "thou
hast had thy share of life." He strode
over the prostrate body, and darted on.
And a flash of blue lightning rose out of
the East, shaped like a sword; it shook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
thrice over the whole heaven, and left
it dark with one heavy, impenetrable
shade. The sun was setting; it plunged
toward the horizon like a red-hot ball.</p>

<p>The roar of the Golden River rose on
Hans's ear. He stood at the brink of
the chasm through which it ran. Its
waves were filled with the red glory of
the sunset; they shook their crests like
tongues of fire, and flashes of bloody
light gleamed along their foam. Their
sound came mightier and mightier on his
senses; his brain grew giddy with the
prolonged thunder. Shuddering he drew
the flask from his girdle, and hurled it
into the center of the torrent. As he did
so, an icy chill shot through his limbs;
he staggered, shrieked, and fell. The
waters closed over his cry. And the
moaning of the river rose wildly into the
night, as it gushed over</p>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">The Black Stone</span>.</div>


<div class='center'><br />CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
HOW MR. SCHWARTZ SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION
TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW HE
PROSPERED THEREIN</div>

<p>Poor little Gluck waited very anxiously
alone in the house for Hans's return.
Finding he did not come back, he was
terribly frightened and went and told
Schwartz in the prison, all that had
happened. Then Schwartz was very
much pleased, and said that Hans must
certainly have been turned into a black
stone, and he should have all the gold to
himself. But Gluck was very sorry, and
cried all night. When he got up in the
morning there was no bread in the house,
nor any money; so Gluck went and hired
himself to another goldsmith, and he
worked so hard, and so neatly, and so
long every day, that he soon got money
enough together to pay his brother's
fine, and he went and gave it all to
Schwartz, and Schwartz got out of prison.
Then Schwartz was quite pleased, and
said he should have some of the gold of the
river. But Gluck only begged he would
go and see what had become of Hans.</p>

<p>Now when Schwartz had heard that
Hans had stolen the holy water, he
thought to himself that such a proceeding
might not be considered altogether
correct by the King of the Golden
River, and determined to manage matters
better. So he took some more of Gluck's
money, and went to a bad priest, who
gave him some holy water very readily
for it. Then Schwartz was sure it was
all quite right. So Schwartz got up early
in the morning before the sun rose, and
took some bread and wine, in a basket,
and put his holy water in a flask, and set
off for the mountains. Like his brother,
he was much surprised at the sight of
the glacier, and had great difficulty in
crossing it, even after leaving his basket
behind him. The day was cloudless, but
not bright; there was a heavy purple
haze hanging over the sky, and the hills
looked lowering and gloomy. And as
Schwartz climbed the steep rock path,
the thirst came upon him, as it had upon
his brother, until he lifted his flask to
his lips to drink. Then he saw the fair
child lying near him on the rocks, and
it cried to him, and moaned for water.</p>

<p>"Water, indeed," said Schwartz; "I
haven't half enough for myself," and
passed on. And as he went he thought
the sunbeams grew more dim, and he
saw a low bank of black cloud rising out
of the West; and, when he had climbed
for another hour the thirst overcame
him again, and he would have drunk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Then he saw the old man lying before
him on the path, and heard him cry
out for water. "Water, indeed," said
Schwartz, "I haven't enough for myself,"
and on he went.</p>

<p>Then again the light seemed to fade
before his eyes, and he looked up, and,
behold, a mist, of the color of blood, had
come over the sun; and the bank of black
cloud had risen very high, and its edges
were tossing and tumbling like the waves
of the angry sea. And they cast long shadows,
which flickered over Schwartz's path.</p>

<p>Then Schwartz climbed for another
hour, and again his thirst returned; and
as he lifted his flask to his lips, he thought
he saw his brother Hans lying exhausted
on the path before him, and, as he gazed,
the figure stretched its arms to him, and
cried for water. "Ha, ha," laughed
Schwartz, "are you there? Remember the
prison bars, my boy. Water, indeed! do
you suppose I carried it all the way up
here for <i>you?</i>" And he strode over the
figure; yet, as he passed, he thought he
saw a strange expression of mockery
about its lips. And, when he had gone
a few yards farther, he looked back; but
the figure was not there.</p>

<p>And a sudden horror came over
Schwartz, he knew not why; but the
thirst for gold prevailed over his fear,
and he rushed on. And the bank of
black cloud rose to the zenith, and out
of it came bursts of spiry lightning, and
waves of darkness seemed to heave and
float between their flashes over the whole
heavens. And the sky where the sun
was setting was all level, and like a lake
of blood; and a strong wind came out of
that sky, tearing its crimson cloud into
fragments, and scattering them far into
the darkness. And when Schwartz stood
by the brink of the Golden River, its
waves were black, like thunder clouds,
but their foam was like fire; and the
roar of the waters below, and the thunder
above, met, as he cast the flask into the
stream. And, as he did so, the lightning
glared into his eyes, and the earth gave
way beneath him, and the waters closed
over his cry. And the moaning of the
river rose wildly into the night, as it
gushed over the</p>

<div class='center'><br />CHAPTER V<br />
<br />
HOW LITTLE GLUCK SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION
TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW HE
PROSPERED THEREIN; WITH OTHER
MATTERS OF INTEREST</div>

<p>When Gluck found that Schwartz did
not come back he was very sorry, and
did not know what to do. He had no
money, and was obliged to go and hire
himself again to the goldsmith, who
worked him very hard, and gave him very
little money. So, after a month or two,
Gluck grew tired, and made up his mind
to go and try his fortune with the Golden
River. "The little King looked very
kind," thought he. "I don't think he
will turn me into a black stone." So he
went to the priest, and the priest gave
him some holy water as soon as he asked
for it. Then Gluck took some bread in
his basket, and the bottle of water, and
set off very early for the mountains.</p>

<p>If the glacier had occasioned a great
deal of fatigue to his brothers, it was
twenty times worse for him, who was
neither so strong nor so practised on the
mountains. He had several bad falls,
lost his basket and bread, and was very
much frightened at the strange noises
under the ice. He lay a long time to
rest on the grass, after he had got over,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and began to climb the hill just in the
hottest part of the day. When he had
climbed for an hour, he got dreadfully
thirsty, and was going to drink like his
brothers, when he saw an old man coming
down the path above him, looking very
feeble, and leaning on a staff. "My son,"
said the old man, "I am faint with thirst.
Give me some of that water." Then
Gluck looked at him, and when he saw
that he was pale and weary, he gave him
the water; "Only pray don't drink it all,"
said Gluck. But the old man drank a
great deal, and gave him back the bottle
two-thirds empty. Then he bade him
good speed, and Gluck went on again
merrily. And the path became easier
to his feet, and two or three blades of
grass appeared upon it, and some grasshoppers
began singing on the bank beside
it; and Gluck thought he had never
heard such merry singing.</p>

<p>Then he went on for another hour, and
the thirst increased on him so that he
thought he should be forced to drink.
But, as he raised the flask, he saw a
little child lying panting by the road-side,
and it cried out piteously for water.
Then Gluck struggled with himself, and
determined to bear the thirst a little
longer; and he put the bottle to the child's
lips, and it drank it all but a few drops.
Then it smiled on him, and got up and
ran down the hill; and Gluck looked
after it, till it became as small as a little
star, and then turned and began climbing
again. And then there were all kinds of
sweet flowers growing on the rocks, bright
green moss with pale pink starry flowers,
and soft belled gentians, more blue than
the sky at its deepest, and pure white
transparent lilies. And crimson and
purple butterflies darted hither and
thither, and the sky sent down such pure
light that Gluck had never felt so happy
in his life.</p>

<p>Yet, when he had climbed for another
hour, his thirst became intolerable again;
and, when he looked at his bottle, he
saw that there were only five or six drops
left in it, and he could not venture to
drink. And, as he was hanging the flask
to his belt again, he saw a little dog lying
on the rocks, gasping for breath&mdash;just
as Hans had seen it on the day of his
ascent. And Gluck stopped and looked
at it, and then at the Golden River, not
five hundred yards above him; and he
thought of the dwarf's words, "that no
one could succeed, except in his first
attempt"; and he tried to pass the dog,
but it whined piteously, and Gluck
stopped again. "Poor beastie," said
Gluck, "it'll be dead when I come down
again, if I don't help it." Then he
looked closer and closer at it, and its
eye turned on him so mournfully that
he could not stand it. "Confound the
King and his gold, too," said Gluck; and
he opened the flask, and poured all the
water into the dog's mouth.</p>

<p>The dog sprang up and stood on its
hind legs. Its tail disappeared, its ears
became long, longer, silky, golden; its nose
became very red, its eyes became very
twinkling; in three seconds the dog was
gone, and before Gluck stood his old acquaintance,
the King of the Golden River.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the monarch; "but
don't be frightened, it's all right"; for
Gluck showed manifest symptoms of
consternation at this unlooked-for reply
to his last observation. "Why didn't
you come before," continued the dwarf,
"instead of sending me those rascally
brothers of yours, for me to have the
trouble of turning into stones? Very
hard stones they make, too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" said Gluck, "have you
really been so cruel?"</p>

<p>"Cruel!" said the dwarf: "they poured
unholy water into my stream; do you
suppose I'm going to allow that?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Gluck, "I am sure, sir&mdash;your
Majesty, I mean,&mdash;they got the
water out of the church font."</p>

<p>"Very probably," replied the dwarf;
"but," and his countenance grew stern as
he spoke, "the water which has been
refused to the cry of the weary and dying
is unholy, though it had been blessed by
every saint in heaven; and the water
which is found in the vessel of mercy is
holy, though it had been defiled with
corpses."</p>

<p>So saying, the dwarf stooped and
plucked a lily that grew at his feet. On
its white leaves there hung three drops
of clear dew. And the dwarf shook
them into the flask which Gluck held in
his hand. "Cast these into the river,"
he said, "and descend on the other side
of the mountains into the Treasure
Valley, and so good speed."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the figure of the dwarf
became indistinct. The playing colors
of his robe formed themselves into a
prismatic mist of dewy light: he stood
for an instant veiled with them as with
the belt of a broad rainbow. The colors
grew faint, the mist rose into the air;
the monarch had evaporated.</p>

<p>And Gluck climbed to the brink of
the Golden River and its waves were
as clear as crystal, and as brilliant as
the sun. And, when he cast the three
drops of dew into the stream, there
opened where they fell, a small circular
whirlpool, into which the waters descended
with a musical noise.</p>

<p>Gluck stood watching it for some time,
very much disappointed, because not
only the river was not turned into gold
but its waters seemed much diminished
in quantity. Yet he obeyed his friend
the dwarf, and descended the other side
of the mountains, towards the Treasure
Valley; and, as he went, he thought he
heard the noise of water working its way
under the ground. And when he came in
sight of the Treasure Valley, behold, a
river, like the Golden River, was springing
from a new cleft of the rocks above it,
and was flowing in innumerable streams
among the dry heaps of red sand.</p>

<p>And, as Gluck gazed, fresh grass
sprang beside the new streams, and
creeping plants grew, and climbed among
the moistening soil. Young flowers
opened suddenly along the river sides,
as stars leap out when twilight is deepening,
and thickets of myrtle, and tendrils
of vine, cast lengthening shadows over
the valley as they grew. And thus the
Treasure Valley became a garden again,
and the inheritance, which had been
lost by cruelty, was regained by love.</p>

<p>And Gluck went and dwelt in the valley,
and the poor were never driven from
his door; so that his barns became full of
corn, and his house of treasure. And
for him, the river had, according to the
dwarf's promise, become a River of Gold.</p>

<p>And, to this day, the inhabitants of
the valley point out the place where the
three drops of holy dew were cast into
the stream, and trace the course of the
Golden River under the ground, until
it emerges in the Treasure Valley. And
at the top of the cataract of the Golden
River are still to be seen <span class="smcap">two black
stones</span>, round which the waters howl
mournfully every day at sunset; and
these stones are still called by the people
of the valley</p>

<h3><br />SUGGESTIONS FOR READING</h3>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>It is possible to piece out a very satisfactory account of the nature and history of the traditional
fable by looking up in any good encyclopedia the brief articles under the following heads:
Folklore, Fable, Parable, Apologue, &AElig;sop, Demetrius of Phalerum, Babrias, Phaedrus, Avian,
Romulus, Maximus Planudes, Jataka, Bidpai, Panchatantra, Hitopadesa.</p>

<h2>SECTION V: FABLES AND SYMBOLIC STORIES</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>

<p><i>The character and value of fables.</i> Some one has pointed out that there are two
kinds of ideals by which we are guided in life and that these ideals may be compared
to lighthouses and lanterns. By means of the lighthouse, remote and lofty, we are
able to lay a course and to know at any time whether we are headed in the right
direction. But while we are moving along a difficult road we need more immediate
illumination to avoid the mudholes and stumbling-places close at hand. We need
the humble lantern to show us where we may safely step.</p>

<p>Fables are lanterns by which our feet are guided. They embody the practical
rules for everyday uses, rules of prudence that have been tested and approved by untold
generations of travelers along the arduous road of life. They chart only minor dangers
and difficult places as a rule, but these are the ones with which we are always in
direct contact. Being honest because it is the "best policy" is not the highest
reason for honesty, but it is what a practical world has found to be best in practice.
Fables simply give us the "rules of the road," and these rules contribute greatly to
our convenience and safety. Such rules are the result of the common sense of man
working upon his everyday problems. To violate one of these practical rules is to
be a blunderer, and blundering is a subject for jest rather than bitter denouncement.
Hence the humorous and satirical note in fables.</p>

<p>The practical, self-made men of the world, who have done things and inspired
others to do them, have always placed great emphasis upon common-sense ideals.
Benjamin Franklin, by his <i>Poor Richard's Almanac</i>, kept the incentives to industry and
thrift before a people who needed to practice these everyday rules if they were to
conquer an unwilling wilderness. So well did he do his work that after nearly two
hundred years we are still quoting his pithy sayings. It may be that his proverbs
were all borrowed, but the rules of the road are not matters for constant experiment.
Again, no account of Abraham Lincoln can omit his use of &AElig;sop or of &AElig;sop-like stories
to enforce his ideas. His homely stories were so "pat" that there was nothing left
for the opposition to say. Only one who grasps the heart of a problem can use concrete
illustrations with such effect.</p>

<p>No one really questions the truths enforced by the more familiar fables. But
since these teachings are so commonplace and obvious, they cannot be impressed
upon us by mere repetition of the teachings as such. To secure the emphasis needed
the world gradually evolved a body of striking stories and proverbs by which the
standing rules of everyday life are displayed in terms that cling like burrs. "The
peculiar value of the fable," says Dr. Adler, "is that they are instantaneous photographs,
which reproduce, as it were, in a single flash of light, some one aspect of human
nature, and which, excluding everything else, permit the entire attention to be fixed
on that one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p><i>&AElig;sop and Bidpai.</i> The type of fable in mind in the above account is that
known as the &AElig;sopic, a brief beast-story in which the characters are, as a rule, conventionalized
animals, and which points out some practical moral. The fox may
represent crafty people, the ass may represent stupid people, the wind may represent
boisterous people, the tortoise may represent plodding people who "keep everlastingly
at it." When human beings are introduced, such as the Shepherd Boy, or
Androcles, or the Travelers, or the Milkmaid, they are as wholly conventionalized
as the animals and there is never any doubt as to their motives. &AElig;sop, if he ever
existed at all, is said to have been a Greek slave of the sixth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, very
ugly and clever, who used fables orally for political purposes and succeeded in gaining
his freedom and a high position. Later writers, among them Demetrius of
Phalerum about 300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> and Phaedrus about 30 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, made versions of fables
ascribed to &AElig;sop. Many writers in the Middle Ages brought together increasing
numbers of fables under &AElig;sop's name and enlarged upon the few traditional facts
in Herodotus about &AElig;sop himself until several hundred fables and an elaborate
biography of the supposed author were in existence. Joseph Jacobs said he had
counted as many as 700 different fables going under &AElig;sop's name. The number
included in a present-day book of &AElig;sop usually varies from 200 to 350. Another
name associated with the making of fables is that of Bidpai (or Pilpay), said to have
been a philosopher attached to the court of some oriental king. Bidpai, a name
which means "head scholar," is a more shadowy figure even than &AElig;sop. What we
can be sure of is that there were two centers, Greece and India, from which fables
were diffused. Whether they all came originally from a single source, and, if so,
what that source was, are questions still debated by scholars.</p>

<p><i>Modern fabulists.</i> Modern fables are no more possible than a new Mother
Goose or a new fairy story. For modern times the method of the fable is "at once
too simple and too roundabout. Too roundabout; for the truths we have to tell
we prefer to speak out directly and not by way of allegory. And the truths the
fable has to teach are too simple to correspond to the facts in our complex civilization."
No modern fabulist has duplicated in his field the success of Hans Christian Andersen
in the field of the nursery story. A few fables from La Fontaine, a few from Krylov,
one or two each from Gay, Cowper, Yriarte, and Lessing may be used to good advantage
with children. The general broadening of literary variety has, of course, given
us in recent times many valuable stories of the symbolistic kind. Suggestive parable-like
or allegorical stories, such as a few of Hawthorne's in <i>Twice Told Tales</i> and <i>Mosses
from an Old Manse</i>, or a few of Tolstoy's short tales, are simple enough for children.</p>

<p><i>The use of fables in school.</i> Not all fables are good for educational purposes.
There is, however, plenty of room for choice, and those that present points of view no
longer accepted by the modern world should be eliminated from the list. Objections
based on the unreality of the fables, their "unnatural natural history," are hardly
valid. Rousseau's elimination of fables from his scheme of education in <i>Emile</i> is
based on this objection and on the further point that the child will often sympathize
with the wrong character in the story, thus going astray in the moral lesson. Other
objectors down to the present day simply echo Rousseau. Such a view does little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
justice to the child's natural sense of values. He is certain to see that the Frog
is foolish in competing with the Ox in size, and certain to recognize the common sense
of the Country Mouse. He will no more be deceived by a fable than he will by the
painted clown in a circus.</p>

<p>The oral method of presentation is the ideal one. Tell the story in as vivid a
form as possible. In the earlier grades the interest in the story may be a sufficient
end, but almost from the beginning children will see the lesson intended. They will
catch the phrases that have come from fables into our everyday speech. Thus,
"sour grapes," "dog in the manger," "to blow hot and cold," "to kill the goose that
lays the golden eggs," "to cry 'Wolf!'" will take on more significant meanings. If
some familiar proverb goes hand in hand with the story, it will help the point to take
fast hold in the mind. Applications of the fable to real events should be encouraged.
That is what fables were made for and that is where their chief value for us is still
manifest. Only a short time need be spent on any one fable, but every opportunity
should be taken to call up and apply the fables already learned. For they are not
merely for passing amusement, nor is their value confined to childhood. Listen to
John Locke, one of the "hardest-headed" of philosophers: "As soon as a child has
learned to read, it is desirable to place in his hands pleasant books, suited to his
capacity, wherein the entertainment that he finds might draw him on, and reward
his pains in reading; and yet not such as should fill his head with perfectly useless
trumpery, or lay the principles of vice and folly. To this purpose I think <i>&AElig;sop's
Fables</i> the best, which being stories apt to delight and entertain a child, may yet
afford useful reflections to a grown man, and if his memory retain them all his life
after, he will not repent to find them there, amongst his manly thoughts and serious
business."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span><br /><br /></p>

<div class="hang1">The best &AElig;sop collection for teachers and
pupils alike is <i>The Fables of &AElig;sop</i>, edited
by Joseph Jacobs. It contains eighty-two
selected fables, including those that are
most familiar and most valuable for children.
The versions are standards of what
such retellings should be, and may well
serve as models for teachers in their presentation
of other short symbolic stories.
The introduction, "A Short History of the
&AElig;sopic Fable," and the notes at the end
of the book contain, in concise form, all
the practical information needed. The
text of the Jacobs versions was the one
selected for reproduction in Dr. Eliot's
<i>Harvard Classics</i>. Nos. <a href="#Note_205">205</a>, <a href="#Note_206">206</a>, <a href="#Note_207">207</a>, <a href="#Note_208">208</a>,
<a href="#Note_209">209</a>, <a href="#Note_213">213</a>,  and <a href="#Note_233">233</a> in the following group
are by Mr. Jacobs. The other &AElig;sopic
fables given are from various collections of
the traditional versions. Almost any of the
many reprints called &AElig;sop are satisfactory
for fables not found in Jacobs. Perhaps
the one most common in recent times is
that made by Thomas James in 1848,
which had the good fortune to be illustrated
by Tenniel. The versions are brief
and not overloaded with editorial "filling."</div>

<h4><br />THE SHEPHERD'S BOY</h4>

<p>There was once a young Shepherd Boy
who tended his sheep at the foot of a
mountain near a dark forest. It was
rather lonely for him all day, so he
thought upon a plan by which he could
get a little company and some excitement.
He rushed down towards the village calling
out "Wolf! Wolf!" and the villagers
came out to meet him, and some of them
stopped with him for a considerable
time. This pleased the boy so much
that a few days afterwards he tried the
same trick, and again the villagers came
to his help. But shortly after this a
Wolf actually did come out from the
forest, and began to worry the sheep,
and the boy of course cried out "Wolf!
Wolf!" still louder than before. But
this time the villagers, who had been
fooled twice before, thought the boy was
again deceiving them, and nobody stirred
to come to his help. So the Wolf made
a good meal off the boy's flock, and when
the boy complained, the wise man of the
village said:</p>

<p>"<i>A liar will not be believed, even when he
speaks the truth.</i>"</p>

<h4><br />THE LION AND THE MOUSE</h4>

<p>Once when a Lion was asleep a little
Mouse began running up and down upon
him; this soon wakened the Lion, who
placed his huge paw upon him and
opened his big jaws to swallow him.
"Pardon, O King," cried the little
Mouse; "forgive me this time; I shall
never forget it. Who knows but what I
may be able to do you a good turn some
of these days?" The Lion was so tickled
at the idea of the Mouse being able to
help him, that he lifted up his paw and
let him go. Some time after the Lion
was caught in a trap, and the hunters,
who desired to carry him alive to the
King, tied him to a tree while they went
in search of a wagon to carry him on.
Just then the little Mouse happened to
pass by, and seeing the sad plight in
which the Lion was, went up to him
and soon gnawed away the ropes that
bound the King of the Beasts. "Was
I not right?" said the little Mouse.</p>

<p><i>Little friends may prove great friends.</i></p>

<h4><br />THE CROW AND THE
PITCHER</h4>

<p>A Crow, half-dead with thirst, came
upon a Pitcher which had once been full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of water; but when the Crow put its
beak into the mouth of the Pitcher he
found that only very little water was
left in it, and that he could not reach
far enough down to get at it. He tried
and he tried, but at last had to give up
in despair. Then a thought came to
him, and he took a pebble and dropped
it into the Pitcher. Then he took
another pebble and dropped it into the
Pitcher. Then he took another pebble
and dropped that into the Pitcher.
Then he took another pebble and dropped
that into the Pitcher. Then he took
another pebble and dropped that into
the Pitcher. Then he took another
pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher.
At last, at last, he saw the water mount
up near him; and after casting in a few
more pebbles he was able to quench his
thirst and save his life.</p>

<p><i>Little by little does the trick.</i></p>

<h4><br />THE FROG AND THE OX</h4>

<p>"Oh, Father," said a little Frog to the
big one sitting by the side of a pool,
"I have seen such a terrible monster!
It was as big as a mountain, with horns
on its head, and a long tail, and it had
hoofs divided in two."</p>

<p>"Tush, child, tush," said the old
Frog, "that was only Farmer White's
Ox. It isn't so big either; he may be
a little bit taller than I, but I could
easily make myself quite as broad; just
you see." So he blew himself out, and
blew himself out, and blew himself out.
"Was he as big as that?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Oh, much bigger than that," said
the young Frog.</p>

<p>Again the old one blew himself out,
and asked the young one if the Ox was
as big as that.</p>

<p>"Bigger, Father, bigger," was the reply.</p>

<p>So the Frog took a deep breath, and
blew and blew and blew, and swelled
and swelled and swelled. And then he
said: "I'm sure the Ox is not as big
as&mdash;" But at this moment he burst.</p>

<p><i>Self-conceit may lead to self-destruction.</i></p>

<h4><br />THE FROGS DESIRING
A KING</h4>

<p>Frogs were living as happy as could
be in a marshy swamp that just suited
them; they went splashing about, caring
for nobody and nobody troubling with
them. But some of them thought that
this was not right, that they should have
a king and a proper constitution, so
they determined to send up a petition
to Jove to give them what they wanted.
"Mighty Jove," they cried, "send unto
us a king that will rule over us and keep
us in order." Jove laughed at their
croaking, and threw down into the
swamp a huge Log, which came down&mdash;kersplash&mdash;into
the water. The Frogs
were frightened out of their lives by the
commotion made in their midst, and all
rushed to the bank to look at the horrible
monster; but after a time, seeing
that it did not move, one or two of the
boldest of them ventured out towards
the Log, and even dared to touch it;
still it did not move. Then the greatest
hero of the Frogs jumped upon the Log
and commenced dancing up and down
upon it; thereupon all the Frogs came
and did the same; and for some time
the Frogs went about their business every
day without taking the slightest notice
of their new King Log lying in their
midst. But this did not suit them, so
they sent another petition to Jove, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
said to him: "We want a real king; one
that will really rule over us." Now this
made Jove angry, so he sent among them
a big Stork that soon set to work gobbling
them all up. Then the Frogs repented
when too late.</p>

<p><i>Better no rule than cruel rule.</i></p>

<div class="hang1">The following fable is found in the folklore
of many countries. Its lesson of consolation
for those who are not blessed with
abundance of worldly goods may account
for its widespread popularity. Independence
and freedom from fear have advantages

<h4><br />THE FIELD MOUSE AND
THE TOWN MOUSE</h4>

<p>A Field Mouse had a friend who lived
in a house in town. Now the Town
Mouse was asked by the Field Mouse
to dine with him, and out he went and
sat down to a meal of corn and wheat.</p>

<p>"Do you know, my friend," said he,
"that you live a mere ant's life out here?
Why, I have all kinds of things at home.
Come, and enjoy them."</p>

<p>So the two set off for town, and there
the Town Mouse showed his beans and
meal, his dates, too, and his cheese and
fruit and honey. And as the Field Mouse
ate, drank, and was merry, he thought
how rich his friend was, and how poor
he was.</p>

<p>But as they ate, a man all at once
opened the door, and the Mice were in
such a fear that they ran into a crack.</p>

<p>Then, when they would eat some nice
figs, in came a maid to get a pot of honey
or a bit of cheese; and when they saw
her, they hid in a hole.</p>

<p>Then the Field Mouse would eat no
more, but said to the Town Mouse,
"Do as you like, my good friend; eat
all you want and have your fill of good
things, but you will be always in fear of
your life. As for me, poor Mouse, who
have only corn and wheat, I will live
on at home in no fear of any one."</p>

<h3><br /><a name="Note_212" id="Note_212">212</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The most famous use of this fable in literature
is found in the <i>Satires</i> of the great Roman
poet, Horace (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 65-8). He is regarded
as one of the most polished of writers,
and the ancient world's most truthful
painter of social life and manners. Horace
had a country seat among the Sabine hills
to which he could retire from the worries
and distractions of the world. His delight
in his Sabine farm is shown clearly in his
handling of the story. The passage is a
part of Book II, Satire 6, and is in Conington's
translation. Some well-known
appearances of this same fable in English
poetry may be found in Prior and Montagu's
<i>City Mouse and Country Mouse</i> and in
Pope's <i>Imitations of Horace</i>.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />THE COUNTRY MOUSE AND
THE TOWN MOUSE</h4>

<div class='center'>HORACE<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
One day a country mouse in his poor home<br />
Received an ancient friend, a mouse from Rome.<br />
The host, though close and careful, to a guest<br />
Could open still; so now he did his best.<br />
He spares not oats or vetches; in his chaps<br />
Raisins he brings, and nibbled bacon-scraps,<br />
Hoping by varied dainties to entice<br />
His town-bred guest, so delicate and nice.<br />
Who condescended graciously to touch<br />
Thing after thing, but never would take much,<br />
While he, the owner of the mansion, sate<br />
On threshed-out straw, and spelt and darnels ate.<br />
At length the town mouse cries, "I wonder how<br />
You can live here, friend, on this hill's rough brow!<br />
Take my advice, and leave these ups and downs,<br />
This hill and dale, for humankind and towns.<br />
Come, now, go home with me; remember, all<br />
Who live on earth are mortal, great and small.<br />
Then take, good sir, your pleasure while you may;<br />
With life so short, 'twere wrong to lose a day."<br />
This reasoning made the rustic's head turn round;<br />
Forth from his hole he issues with a bound,<br />
And they two make together for their mark,<br />
In hopes to reach the city during dark.<br />
The midnight sky was bending over all,<br />
When they set foot within a stately hall,<br />
Where couches of wrought ivory had been spread<br />
With gorgeous coverlets of Tyrian red,<br />
And viands piled up high in baskets lay,<br />
The relics of a feast of yesterday.<br />
The town mouse does the honors, lays his guest<br />
At ease upon a couch with crimson dressed,<br />
Then nimbly moves in character of host,<br />
And offers in succession boiled and roast;<br />
Nay, like a well-trained slave, each wish prevents,<br />
And tastes before the titbits he presents.<br />
The guest, rejoicing in his altered fare,<br />
Assumes in turn a genial diner's air,<br />
When, hark, a sudden banging of the door!<br />
Each from his couch is tumbled on the floor.<br />
Half dead, they scurry round the room, poor things,<br />
While the whole house with barking mastiffs rings.<br />
Then says the rustic, "It may do for you,<br />
This life, but I don't like it; so, adieu.<br />
Give me my hole, secure from all alarms;<br />
I'll prove that tares and vetches still have charms."<br />

but finding that the Lion did not pursue
him, he turned back and went up to
him. As he came near, the Lion put
out his paw, which was all swollen and
bleeding, and Androcles found that a
huge thorn had got into it, and was
causing all the pain. He pulled out the
thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion,
who was soon able to rise and lick the
hand of Androcles like a dog. Then the
Lion took Androcles to his cave, and
every day used to bring him meat from
which to live. But shortly afterwards
both Androcles and the Lion were captured,
and the slave was sentenced to
be thrown to the Lion, after the latter
had been kept without food for several
days. The Emperor and all his Court
came to see the spectacle, and Androcles
was led out into the middle of the arena.
Soon the Lion was let loose from his den,
and rushed bounding and roaring towards
his victim. But as soon as he came near
to Androcles he recognized his friend, and
fawned upon him, and licked his hands
like a friendly dog. The Emperor, surprised
at this, summoned Androcles to
him, who told him the whole story.
Whereupon the slave was pardoned and
freed, and the Lion let loose to his
native forest.</p>

<div class="hang1">The preceding fable is here given in the form
used in Thomas Day's very famous, but
probably little read, <i>History of Sandford
and Merton</i>. (See No. <a href="#Note_380">380</a>.) Day's use
of the story is probably responsible for its
modern popularity. Jacobs points out
that it dropped out of &AElig;sop, although it
was in some of the medieval fable books.
A very similar tale, "Of the Remembrance
of Benefits," is in the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>
(Tale 104). The most striking use of the
fable in modern literature is in George
Bernard Shaw's play <i>Androcles</i>. It will
be instructive to compare the force of
Day's rather heavy and slow telling of
the story with that of the concise, unelaborated
version by Jacobs.</div>


<h4><br />ANDROCLES AND THE LION</h4>

<div class='center'>THOMAS DAY</div>

<p>There was a certain slave named
Androcles, who was so ill-treated by his
master that his life became insupportable.
Finding no remedy for what he suffered,
he at length said to himself, "It is
better to die than to continue to live
in such hardships and misery as I am
obliged to suffer. I am determined therefore
to run away from my master. If I
am taken again, I know that I shall be
punished with a cruel death; but it is
better to die at once than to live in
misery. If I escape, I must betake myself
to deserts and woods, inhabited only
by wild beasts; but they cannot use me
more cruelly than I have been used by
my fellow-creatures. Therefore I will
rather trust myself with them than continue
to be a miserable slave."</p>

<p>Having formed this resolution, he took
an opportunity of leaving his master's
house, and hid himself in a thick forest,
which was at some miles' distance from
the city. But here the unhappy man
found that he had only escaped from one
kind of misery to experience another.
He wandered about all day through a
vast and trackless wood, where his flesh
was continually torn by thorns and
brambles. He grew hungry, but could
find no food in this dreary solitude.
At length he was ready to die with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
fatigue, and lay down in despair in a large
cavern which he found by accident.</p>

<p>This unfortunate man had not lain
long quiet in the cavern, before he heard
a dreadful noise, which seemed to be the
roar of some wild beast, and terrified
him very much. He started up with a
design to escape and had already reached
the mouth of the cave when he saw
coming towards him a lion of prodigious
size, who prevented any possibility
of retreat. The unfortunate man then
believed his destruction to be inevitable;
but, to his great astonishment, the beast
advanced towards him with a gentle pace,
without any mark of enmity or rage, and
uttered a kind of mournful voice, as if
he demanded the assistance of the man.</p>

<p>Androcles, who was naturally of a
resolute disposition, acquired courage
from this circumstance, to examine his
monstrous guest, who gave him sufficient
leisure for that purpose. He saw, as the
lion approached him, that he seemed to
limp upon one of his legs and that the
foot was extremely swelled as if it had
been wounded. Acquiring still more fortitude
from the gentle demeanor of the
beast, he advanced up to him and took
hold of the wounded paw, as a surgeon
would examine a patient. He then perceived
that a thorn of uncommon size
had penetrated the ball of the foot and
was the occasion of the swelling and
lameness he had observed. Androcles
found that the beast, far from resenting
this familiarity, received it with the
greatest gentleness and seemed to invite
him by his blandishments to proceed.
He therefore extracted the thorn, and,
pressing the swelling, discharged a considerable
quantity of matter, which had
been the cause of so much pain and
uneasiness.</p>

<p>As soon as the beast felt himself thus
relieved, he began to testify his joy and
gratitude by every expression within his
power. He jumped about like a wanton
spaniel, wagged his enormous tail, and
licked the feet and hands of his physician.
Nor was he contented with these demonstrations
of kindness; from this moment
Androcles became his guest; nor did the
lion ever sally forth in quest of prey without
bringing home the produce of his
chase and sharing it with his friend. In
this savage state of hospitality did the
man continue to live during the space of
several months. At length, wandering
unguardedly through the woods, he met
with a company of soldiers sent out to
apprehend him, and was by them taken
prisoner and conducted back to his master.
The laws of that country being very
severe against slaves, he was tried and
found guilty of having fled from his master,
and, as a punishment for his pretended
crime, he was sentenced to be
torn in pieces by a furious lion, kept
many days without food to inspire him
with additional rage.</p>

<p>When the destined moment arrived,
the unhappy man was exposed, unarmed,
in the midst of a spacious area, enclosed
on every side, round which many thousand
people were assembled to view the
mournful spectacle.</p>

<p>Presently a dreadful yell was heard,
which struck the spectators with horror;
and a monstrous lion rushed out of a den,
which was purposely set open, and darted
forward with erected mane, and flaming
eyes, and jaws that gaped like an open
sepulchre.&mdash;A mournful silence instantly
prevailed! All eyes were turned upon
the destined victim, whose destruction
now appeared inevitable. But the pity
of the multitude was soon converted into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
astonishment, when they beheld the lion,
instead of destroying his defenceless prey,
crouch submissively at his feet; fawn
upon him as a faithful dog would do
upon his master, and rejoice over him
as a mother that unexpectedly recovers
her offspring. The governor of the town,
who was present, then called out with a
loud voice and ordered Androcles to
explain to them this unintelligible mystery,
and how a savage beast of the
fiercest and most unpitying nature should
thus in a moment have forgotten his
innate disposition, and be converted into
a harmless and inoffensive animal.</p>

<p>Androcles then related to the assembly
every circumstance of his adventures in
the woods, and concluded by saying that
the very lion which now stood before them
had been his friend and entertainer in
the woods. All the persons present were
astonished and delighted with the story,
to find that even the fiercest beasts are
capable of being softened by gratitude and
moved by humanity; and they unanimously
joined to entreat for the pardon of
the unhappy man from the governor of
the place. This was immediately granted
to him, and he was also presented with
the lion, who had in this manner twice
saved the life of Androcles.</p>

<h4><br />THE WIND AND THE SUN</h4>

<p>A dispute once arose between the North
Wind and the Sun as to which was the
stronger of the two. Seeing a Traveler
on his way, they agreed to try which
could the sooner get his cloak off him.
The North Wind began, and sent a
furious blast, which, at the onset,
nearly tore the cloak from its fastenings;
but the Traveler, seizing the
garment with a firm grip, held it round
his body so tightly that Boreas spent
his remaining force in vain.</p>

<p>The Sun, dispelling the clouds that had
gathered, then darted his genial beams
on the Traveler's head. Growing faint
with the heat, the Man flung off his coat
and ran for protection to the nearest
shade.</p>

<div class="hang1">The following brief fable has given us one
of the best known expressions in common
speech, "killing the goose that lays the
golden eggs." People who never heard of
&AElig;sop know what that expression means.
It is easy to connect the fable with our
"get rich quick" craze. (Compare with
No. <a href="#Note_254">254</a>.)</div>


<h4><br />THE GOOSE WITH THE
GOLDEN EGGS</h4>

<p>A certain Man had a Goose that laid
him a golden egg every day. Being of
a covetous turn, he thought if he killed
his Goose he should come at once to the
source of his treasure. So he killed her
and cut her open, but great was his dismay
to find that her inside was in no
way different from that of any other

<div class="hang1">The most successful of modern literary fabulists
was the French poet Jean de la Fontaine
(1621-1695). A famous critic has
said that his fables delight the child with
their freshness and vividness, the student
of literature with their consummate art, and
the experienced man with their subtle reflections
on life and character. He drew
most of his stories from &AElig;sop and other
sources. While he dressed the old fables in
the brilliant style of his own day, he still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
succeeded in being essentially simple and
direct. A few of his 240 fables may be
used to good effect with children, though
they have their main charm for the more
sophisticated older reader. (See Nos. <a href="#Note_234">234</a>,

is that made in 1841 by Elizur

that La Fontaine has changed the goose
to a hen.</div>

<h4><br />THE WOLF IN SHEEP'S
CLOTHING</h4>

<p>A Wolf wrapped himself in the skin of
a Sheep and by that means got admission
into a sheep-fold, where he devoured
several of the young Lambs. The Shepherd,
however, soon found him out and
hung him up to a tree, still in his disguise.</p>

<p>Some other Shepherds, passing that
way, thought it was a Sheep hanging,
and cried to their friend, "What, brother!
is that the way you serve Sheep in this
part of the country?"</p>

<p>"No, friends," cried he, turning the
hanging body around so that they might

<h4><br />THE HARE AND THE

<p>The Hare one day laughed at the Tortoise
for his short feet, slowness, and
awkwardness.</p>

<p>"Though you may be swift as the
wind," replied the Tortoise good-naturedly,
"I can beat you in a
race."</p>

<p>The Hare looked on the challenge as a
great joke, but consented to a trial of
speed, and the Fox was selected to act
as umpire and hold the stakes.</p>

<p>The rivals started, and the Hare, of
course, soon left the Tortoise far behind.
Having reached midway to the goal,
she began to play about, nibble the young
herbage, and amuse herself in many ways.
The day being warm, she even thought
she would take a little nap in a shady
spot, for she thought that if the Tortoise
should pass her while she slept, she could
easily overtake him again before he
reached the end.</p>

<p>The Tortoise meanwhile plodded on,
unwavering and unresting, straight
towards the goal.</p>

<p>The Hare, having overslept herself,
started up from her nap and was surprised
to find that the Tortoise was
nowhere in sight. Off she went at full
speed, but on reaching the winning-post,
found that the Tortoise was already there,
waiting for her arrival.</p>

<h4><br />THE MILLER, HIS SON,
AND THEIR ASS</h4>

<p>A Miller and his Son were driving their
Ass to a neighboring fair to sell him.
They had not gone far when they met
with a troop of women collected round a
well, talking and laughing.</p>

<p>"Look there," cried one of them, "did
you ever see such fellows, to be trudging
along the road on foot when they might
ride?"</p>

<p>The Miller, hearing this, quickly made
his Son mount the Ass, and continued to
walk along merrily by his side. Presently
they came up to a group of old men
in earnest debate.</p>

<p>"There," said one of them, "it proves
what I was saying. What respect is
shown to old age in these days? Do you
see that idle lad riding while his old father
has to walk? Get down, you young
scapegrace, and let the old man rest his
weary limbs."</p>

<p>Upon this, the Miller made his Son
dismount, and got up himself. In this
manner they had not proceeded far when
they met a company of women and
children.</p>

<p>"Why, you lazy old fellow," cried several
tongues at once, "how can you ride
upon the beast while that poor little lad
there can hardly keep pace by the side of
you?"</p>

<p>The good-natured Miller immediately
took up his Son behind him. They had
now almost reached the town.</p>

<p>"Pray, honest friend," said a citizen,
"is that Ass your own?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the old man.</p>

<p>"Oh, one would not have thought so,"
said the other, "by the way you load
him. Why, you two fellows are better
able to carry the poor beast than he
you."</p>

<p>"Anything to please you," said the
Miller; "we can but try."</p>

<p>So, alighting with his Son, they tied
the legs of the Ass together, and by the
help of a pole endeavored to carry him
on their shoulders over a bridge near the
entrance of the town. This entertaining
sight brought the people in crowds to
laugh at it, till the Ass, not liking the
noise nor the strange handling that he
was subject to, broke the cords that
bound him and, tumbling off the pole,
fell into the river. Upon this, the old
man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of
his way home again, convinced that by
trying to please everybody he had pleased
nobody, and lost his Ass into the bargain.</p>

any dangers that might befall. They

rushed out from a thicket and stood in
their path. One of the Travelers, a
light, nimble fellow, got up into a tree.
The other, seeing that there was no
chance to defend himself single-handed,
fell flat on his face and held his breath.
The Bear came up and smelled at him,
and taking him for dead, went off again
into the wood. The Man in the tree
came down and, rejoining his companion,
asked him, with a sly smile, what was the
wonderful secret which he had seen the
Bear whisper into his ear.</p>

<h4><br />THE LARK AND HER
YOUNG ONES</h4>

<p>A Lark, who had Young Ones in a field
of grain which was almost ripe, was
afraid that the reapers would come
before her young brood were fledged.
So every day when she flew off to look
for food, she charged them to take note
of what they heard in her absence and
to tell her of it when she came home.</p>

<p>One day when she was gone, they
heard the owner of the field say to his
son that the grain seemed ripe enough to
be cut, and tell him to go early the next
day and ask their friends and neighbors
to come and help reap it.</p>

<p>When the old Lark came home, the
Little Ones quivered and chirped round
her and told her what had happened,
begging her to take them away as fast
as she could. The mother bade them
be easy; "for," said she, "if he depends
on his friends and his neighbors, I am
sure the grain will not be reaped tomorrow."</p>

<p>Next day she went out again and left
the same orders as before. The owner
came, and waited. The sun grew hot,
but nothing was done, for not a soul
came. "You see," said the owner to his
son, "these friends of ours are not to be
depended upon; so run off at once to your
uncles and cousins, and say I wish them
to come early to-morrow morning and
help us reap."</p>

<p>This the Young Ones, in a great fright,
told also to their mother. "Do not
fear, children," said she. "Kindred and
relations are not always very forward
in helping one another; but keep your
ears open and let me know what you hear
to-morrow."</p>

<p>The owner came the next day, and,
finding his relations as backward as his
neighbors, said to his son, "Now listen
to me. Get two good sickles ready for
to-morrow morning, for it seems we must
reap the grain by ourselves."</p>

<p>The Young Ones told this to their
mother.</p>

<p>"Then, my dears," said she, "it is time
for us to go; for when a man undertakes
to do his work himself, it is not so likely
that he will be disappointed." She took
away her Young Ones at once, and the
grain was reaped the next day by the old
man and his son.</p>

try each in turn to break it across. Each
put forth all his strength, but the bundle
resisted their efforts. Then, cutting the
cord which bound the sticks together,
he told his Sons to break them separately.
This was done with the greatest
ease.</p>

bank of a river, and by chance let slip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
his axe into the water, when it immediately
sank to the bottom. Being thereupon
in great distress, he sat down by the
side of the stream and lamented his loss
bitterly. But Mercury, whose river it
was, taking compassion on him, appeared
at the instant before him; and hearing
from him the cause of his sorrow, dived
to the bottom of the river, and bringing
up a golden axe, asked the Woodman if
that were his. Upon the Man's denying
it, Mercury dived a second time, and
brought up one of silver. Again the
Man denied that it was his. So diving
a third time, he produced the identical
axe which the Man had lost. "That is
mine!" said the Woodman, delighted to
have recovered his own; and so pleased
was Mercury with the fellow's truth and
honesty that he at once made him a
present of the other two.</p>

<p>The Man goes to his companions, and
giving them an account of what had happened
to him, one of them determined
to try whether he might not have the
like good fortune. So repairing to the
same place, as if for the purpose of cutting
wood, he let slip his axe on purpose into
the river and then sat down on the bank
and made a great show of weeping.
Mercury appeared as before, and hearing
from him that his tears were
caused by the loss of his axe, dived once
more into the stream; and bringing up a
golden axe, asked him if that was the axe
he had lost.</p>

<p>"Aye, surely," said the Man, eagerly;
and he was about to grasp the treasure,
when Mercury, to punish his impudence
and lying, not only refused to give him
that, but would not so much as restore
him his own axe again.</p>

<h4><br />THE MOUNTEBANK AND

<p>A certain wealthy patrician, intending
to treat the Roman people with some
theatrical entertainment, publicly offered
a reward to any one who would produce
a novel spectacle. Incited by emulation,
artists arrived from all parts to contest
the prize, among whom a well-known
witty Mountebank gave out that he had
a new kind of entertainment that had
never yet been produced on any stage.
This report, being spread abroad, brought
the whole city together. The theater
could hardly contain the number of spectators.
And when the artist appeared
alone upon the stage, without any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
apparatus or any assistants, curiosity and
suspense kept the spectators in profound
silence. On a sudden he thrust down
his head into his bosom, and mimicked
the squeaking of a young pig so naturally
that the audience insisted upon it that
he had one under his cloak and ordered
him to be searched, which, being done
and nothing appearing, they loaded him
with the most extravagant applause.</p>

<p>A Countryman among the audience
observed what passed. "Oh!" says he,
"I can do better than this"; and immediately
gave out that he would perform the
next day. Accordingly on the morrow
a yet greater crowd was collected. Prepossessed,
however, in favor of the
Mountebank, they came rather to laugh
at the Countryman than to pass a fair
judgment on him. They both came out
upon the stage. The Mountebank grunts
away at first, and calls forth the greatest
clapping and applause. Then the Countryman,
pretending that he concealed a
little pig under his garments (and he had,
in fact, really got one) pinched its ear
till he made it squeak. The people cried
out that the Mountebank had imitated
the pig much more naturally, and hooted
to the Countryman to quit the stage; but
he, to convict them to their face, produced
the real pig from his bosom. "And
now, gentlemen, you may see," said he,
"what a pretty sort of judges you are!"</p>

<p><i>It is easier to convict a man against his
senses than against his will.</i></p>

<div class="hang1">Stories dealing with the disastrous effects of
"day-dreaming" are very common in the
world's literature. The three selections
that follow are given as very familiar
samples for comparison. The first is a
simple version by Jacobs.</div>


<h4><br />THE MILKMAID AND HER PAIL</h4>

<p>Patty, the Milkmaid, was going to
market, carrying her milk in a Pail on her
head. As she went along she began
calculating what she could do with the
money she would get for the milk. "I'll
buy some fowls from Farmer Brown,"
said she, "and they will lay eggs each
morning, which I will sell to the parson's
wife. With the money that I get from
the sale of these eggs I'll buy myself a
new dimity frock and a chip hat; and
when I go to market, won't all the young
men come up and speak to me! Polly
Shaw will be that jealous; but I don't
care. I shall just look at her and toss
my head like this." As she spoke, she
tossed her head back, the Pail fell off it
and all the milk was spilt. So she had
to go home and tell her mother what had
occurred.</p>

<p>"Ah, my child," said her mother,</p>

<p>"<i>Do not count your chickens before they are
hatched.</i>"</p>

<div class="hang1">The next is Wright's translation of La Fontaine's
famous fable on the day-dreaming
theme. Notice how much more complicated
its application becomes in contrast
with the obvious truth of the proverb in
the preceding version. La Fontaine is
responsible for the story's popularity in
modern times. The most fascinating study
on the way fables have come down to us
is Max M&uuml;ller's "On the Migration of
Fables," in which he follows this story from
India through all its many changes until
it reaches us in La Fontaine.</div>

<div class="hang1">The day-dreaming idea is next presented in
the form found in the story of the barber's
fifth brother in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>. Would
this story be any more effective if it had a
paragraph at the end stating and emphasizing
the moral?</div>


<h4><br />THE STORY OF ALNASCHAR</h4>

<p>Alnaschar, my fifth brother, was very
lazy, and of course wretchedly poor. On
the death of our father we divided his
property, and each of us received a hundred
drachms of silver for his share.
Alnaschar, who hated labor, laid out his
money in fine glasses, and having displayed
his stock to the best advantage in
a large basket, he took his stand in the
market-place, with his back against the
wall, waiting for customers. In this
posture he indulged in a reverie, talking
aloud to himself as follows:</p>

<p>"This glass cost me a hundred drachms
of silver, which is all I have in the world.
I shall make two hundred by retailing
it, and of these very shortly four hundred.
It will not be long before these produce
four thousand. Money, they say, begets
money. I shall soon therefore be possessed
of eight thousand, and when these
become ten thousand I will no longer be
a glass-seller. I will trade in pearls and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
diamonds; and as I shall become rich
apace, I will have a splendid palace, a
great estate, slaves, and horses; I will not,
however, leave traffic till I have acquired
a hundred thousand drachms. Then I
shall be as great as a prince, and will
assume manners accordingly.</p>

<p>"I will demand the daughter of the
grand vizier in marriage, who, no doubt,
will be glad of an alliance with a man of
my consequence. The marriage ceremony
shall be performed with the utmost
splendor and magnificence. I will have
my horse clothed with the richest housings,
ornamented with diamonds and
pearls, and will be attended by a number
of slaves, all richly dressed, when I go
to the vizier's palace to conduct my wife
thence to my own. The vizier shall
receive me with great pomp, and shall
give me the right hand and place me
above himself, to do me the more honor.
On my return I will appoint two of my
handsomest slaves to throw money among
the populace, that every one may speak
well of my generosity.</p>

<p>"When we arrive at my own palace,
I will take great state upon me, and
hardly speak to my wife. She shall
dress herself in all her ornaments, and
stand before me as beautiful as the full
moon, but I will not look at her. Her
slaves shall draw near and entreat me
to cast my eyes upon her; which, after
much supplication, I will deign to do,
though with great indifference. I will
not suffer her to come out of her apartment
without my leave; and when I have
a mind to visit her there, it shall be in a
manner that will make her respect
me. Thus will I begin early to teach
her what she is to expect the rest of
her life.</p>

<p>"When her mother comes to visit her
she will intercede with me for her. 'Sir,'
she will say (for she will not dare to call
me son, for fear of offending me by so
much familiarity), 'do not, I beseech,
treat my daughter with scorn; she is as
beautiful as an Houri, and entirely devoted
to you.' But my mother-in-law
may as well hold her peace, for I will take
no notice of what she says. She will then
pour out some wine into a goblet, and
give it to my wife, saying, 'Present it to
your lord and husband; he will not surely
be so cruel as to refuse it from so fair a
hand.' My wife will then come with the
glass, and stand trembling before me;
and when she finds that I do not look on
her, but continue to disdain her, she will
kneel and entreat me to accept it; but
I will continue inflexible. At last, redoubling
her tears, she will rise and put
the goblet to my lips, when, tired with
her importunities, I will dart a terrible
look at her and give her such a push with
my foot as will spurn her from me."
Alnaschar was so interested in this
imaginary grandeur that he thrust forth
his foot to kick the lady, and by that
means overturned his glasses and broke
them into a thousand pieces.</p>

<div class="hang1">"The Camel and the Pig" is from P. V.
Ramaswami Raju's <i>Indian Folk Stories
and Fables</i>, an excellent book of adaptations
for young readers. The idea that
every situation in life has its advantages
as well as its disadvantages is one of those
common but often overlooked truths which
serve so well as the themes of fable. Emerson's
"Fable," the story of the quarrel
between the mountain and the squirrel, is
a most excellent presentation of the same
idea (see No. <a href="#Note_363">363</a>). "The Little Elf,"
by John Kendrick Bangs, makes the same
point for smaller folks.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />THE CAMEL AND THE PIG</h4>

<div class='center'>ADAPTED BY P. V. RAMASWAMI RAJU</div>

<p>A camel said, "Nothing like being tall!
See how tall I am!"</p>

<p>A Pig who heard these words said,
"Nothing like being short; see how short
I am!"</p>

<p>The Camel said, "Well, if I fail to
prove the truth of what I said, I will give
up my hump."</p>

<p>The Pig said, "If I fail to prove the
truth of what I have said, I will give up
my snout."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" said the Camel.</p>

<p>"Just so!" said the Pig.</p>

<p>They came to a garden inclosed by a
low wall without any opening. The
Camel stood on this side the wall, and,
reaching the plants within by means of
his long neck, made a breakfast on them.
Then he turned jeeringly to the Pig, who
had been standing at the bottom of the
wall, without even having a look at the
good things in the garden, and said,
"Now, would you be tall or short?"</p>

<p>Next they came to a garden inclosed
by a high wall, with a wicket gate at one
end. The Pig entered by the gate and,
after having eaten his fill of the vegetables
within, came out, laughing at the poor
Camel, who had to stay outside, because
he was too tall to enter the garden by the
gate, and said, "Now, would you be tall
or short?"</p>

<p>Then they thought the matter over,
and came to the conclusion that the
Camel should keep his hump and the Pig
his snout, observing,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Tall is good, where tall would do;<br />
Of short, again, 'tis also true!"<br />

<h3><br /><a name="Note_237" id="Note_237">237</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Many scholars have believed that all fables
originated in India. The great Indian
collection of symbolic stories known as
Jataka Tales, or Buddhist Birth Stories,
has been called "the oldest, most complete,
and most important collection of folklore
extant." They are called Birth Stories
because each one gives an account of something
that happened in connection with the
teaching of Buddha in some previous
"birth" or incarnation. There are about
550 of these Jatakas, including some 2000
stories. They have now been made accessible
in a translation by a group of English
scholars and published in six volumes under
the general editorship of Professor Cowell.
Many of them have long been familiar in
eastern collections and have been adapted
in recent times for use in schools. Each
Jataka is made up of three parts. There
is a "story of the present" giving an account
of an incident in Buddha's life which calls
to his mind a "story of the past" in which
he had played a part during a former
incarnation. Then, there is a conclusion
marking the results. Nos. <a href="#Note_237">237</a> and <a href="#Note_238">238</a> are
literal translations of Jatakas by T. W.
Rhys-Davids in his <i>Buddhist Birth Stories</i>.
In adapting for children, the stories of the
present may be omitted. In fact, everything
except the direct story should be
eliminated. The "gathas," or verses, were
very important in connection with the
original purpose of religious teaching, but
are only incumbrances in telling the story
either for its own sake or for its moral.</div>


<h4><br />THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN</h4>

<p>At the same time when Brahma-datta
was reigning in Benares, the future
Buddha was born one of a peasant family;
and when he grew up he gained his living
by tilling the ground.</p>

<p>At that time a hawker used to go from
place to place, trafficking in goods carried
by an ass. Now at each place he came
to, when he took the pack down from the
ass's back, he used to clothe him in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
lion's skin and turn him loose in the rice
and barley fields. And when the watchmen
in the fields saw the ass they dared
not go near him, taking him for a lion.</p>

<p>So one day the hawker stopped in a
village; and while he was getting his own
breakfast cooked, he dressed the ass in a
lion's skin and turned him loose in a
barley field. The watchmen in the field
dared not go up to him; but going home,
they published the news. Then all the
villagers came out with weapons in their
hands; and blowing chanks, and beating
drums, they went near the field and
shouted. Terrified with the fear of
death, the ass uttered a cry&mdash;the bray of
an ass!</p>

<p>And when he knew him then to be an
ass, the future Buddha pronounced the
first verse:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"This is not a lion's roaring,<br />
Nor a tiger's nor a panther's;<br />
Dressed in a lion's skin,<br />
'Tis a wretched ass that roars!"<br />
</div>

<p>But when the villagers knew the
creature to be an ass, they beat him till
his bones broke; and, carrying off the
lion's skin, went away. Then the hawker
came; and seeing the ass fallen into so
bad a plight, pronounced the second
verse:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Long might the ass,<br />
Clad in a lion's skin,<br />
Have fed on the barley green;<br />
But he brayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that moment he came to ruin."</span><br />
</div>

<p>And even while he was yet speaking
the ass died on the spot.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_238" id="Note_238">238</a></h3>


<h4><br />THE TALKATIVE TORTOISE</h4>

<p>The future Buddha was once born in
a minister's family, when Brahma-datta
was reigning in Benares; and when he
grew up he became the king's adviser in
things temporal and spiritual.</p>

<p>Now this king was very talkative;
while he was speaking others had no
opportunity for a word. And the future
Buddha, wanting to cure this talkativeness
of his, was constantly seeking for
some means of doing so.</p>

<p>At that time there was living, in a
pond in the Himalaya mountains, a
tortoise. Two young hamsas, or wild
ducks, who came to feed there, made
friends with him, and one day, when
they had become very intimate with him,
they said to the tortoise:</p>

<p>"Friend tortoise! the place where we
live, at the Golden Cave on Mount Beautiful
in the Himalaya country, is a
delightful spot. Will you come there
with us?"</p>

<p>"But how can I get there?"</p>

<p>"We can take you if you can only hold
your tongue, and will say nothing to
anybody."</p>

<p>"Oh! that I can do. Take me with
you."</p>

<p>"That's right," said they. And making
the tortoise bite hold of a stick, they
themselves took the two ends in their
teeth, and flew up into the air.</p>

<p>Seeing him thus carried by the hamsas,
some villagers called out, "Two wild
ducks are carrying a tortoise along on a
stick!" Whereupon the tortoise wanted
to say, "If my friends choose to carry
me, what is that to you, you wretched
slaves!" So just as the swift flight of
the wild ducks had brought him over
the king's palace in the city of Benares,
he let go of the stick he was biting, and
falling in the open courtyard, split in
two! And there arose a universal cry,
"A tortoise has fallen in the open courtyard,
and has split in two!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The king, taking the future Buddha,
went to the place, surrounded by his
courtiers; and looking at the tortoise,
he asked the Bodisat, "Teacher! how
comes he to be fallen here?"</p>

<p>The future Buddha thought to himself,
"Long expecting, wishing to admonish
the king, have I sought for some
means of doing so. This tortoise must
have made friends with the wild ducks;
and they must have made him bite hold
of the stick, and have flown up into the
air to take him to the hills. But he,
being unable to hold his tongue when he
hears any one else talk, must have
wanted to say something, and let go the
stick; and so must have fallen down
from the sky, and thus lost his life."
And saying, "Truly, O king! those who
are called chatter-boxes&mdash;people whose
words have no end&mdash;come to grief like
this," he uttered these verses:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Verily the tortoise killed himself<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While uttering his voice;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Though he was holding tight the stick,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By a word himself he slew.</span><br />
<br />
"Behold him then, O excellent by strength!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And speak wise words, not out of season.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You see how, by his talking overmuch,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The tortoise fell into this wretched plight!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>The king saw that he was himself
referred to, and said, "O Teacher! are
you speaking of us?"</p>

<p>And the Bodisat spake openly, and
said, "O great king! be it thou, or be it
any other, whoever talks beyond measure
meets with some mishap like this."</p>

<p>And the king henceforth refrained himself,
and became a man of few words.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_239" id="Note_239">239</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The following is, also, an oriental story. It
is taken from the <i>Hitopadesa</i> (Book of
Good Counsel), a collection of Sanskrit
fables. This collection was compiled from
older sources, probably in the main from
the <i>Panchatantra</i> (Five Books), which
belonged to about the fifth century.
Observe the emphasis placed upon the
teaching of the fable by putting the statement
of it at the beginning and recurring
to it at the close.</div>


<h4><br />A LION TRICKED BY A RABBIT</h4>

<p><i>He who hath sense hath strength. Where hath
he strength who wanteth judgment? See how a
lion, when intoxicated with anger, was overcome
by a rabbit.</i></p>

<p>Upon the mountain Mandara there
lived a lion, whose name was Durganta
(hard to go near), who was very exact
in complying with the ordinance for
animal sacrifices. So at length all the
different species assembled, and in a
body represented that, as by his present
mode of proceeding the forest would be
cleared all at once, if it pleased his
Highness, they would each of them in
his turn provide him an animal for his
daily food. And the lion gave his consent
accordingly. Thus every beast
delivered his stipulated provision, till
at length, it coming to the rabbit's turn,
he began to meditate in this manner:
"Policy should be practiced by him who
would save his life; and I myself shall
lose mine if I do not take care. Suppose
I lead him after another lion? Who
knows how that may turn out for me?
I will approach him slowly, as if fatigued."</p>

<p>The lion by this time began to be very
hungry; so, seeing the rabbit coming
toward him, he called out in a great
passion, "What is the reason thou comest
so late?"</p>

<p>"Please your Highness," said the rabbit,
"as I was coming along I was
forcibly detained by another of your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
species; but having given him my word
that I would return immediately, I came
here to represent it to your Highness."</p>

<p>"Go quickly," said the lion in a rage,
"and show me where this vile wretch
may be found!"</p>

<p>Accordingly, the rabbit conducted the
lion to the brink of a deep well, where
being arrived, "There," said the rabbit,
"look down and behold him." At the
same time he pointed to the reflected
image of the lion in the water, who,
swelling with pride and resentment,
leaped into the well, as he thought, upon
his adversary; and thus put an end to
his life.</p>

<p>I repeat, therefore:</p>

<p><i>He who hath sense hath strength. Where hath
he strength who wanteth judgment?</i></p>

<div class="hang1">Marie de France lived probably in the latter

<h4><br />THE COCK AND THE FOX</h4>

<div class='center'>MARIE DE FRANCE<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
A Cock our story tells of, who<br />
High on a trash hill stood and crew.<br />
A Fox, attracted, straight drew nigh,<br />
And spake soft words of flattery.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Dear Sir!" said he, "your look's divine;</span><br />
I never saw a bird so fine!<br />
I never heard a voice so clear<br />
Except your father's&mdash;ah! poor dear!<br />
His voice rang clearly, loudly&mdash;but<br />
Most clearly when his eyes were shut!"<br />
"The same with me!" the Cock replies,<br />
And flaps his wings, and shuts his eyes.<br />
Each note rings clearer than the last&mdash;<br />
The Fox starts up and holds him fast;<br />
Toward the wood he hies apace.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as he crossed an open space,</span><br />
The shepherds spy him; off they fly;<br />
The dogs give chase with hue and cry.<br />
The Fox still holds the Cock, though fear<br />
Suggests his case is growing queer.<br />
"Tush!" cries the Cock, "cry out, to grieve 'em,<br />
'The cock is mine! I'll never leave him!'"<br />
The Fox attempts, in scorn, to shout,<br />
And opes his mouth; the Cock slips out,<br />
And in a trice has gained a tree.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too late the Fox begins to see</span><br />
How well the Cock his game has played;<br />
For once his tricks have been repaid.<br />
In angry language, uncontrolled,<br />
He 'gins to curse the mouth that's bold<br />
To speak, when it should silent be.<br />
"Well," says the Cock, "the same with me;<br />
I curse the eyes that go to sleep<br />
Just when they ought sharp watch to keep<br />
Lest evil to their lord befall."<br />

They chatter when they should be dumb,<br />

<h3><br /><a name="Note_241" id="Note_241">241</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The following is Wright's translation of the
first fable in La Fontaine's collection.
Rousseau, objecting to fables in general,
singled out this particular one as an example
of their bad effects on children, and echoes
of his voice are still in evidence. It would,
he said, give children a lesson in inhumanity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
"You believe you are making an example
of the grasshopper, but they will choose
the ant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they will take the more
pleasant part, which is a very natural
thing." Another observer said: "As for
me, I love neither grasshopper nor ant,
neither avarice nor prodigality, neither the
miserly people who lend nor the spendthrifts
who borrow." These statements
represent complex, analytic points of view
which are probably outside the range of
most children. They will see the grasshopper
simply as a type of thorough
shiftlessness and the ant as a type of
forethought, although La Fontaine does
suggest that the ant might on general
principles be a little less "tight-fisted."
The lesson that idleness is the mother of
want, the necessity of looking ahead, of
providing for the future, of laying up for
a rainy day&mdash;these are certainly common-sense
conclusions and the only ones the
story itself will suggest to the child.</div>


<h4><br />THE GRASSHOPPER AND
THE ANT</h4>

<div class='center'>LA FONTAINE<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
A grasshopper gay<br />
Sang the summer away,<br />
And found herself poor<br />
By the winter's first roar.<br />
Of meat or of bread,<br />
Not a morsel she had!<br />
So a begging she went,<br />
To her neighbor the ant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the loan of some wheat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which would serve her to eat,</span><br />
Till the season came round.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I will pay you," she saith,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"On an animal's faith,</span><br />
Double weight in the pound<br />
Ere the harvest be bound."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ant is a friend</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(And here she might mend)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little given to lend.</span><br />
"How spent you the summer?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth she, looking shame</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the borrowing dame.</span><br />
"Night and day to each comer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I sang, if you please."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You sang! I'm at ease;</span><br />
For 'tis plain at a glance,<br />
Now, ma'am, you must dance."<br />

<h4><br />THE COCK, THE CAT, AND
THE YOUNG MOUSE</h4>

<div class='center'>LA FONTAINE<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
A pert young Mouse, to whom the world was new,<br />
Had once a near escape, if all be true.<br />
He told his mother, as I now tell you:<br />
"I crossed the mountains that beyond us rise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, journeying onwards, bore me</span><br />
As one who had a great career before me,<br />
When lo! two creatures met my wondering eyes,&mdash;<br />
The one of gracious mien, benign and mild;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The other fierce and wild,</span><br />
With high-pitched voice that filled me with alarm;<br />
A lump of sanguine flesh grew on his head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with a kind of arm</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He raised himself in air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if to hover there;</span><br />
His tail was like a horseman's plume outspread."<br />
(It was a farmyard Cock, you understand,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>That our young friend described in terms so grand,<br />
As 'twere some marvel come from foreign land.)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With arms raised high</span><br />
He beat his sides, and made such hideous cry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That even I,</span><br />
Brave as I am, thank heaven! had well-nigh fainted:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Straightway I took to flight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cursed him left and right.</span><br />
Ah! but for him, I might have got acquainted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With that sweet creature,</span><br />
Who bore attractiveness in every feature:<br />
A velvet skin he had, like yours and mine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A tail so long and fine,</span><br />
A sweet, meek countenance, a modest air&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet, what an eye was there!</span><br />
I feel that, on the whole,<br />
He must have strong affinities of soul<br />
With our great race&mdash;our ears are shaped the same.<br />
I should have made my bow, and asked his name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But at the fearful cry</span><br />
Raised by that monster, I was forced to fly."<br />
"My child," replied his mother, "you have seen<br />
That demure hypocrite we call a Cat:<br />
Under that sleek and inoffensive mien<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He bears a deadly hate of Mouse and Rat.</span><br />
The other, whom you feared, is harmless&mdash;quite;<br />
Nay, perhaps may serve us for a meal some night.<br />
As for your friend, for all his innocent air,<br />
We form the staple of his bill of fare."<br />

<div class="hang1">John Gay (1685-1732) was an English poet
and dramatist. His work as a whole has
been pretty well forgotten, but he has been
recently brought back to the mind of the
public by the revival of his satirical <i>Beggar's
Opera</i>, the ancestor of the modern comic
opera. Gay published a collection of fables
in verse in 1727, "prepared for the edification
of the young Duke of Cumberland."
A second group, making sixty-six in all, was
published after his death. Since these
fables are probably the best of their kind
in English, a few of them are frequently
met with in collections. "The Hare with
Many Friends" has been the favorite, and
rightly so, as it has something of the humor
and point that belong to the real fable.
Perhaps the fact that it has a personal
application enabled Gay to write with
more vigor and sincerity than elsewhere.</div>


<h4><br />THE HARE WITH MANY
FRIENDS</h4>

<div class='center'>JOHN GAY<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Friendship, like love, is but a name,<br />
Unless to one you stint the flame.<br />
The child whom many fathers share,<br />
Hath seldom known a father's care.<br />
'Tis thus in friendship; who depend<br />
On many rarely find a friend.<br />
A Hare, who, in a civil way,<br />
Complied with everything, like Gay,<br />
Was known by all the bestial train<br />
Who haunt the wood, or graze the plain.<br />
Her care was, never to offend,<br />
And every creature was her friend.<br />
As forth she went at early dawn,<br />
To taste the dew-besprinkled lawn,<br />
Behind she hears the hunter's cries,<br />
And from the deep-mouthed thunder flies.<br />
She starts, she stops, she pants for breath;<br />
She hears the near advance of death;<br />
She doubles, to mislead the hound,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>And measures back her mazy round:<br />
Till, fainting in the public way,<br />
Half dead with fear she gasping lay.<br />
What transport in her bosom grew,<br />
When first the Horse appeared in view!<br />
"Let me," says she, "your back ascend,<br />
And owe my safety to a friend.<br />
You know my feet betray my flight;<br />
To friendship every burden's light."<br />
The Horse replied: "Poor honest Puss,<br />
It grieves my heart to see thee thus;<br />
Be comforted; relief is near,<br />
For all your friends are in the rear."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She next the stately Bull implored;</span><br />
And thus replied the mighty lord,<br />
"Since every beast alive can tell<br />
That I sincerely wish you well,<br />
I may, without offence, pretend,<br />
To take the freedom of a friend;<br />
Love calls me hence; a favorite cow<br />
Expects me near yon barley-mow;<br />
And when a lady's in the case,<br />
You know, all other things give place.<br />
To leave you thus might seem unkind;<br />
But see, the Goat is just behind."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Goat remarked her pulse was high,</span><br />
Her languid head, her heavy eye;<br />
"My back," says he, "may do you harm;<br />
The Sheep's at hand, and wool is warm."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Sheep was feeble, and complained</span><br />
His sides a load of wool sustained:<br />
Said he was slow, confessed his fears,<br />
For hounds eat sheep as well as hares.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She now the trotting Calf addressed,</span><br />
To save from death a friend distressed.<br />
"Shall I," says he, "of tender age,<br />
In this important care, engage?<br />
Older and abler passed you by;<br />
How strong are those, how weak am I!<br />
Should I presume to bear you hence,<br />
Those friends of mine may take offence.<br />
Excuse me, then. You know my heart.<br />
But dearest friends, alas, must part!<br />
How shall we all lament! Adieu!<br />
For see, the hounds are just in view."<br />

poet of some note, remembered now mainly
as the author of <i>Literary Fables</i>, the first
attempt at literary fable-writing in Spanish.
As the name is meant to imply, they concern
themselves with the follies and weaknesses
of authors. There are about eighty
fables in the complete collection, and they
are full of ingenuity and cleverness. One
of the simplest and best of these is given
here in the translation by R. Rockliffe,
which first appeared in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>

by which even stupidity sometimes "makes
a hit" and then stupidly proceeds to pat

Until he spied by accident<br />
A flute, which some oblivious gent<br />
Had left behind by accident;<br />
When, sniffing it with eager scent,<br />
He breathed on it by accident,<br />
And made the hollow instrument<br />
Emit a sound by accident.<br />
"Hurrah! hurrah!" exclaimed the brute,<br />
"How cleverly I play the flute!"<br />

<div class="hang1">This fable from the Old Testament is one of
the very oldest on record in which a story
is practically applied to a human problem.
The causes of political corruption apparently
have not changed much in three
thousand years. American citizens gather
together at certain times to choose mayors
and other officers to rule over them, and
when they say to the fruitful olive tree, or
fig tree, or vine, "Come thou and reign
over us," he replies, "Should I forsake my
productive factory, or mine, or profession,
to be mayor?" But when they say to the
bramble, "Come thou and reign over us,"
he replies, "Put your trust in me, and let
those suffer who object to my management
of public affairs." Jotham's lesson of
political duty is one greatly needed in the
present-day attempt to raise our standard
of citizenship.</div>


<h4><br />THE BRAMBLE IS MADE
KING</h4>

<div class='center'><i>Judges ix: 6-16</i></div>

<p>And all the men of Shechem gathered
together, and all the house of Millo, and
went, and made Abimelech king, by the
plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.
And when they told it to Jotham, he
went and stood in the top of Mount
Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried,
and said unto them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem,
that God may hearken unto you. The
trees went forth on a time to anoint a
king over them; and they said unto the
olive tree, 'Reign thou over us.' But
the olive tree said unto them, 'Should I
leave my fatness, wherewith by me they
honor God and man, and go to be promoted
over the trees?'</p>

<p>"And the trees said to the fig tree,
'Come thou and reign over us.' But
the fig tree said unto them, 'Should I
forsake my sweetness and my good fruit,
and go to be promoted over the trees?'</p>

<p>"Then said the trees unto the vine,
'Come thou and reign over us.' And the
vine said unto them, 'Should I leave my
wine, which cheereth God and man, and
go to be promoted over the trees?'</p>

<p>"Then said all the trees unto the bramble,
'Come thou and reign over us.' And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the bramble said unto the trees, 'If in
truth ye anoint me king over you, then
come and put your trust in my shadow:
and if not, let fire come out of the bramble
and devour the cedars of Lebanon.'"</p>

<div class="hang1">The concrete illustrations by means of which
Jesus constantly taught are called parables.
"Without a parable spake he not unto
them." The parable differs from the fable
proper in dealing with more fundamental
or ideal truth. The fable moves on the
plane of the prudential virtues, the parable
on the plane of the higher self-forgetting
virtues. Because of that difference there
is in the parable "no jesting nor raillery
at the weakness, the follies, or the crimes
of men." All is deeply earnest, befitting
its high spiritual point of view. As a rule
the parables use for illustration stories of
what might actually happen. Two of the
most familiar of the parables follow. What
true neighborliness means is the message
of "The Good Samaritan."</div>


<h4><br />THE GOOD SAMARITAN</h4>

<div class='center'><i>Luke x:25-37</i></div>

<p>And behold, a certain lawyer stood up
and tempted him, saying, "Master, what
shall I do to inherit eternal life?" He
said unto him, "What is written in the
law? how readest thou?" And he
answering said, "Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy
strength, and with all thy mind; and thy
neighbor as thyself." And He said unto
him, "Thou hast answered right; this do,
and thou shalt live." But he, willing to
justify himself, said unto Jesus, "And
who is my neighbor?"</p>

<p>And Jesus answering said, "A certain
man went down from Jerusalem to
Jericho, and fell among thieves, which
stripped him of his raiment, and wounded
him, and departed, leaving him half
dead. And by chance there came down
a certain priest that way; and when
he saw him, he passed by on the other
side. And likewise a Levite, when he
was at the place, came and looked on
him, and passed by on the other side.
But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed,
came where he was; and when he saw
him, he had compassion on him, and
went to him, and bound up his wounds,
pouring in oil and wine, and set him on
his own beast, and brought him to an
inn, and took care of him. And on the
morrow, when he departed, he took out
two pence and gave them to the host
and said unto him, 'Take care of him: and
whatsoever thou spendest more, when I
come again I will repay thee.'</p>

<p>"Which now of these three, thinkest
thou, was neighbor unto him that fell
among the thieves?"</p>

<p>And he said, "He that showed mercy
on him."</p>

<p>Then said Jesus unto him, "Go and
do thou likewise."</p>

<h4><br />THE PRODIGAL SON</h4>

<div class='center'><i>Luke xv:10-32</i></div>

<p>"Likewise I say unto you, there is joy
in the presence of the angels of God over
one sinner that repenteth."</p>

<p>And he said, "A certain man had two
sons; and the younger of them said to
his father, 'Father, give me the portion
of goods that falleth to me.' And he
divided unto them his living.</p>

<p>"And not many days after, the younger
son gathered all together, and took his
journey into a far country, and there
wasted his substance with riotous living.
And when he had spent all, there arose
a mighty famine in that land; and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
began to be in want. And he went and
joined himself to a citizen of that country;
and he sent him into his fields to
feed swine. And he would fain have
filled his belly with the husks that the
swine did eat; and no man gave unto
him.</p>

<p>"And when he came to himself, he
said, 'How many hired servants of my
father's have bread enough and to spare,
and I perish with hunger! I will arise
and go to my father, and will say unto him,
"Father, I have sinned against heaven
and before thee, and am no more worthy
to be called thy son; make me as one
of thy hired servants."'</p>

<p>"And he arose and came to his father.
But when he was yet a great way off, his
father saw him, and had compassion, and
ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
And the son said unto him, 'Father, I
have sinned against heaven and in thy
sight, and am no more worthy to be
called thy son.' But the father said to
his servants, 'Bring forth the best robe
and put it on him; and put a ring on his
hand, and shoes on his feet; and bring
hither the fatted calf and kill it; and let
us eat and be merry; for this my son was
dead and is alive again; he was lost and
is found.' And they began to be merry.</p>

<p>"Now his elder son was in the field; and
as he came and drew nigh to the house,
he heard music and dancing. And he
called one of the servants and asked what
these things meant. And he said unto
him, 'Thy brother is come; and thy
father hath killed the fatted calf, because
he hath received him safe and sound.'
And he was angry and would not go
in; therefore came his father out and
entreated him. And he answering, said
to his father, 'Lo, these many years do
I serve thee, neither transgressed I at
any time thy commandment; and yet
thou never gavest me a kid that I might
make merry with my friends. But as
soon as this thy son was come, which
hath devoured thy living with harlots,
thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.'
And he said unto him, 'Son, thou art
ever with me; and all that I have is
thine. It was meet that we should make
merry, and be glad; for this thy brother
was dead, and is alive again; and was
lost, and is found.'"</p>

<div class="hang1">This little apologue is taken from <i>Norwood</i>
(1867), a novel written by Henry Ward
Beecher for the New York <i>Ledger</i> in the
days when that periodical, under the
direction of Robert Bonner, was the great
family weekly of America. In the course
of the fiction Mr. Beecher emphasizes the
value of stories for children. "Story-hunger
in children," he says, "is even more
urgent than bread-hunger." And after
the story has been told: "How charming
it is to narrate fables for children.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Children are unconscious philosophers.
They refuse to pull to pieces their enjoyments
to see what they are made of. Rose
knew as well as her father that leaves never
talked. Yet, Rose never saw a leaf without
feeling that there was life and meaning
in it."</div>


<h4><br />THE ANXIOUS LEAF</h4>

<div class='center'>HENRY WARD BEECHER</div>

<p>Once upon a time a little leaf was heard
to sigh and cry, as leaves often do when
a gentle wind is about.</p>

<p>And the twig said, "What is the matter,
little leaf?"</p>

<p>And the leaf said, "The wind just told
me that one day it would pull me off and
throw me down to die on the ground!"</p>

<p>The twig told it to the branch on which
it grew, and the branch told it to the tree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
And when the tree heard it, it rustled all
over, and sent back word to the leaf,
"Do not be afraid; hold on tightly, and
you shall not go till you want to." And
so the leaf stopped sighing, but went on
nestling and singing.</p>

<p>Every time the tree shook itself and
stirred up all its leaves, the branches
shook themselves, and the little twig
shook itself, and the little leaf danced up
and down merrily, as if nothing could
ever pull it off.</p>

<p>And so it grew all summer long till
October. And when the bright days of
autumn came, the little leaf saw all the
leaves around becoming very beautiful.
Some were yellow, and some scarlet, and
some striped with both colors.</p>

<p>Then it asked the tree what it meant.
And the tree said, "All these leaves are
getting ready to fly away, and they have
put on these beautiful colors, because of
joy."</p>

<p>Then the little leaf began to want to
go, and grew very beautiful in thinking
of it, and when it was very gay in color,
it saw that the branches of the tree had
no color in them, and so the leaf said,
"Oh, branches! why are you lead color
and we golden?"</p>

<p>"We must keep on our work clothes,
for our life is not done; but your clothes
are for holiday, because your tasks are
over."</p>

<p>Just then, a little puff of wind came,
and the leaf let go without thinking of it,
and the wind took it up, and turned it
over and over, and whirled it like a spark
of fire in the air and then it fell gently
down under the edge of the fence among
hundreds of leaves, and fell into a dream
and never waked up to tell what it
dreamed about!</p>

<div class="hang1">Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790), more than
any other American, has emphasized for
us the value of proverbial sayings and the
significance of the symbolic story. This
account of how one may pay too much for
a whistle was written in 1779 while Franklin
was representing the colonies at Paris, and
addressed to his friend Madame Brillon.
The making of apologues seemed to be a
favorite sort of game in the circle in which
Franklin moved, and his plain common
sense is always uppermost in whatever he
produces. The lesson of the whistle is
always needed; we are prone to put aside
the essential thing for the temporary and
showy. More than a century ago Noah
Webster put this story in his school-reader,
and most school-readers since have contained
it. The selection is here reprinted
complete. Teachers usually omit some of
the opening and closing paragraphs.</div>


<h4><br />THE WHISTLE</h4>

<div class='center'>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</div>

<p>I am charmed with your description of
Paradise, and with your plan of living
there; and I approve much of your conclusion,
that, in the mean time, we
should draw all the good we can from this
world. In my opinion, we might all
draw more good than we do, and suffer
less evil, if we would take care not to give
too much for <i>whistles</i>. For to me it
seems that most of the unhappy people
we meet with are become so by neglect
of that caution.</p>

<p>You ask what I mean? You love
stories, and will excuse my telling one of
myself.</p>

<p>When I was a child of seven years old,
my friends, on a holiday, filled my pockets
with coppers. I went directly to a
shop where they sold toys for children;
and being charmed with the sound of a
<i>whistle</i>, that I met by the way in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
hands of another boy, I voluntarily
offered and gave all my money for one.
I then came home, and went whistling
all over the house, much pleased with my
<i>whistle</i>, but disturbing all the family.
My brothers, and sisters, and cousins,
understanding the bargain I had made,
told me I had given four times as much
for it as it was worth; put me in mind
what good things I might have bought
with the rest of the money; and laughed
at me so much for my folly, that I cried
with vexation; and the reflection gave
me more chagrin than the <i>whistle</i> gave
me pleasure.</p>

<p>This, however, was afterward of use
to me, the impression continuing on my
mind; so that often, when I was tempted
to buy some unnecessary thing, I said
to myself, <i>Don't give too much for the
whistle;</i> and I saved my money.</p>

<p>As I grew up I thought I met with
many, very many, who <i>gave too much for
the whistle</i>.</p>

<p>When I saw one too ambitious of court
favor, sacrificing his time, his repose, his
liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his
friends, to attain it, I have said to myself,
<i>This man gives too much for his
whistle.</i></p>

<p>When I saw another fond of popularity,
constantly employing himself in political
bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and
ruining them by that neglect, <i>He pays,
indeed</i>, said I, <i>too much for his whistle.</i></p>

<p>If I knew a miser, who gave up every
kind of comfortable living, all the pleasure
of doing good to others, all the esteem
of his fellow-citizens, and the joys of
benevolent friendship, for the sake of
accumulating wealth, <i>Poor man</i>, said I,
<i>you pay too much for your whistle.</i></p>

<p>When I met with a man of pleasure,
sacrificing every laudable improvement
of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere
corporal sensations, and ruining his
health in their pursuit, <i>Mistaken man</i>,
said I, <i>you are providing pain for yourself,
instead of pleasure; you give too much
for your whistle.</i></p>

<p>If I see one fond of appearance, or fine
clothes, fine houses, fine furniture, fine
equipages, all above his fortune, for which
he contracts debts, and ends his career
in a prison, <i>Alas!</i> say I, <i>he has paid dear,
very dear, for his whistle.</i></p>

<p>When I see a beautiful, sweet-tempered
girl married to an ill-natured brute
of a husband, <i>What a pity</i>, say I, <i>that she
should pay so much for a whistle!</i></p>

<p>In short, I conceive that great part of
the miseries of mankind are brought upon
them by the false estimates they have
made of the value of things, and by their
<i>giving too much for their whistles</i>.</p>

<p>Yet I ought to have charity for these
unhappy people, when I consider that,
with all this wisdom of which I am
boasting, there are certain things in the
world so tempting, for example, the
apples of King John, which happily are
not to be bought; for if they were put to
sale by auction, I might very easily
be led to ruin myself in the purchase, and
find that I had once more given too much
for the <i>whistle</i>.</p>

<div class="hang1">"The Ephemera" was also addressed to
Madame Brillon, the "amiable Brillante"
of the final sentence. It is an allegorical
story emphasizing the relative shortness of
human life. Franklin's "Alas! art is long
and life is short!" anticipates Longfellow's
"Art is long and time is fleeting." But
hundreds of writers had preceded both of
them in calling attention to this at the same
time commonplace and significant fact.
At the end, Franklin's quiet acceptance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of the rather gloomy outlook suggested
by the ephemeral nature of life is noteworthy,
and is characteristic of his general
temper.</div>


<h4><br />THE EPHEMERA</h4>

<div class='center'><i>An Emblem of Human Life</i><br />
<br />
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</div>

<p>You may remember, my dear friend,
that when we lately spent that happy
day in the delightful garden and sweet
society of the Moulin Joly, I stopped a
little in one of our walks, and stayed
some time behind the company. We
had been shown numberless skeletons of
a kind of little fly, called an ephemera,
whose successive generations, we were
told, were bred and expired within the
day. I happened to see a living company
of them on a leaf, who appeared to be
engaged in conversation. You know
I understand all the inferior animal
tongues. My too great application to
the study of them is the best excuse I
can give for the little progress I have
made in your charming language. I
listened through curiosity to the discourse
of these little creatures; but as
they, in their national vivacity, spoke
three or four together, I could make but
little of their conversation. I found,
however, by some broken expressions
that I heard now and then, they were
disputing warmly on the merit of two
foreign musicians, one a <i>cousin</i>, the
other a <i>moscheto;</i> in which dispute they
spent their time, seemingly as regardless
of the shortness of life as if they had been
sure of living a month. Happy people!
thought I; you live certainly under a
wise, just, and mild government, since
you have no public grievances to complain
of, nor any subject of contention
but the perfections and imperfections of
foreign music. I turned my head from
them to an old grey-headed one, who was
single on another leaf, and talking to
himself. Being amused with his soliloquy,
I put it down in writing, in hopes
it will likewise amuse her to whom I
am so much indebted for the most pleasing
of all amusements, her delicious company
and heavenly harmony.</p>

<p>"It was," said he, "the opinion of learn&egrave;d
philosophers of our race, who lived and
flourished long before my time, that this
vast world, the Moulin Joly, could not
itself subsist more than eighteen hours;
and I think there was some foundation
for that opinion, since, by the apparent
motion of the great luminary that gives
life to all nature, and which in my time
has evidently declined considerably towards
the ocean at the end of our earth,
it must then finish its course, be extinguished
in the waters that surround us,
and leave the world in cold and darkness,
necessarily producing universal death and
destruction. I have lived seven of those
hours, a great age, being no less than
four hundred and twenty minutes of
time. How very few of us continue so
long! I have seen generations born,
flourish, and expire. My present friends
are the children and grandchildren of the
friends of my youth, who are now, also,
no more! And I must soon follow them;
for, by the course of nature, though still
in health, I cannot expect to live above
seven or eight minutes longer. What
now avails all my toil and labor in amassing
honey-dew on this leaf, which I cannot
live to enjoy! What the political
struggles I have been engaged in, for
the good of my compatriot inhabitants
of this bush, or my philosophical studies
for the benefit of our race in general! for,
in politics, what can laws do without
morals? Our present race of ephemerae<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
will in a course of minutes become
corrupt, like those of other and older
bushes, and consequently as wretched.
And in philosophy how small is our
progress! Alas! art is long, and life is
short! My friends would comfort me
with the idea of a name, they say, I
shall leave behind me; and they tell me
I have lived long enough to nature and
to glory. But what will fame be to an
ephemera who no longer exists? And
what will become of all history in the
eighteenth hour, when the world itself,
even the whole Moulin Joly, shall come
to its end, and be buried in universal
ruin?"</p>

<p>To me, after all my eager pursuits, no
solid pleasures now remain, but the reflection
of a long life spent in meaning well,
the sensible conversation of a few good
lady ephemerae, and now and then a
kind smile and a tune from the ever
amiable <i>Brillante</i>.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_252" id="Note_252">252</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The brief allegory that follows is very generally
regarded as the finest and noblest
specimen of its type. It is here reprinted
approximately in the form of its first
appearance, now more than two hundred
years ago, as more in keeping with its
spirit than a modern dress would be. The
world of recent times is not so much given
to this kind of writing as the eighteenth
century was. Like Franklin's "Ephemera,"
Addison's vision grows out of "profound
contemplation on the vanity of human
life." The key to the symbolism is found
in the "threescore and ten arches" of the
bridge, representing the scriptural limit of
physical existence, with some broken arches
for any excess of that limit. The fact that
"the bridge consisted at first of a thousand
arches" is a reference to the great number
of years assigned to some of the patriarchs.
The splendid concluding vision in which
Mirzah sees the compensations for the ills
of this life suggests a very different type
of mind from that of the "this-worldly"
closing paragraph in Franklin's apologue.
"The Vision of Mirzah" is No. <a href="#Note_159">159</a> of the
<i>Spectator</i> (September 1, 1711).</div>


<h4><br />THE VISION OF MIRZAH</h4>

<div class='center'>JOSEPH ADDISON</div>

<p>When I was at Grand Cairo I picked
up several oriental manuscripts, which I
have still by me. Among others I met
with one entitled The Visions of Mirzah,
which I have read over with great pleasure.
I intend to give it to the public
when I have no other entertainment for
them; and I shall begin with the first
vision, which I have translated word for
word as follows:</p>

<p>On the fifth day of the moon, which
according to the custom of my forefathers
I always kept holy, after having
washed myself, and offered up my morning
devotions, I ascended the high hills
of Bagdat, in order to pass the rest of
the day in meditation and prayer. As
I was here airing myself on the tops of
the mountains, I fell into profound contemplation
on the vanity of human life;
and passing from one thought to another,
surely, said I, man is but a shadow and
life a dream. Whilst I was thus musing,
I cast my eyes towards the summit of
a rock that was not far from me, where I
discovered one in the habit of a shepherd,
with a musical instrument in his hand.
As I looked upon him he applied it to his
lips, and began to play upon it. The
sound of it was exceeding sweet, and
wrought into a variety of tunes that
were inexpressibly melodious, and altogether
different from anything I had ever
heard. They put me in mind of those
heavenly airs that are played to the
departed souls of good men upon their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
first arrival in paradise to wear out the
impressions of their last agonies, and
qualify them for the pleasures of that
happy place. My heart melted away in
secret raptures.</p>

<p>I had been often told that the rock
before me was the haunt of a genius; and
that several had been entertained with
music who had passed by it, but never
heard that the musician had before made
himself visible. When he had raised my
thoughts by those transporting airs
which he played, to taste the pleasure of
his conversation, as I looked upon him
like one astonished, he beckoned to me,
and by the waving of his hand directed
me to approach the place where he sat.
I drew near with that reverence which is
due to a superior nature: and as my heart
was entirely subdued by the captivating
strains I had heard, I fell down at his
feet and wept. The genius smiled upon
me with a look of compassion and affability
that familiarized him to my imagination,
and at once dispelled all the fears
and apprehensions with which I approached
him. He lifted me from the
ground, and taking me by the hand,
Mirzah, said he, I have heard thee in thy
soliloquies: follow me.</p>

<p>He then led me to the highest pinnacle
of the rock, and placed me on the top of
it. Cast thy eyes eastward, said he, and
tell me what thou seest. I see, said I, a
huge valley and a prodigious tide of
water rolling through it. The valley that
thou seest, said he, is the vale of misery,
and the tide of water that thou seest is
part of the great tide of eternity. What
is the reason, said I, that the tide I see
rises out of a thick mist at one end, and
again loses itself in a thick mist at the
other? What thou seest, says he, is
that portion of eternity which is called
time, measured out by the sun, and
reaching from the beginning of the world
to its consummation. Examine now,
said he, this sea that is thus bounded with
darkness at both ends, and tell me what
thou discoverest in it. I see a bridge,
said I, standing in the midst of the tide.
The bridge thou seest, said he, is human
life; consider it attentively. Upon a
more leisurely survey of it, I found that
it consisted of threescore and ten entire
arches, with several broken arches, which
added to those that were entire, made up
the number about an hundred. As I was
counting the arches the genius told me
that the bridge consisted at first of a
thousand arches; but that a great flood
swept away the rest, and left the bridge
in the ruinous condition I now beheld it.
But tell me further, said he, what thou
discoverest on it. I see multitudes of
people passing over it, said I, and a
black cloud hanging on each end of it.
As I looked more attentively, I saw several
of the passengers dropping through
the bridge, into the great tide that
flowed underneath it; and upon further
examination, perceived there were innumerable
trap-doors that lay concealed in
the bridge which the passengers no
sooner trod upon, but they fell through
them into the tide and immediately
disappeared. These hidden pit-falls were
set very thick at the entrance of the
bridge, so that the throngs of people no
sooner broke through the cloud, but many
of them fell into them. They grew thinner
towards the middle, but multiplied
and lay closer together towards the end
of the arches that were entire.</p>

<p>There were indeed some persons, but
their number was very small, that
continued a kind of hobbling march
on the broken arches, but fell through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
one after another, being quite tired and
spent with so long a walk.</p>

<p>I passed some time in the contemplation
of this wonderful structure, and the
great variety of objects which it presented.
My heart was filled with a deep
melancholy to see several dropping unexpectedly
in the midst of mirth and jollity,
and catching at everything that stood
by them to save themselves. Some were
looking up towards the heavens in a
thoughtful posture, and in the midst of a
speculation stumbled and fell out of
sight. Multitudes were very busy in the
pursuit of baubles that glittered in their
eyes and danced before them, but often
when they thought themselves within the
reach of them, their footing failed and
down they sank. In this confusion of
objects, I observed some with scimetars in
their hands, who ran to and fro upon the
bridge, thrusting several persons upon trap-doors
which did not seem to lie in their
way, and which they might have escaped,
had they not been thus forced upon them.</p>

<p>The genius seeing me indulge myself
in this melancholy prospect, told me I
had dwelt long enough upon it: take
thine eyes off the bridge, said he, and tell
me if thou seest anything thou dost not
comprehend. Upon looking up, what
mean, said I, those great flights of birds
that are perpetually hovering about the
bridge, and settling upon it from time to
time? I see vultures, harpies, ravens,
cormorants, and among many other
feathered creatures several little wing&egrave;d
boys, that perch in great numbers upon
the middle arches. These, said the
genius, are envy, avarice, superstition,
despair, love, with the like cares and passions
that infect human life.</p>

<p>I here fetched a deep sigh; alas, said
I, man was made in vain! How is he
given away to misery and mortality!
tortured in life, and swallowed up in
death! The genius, being moved with
compassion towards me, bid me quit
so uncomfortable a prospect. Look no
more, said he, on a man in the first stage
of his existence, in his setting out for
eternity; but cast thine eye on that
thick mist into which the tide bears the
several generations of mortals that fall
into it. I directed my sight as was
ordered, and (whether or no the good
genius strengthened it with any supernatural
force, or dissipated part of the
mist that was before too thick for the
eye to penetrate) I saw the valley opening
at the farther end, and spreading
forth into an immense ocean that had a
huge rock of adamant running through
the midst of it, and dividing it into two
equal parts. The clouds still rested on
one-half of it, insomuch that I could discover
nothing in it; but the other appeared
to me a vast ocean planted with
innumerable islands, that were covered
with fruits and flowers, and interwoven
with a thousand little shining seas that
ran among them. I could see persons
dressed in glorious habits with garlands
upon their heads, passing among the
trees, lying down by the sides of the
fountains, or resting on beds of flowers;
and could hear a confused harmony of
singing birds, falling waters, human
voices, and musical instruments. Gladness
grew in me upon the discovery of
so delightful a scene. I wished for the
wings of an eagle, that I might fly away
to those happy seats; but the genius told
me there was no passage to them except
through the gates of death that I saw
opening every moment upon the bridge.
The islands, said he, that lie so fresh
and green before thee, and with which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the whole face of the ocean appears
spotted as far as thou canst see, are more
in number than the sands of the sea-shore;
there are myriads of islands
behind those which thou here discoverest,
reaching farther than thy eyes, or even
than thine imagination, can extend itself.
These are the mansions of good men
after death, who, according to the degree
and kinds of virtue in which they excelled,
are distributed among these
several islands, which abound with pleasures
of different kinds and degrees, suitable
to the relishes and perfections of
those who are settled in them; every
island is a paradise, accommodated to its
respective inhabitants. Are not these,
O Mirzah, habitations worth contending
for? Does life appear miserable that
gives the opportunities of earning such a
reward? Is death to be feared that will
convey thee to so happy an existence?
Think not a man was made in vain who
has such an eternity reserved for him.
I gazed with inexpressible pleasure on
these happy islands. At length, said I,
Show me now, I beseech thee, the secrets
that lie hid under those dark clouds which
cover the ocean on the other side of the
rock of adamant. The genius making
me no answer, I turned about to address
myself to him a second time, but I found
that he had left me. I then turned
again to the vision which I had been so
long contemplating, but, instead of the
rolling tide, the arched bridge, and the
happy islands, I saw nothing but the long
hollow valley of Bagdat, with oxen, sheep,
and camels grazing upon the sides of it.</p>

<div class="hang1">"The Discontented Pendulum" was one of
seventy-nine brief prose selections by Jane
Taylor (1783-1824) which appeared first
in a paper for young people and were,
after the author's death, gathered together
and published as <i>Contributions of Q. Q.</i>
(1826). This one selection only from that
volume still lives, is reprinted often in
school-readers, and by virtue of its cleverness
and point deserves its happy fate.
The author attached to it a "Moral"
almost as long as the story itself, and that
has long since fallen by the wayside.
Perhaps that is because the story is too
clear to need the "Moral." Here are a
few sentences from it: "The <i>present</i> is
all we have to manage: the past is irrecoverable;
the future is uncertain; nor
is it fair to burden one moment with the
weight of the next. Sufficient unto the
<i>moment</i> is the trouble thereof.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One
moment comes laden with its own <i>little</i>
burden, then flies, and is succeeded by
another no heavier than the last; if <i>one</i>
could be sustained, so can another, and
another.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let any one resolve to do
right <i>now</i>, leaving <i>then</i> to do as it can, and
if he were to live to the age of Methuselah,
he would never err.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let us then,
'whatever our hands find to do, do it with
all our might, recollecting that <i>now</i> is the
proper and the accepted time.'"</div>


<h4><br />THE DISCONTENTED PENDULUM</h4>

<div class='center'>JANE TAYLOR</div>

<p>An old clock that had stood for fifty
years in a farmer's kitchen without giving
its owner any cause of complaint,
early one summer's morning, before the
family was stirring, suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>Upon this, the dial-plate (if we may
credit the fable) changed countenance
with alarm: the hands made an ineffectual
effort to continue their course; the
wheels remained motionless with surprise;
the weights hung speechless; each
member felt disposed to lay the blame
on the others. At length the dial instituted
a formal inquiry as to the cause of
the stagnation; when hands, wheels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
weights, with one voice, protested their
innocence. But now a faint tick was
heard below, from the pendulum, who
thus spoke:</p>

<p>"I confess myself to be the sole cause
of the present stoppage; and am willing,
for the general satisfaction, to assign my
reasons. The truth is that I am tired
of ticking." Upon hearing this, the old
clock became so enraged that it was on
the point of <i>striking</i>.</p>

<p>"Lazy wire!" exclaimed the dial-plate,
holding up its hands.</p>

<p>"Very good!" replied the pendulum,
"it is vastly easy for you, Mistress Dial,
who have always, as everybody knows,
set yourself up above me&mdash;it is vastly
easy for you, I say, to accuse other
people of laziness! You, who have had
nothing to do all the days of your life
but to stare people in the face, and to
amuse yourself with watching all that
goes on in the kitchen! Think, I beseech
you, how you would like to be shut up for
life in this dark closet, and wag backwards
and forwards, year after year, as I do."</p>

<p>"As to that," said the dial, "is there
not a window in your house on purpose
for you to look through?"</p>

<p>"For all that," resumed the pendulum,
"it is very dark here; and although there
is a window, I dare not stop, even for an
instant, to look out. Besides, I am really
weary of my way of life; and if you
please, I'll tell you how I took this disgust
at my employment. This morning
I happened to be calculating how many
times I should have to tick in the course
only of the next twenty-four hours: perhaps
some of you, above there, can give
me the exact sum."</p>

<p>The minute hand, being <i>quick at figures</i>,
instantly replied, "Eighty-six thousand
four hundred times."</p>

<p>"Exactly so," replied the pendulum:
"well, I appeal to you all, if the thought
of this was not enough to fatigue one?
And when I began to multiply the stroke
of one day by those of months and years,
really it is no wonder if I felt discouraged
at the prospect; so after a great deal of
reasoning and hesitation, thinks I to
myself&mdash;I'll stop."</p>

<p>The dial could scarcely keep its countenance
during this harangue; but, resuming
its gravity, thus replied:</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Pendulum, I am really
astonished that such a useful, industrious
person as yourself should have
been overcome by this sudden suggestion.
It is true you have done a great deal of
work in your time. So we have all, and are
likely to do; and although this may fatigue
us to <i>think</i> of, the question is, whether it
it will fatigue us to <i>do:</i> would you now do
me the favor to give about half a dozen
strokes to illustrate my argument?"</p>

<p>The pendulum complied, and ticked
six times at its usual pace. "Now,"
resumed the dial, "may I be allowed to
inquire if that exertion was at all fatiguing
or disagreeable to you?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," replied the
pendulum;&mdash;"It is not of six strokes that I
complain, nor of sixty, but of <i>millions</i>."</p>

<p>"Very good," replied the dial, "but
recollect that although you may <i>think</i> of
a million strokes in an instant, you are
required to <i>execute</i> but one; and that
however often you may hereafter have
to swing, a moment will always be given
you to swing in."</p>

<p>"That consideration staggers me, I
confess," said the pendulum.</p>

<p>"Then I hope," resumed the dial-plate,
"we shall all immediately return
to our duty; for the maids will lie in bed
till noon if we stand idling thus."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this, the weights, who had never
been accused of <i>light</i> conduct, used all
their influence in urging him to proceed;
when, as with one consent, the wheels
began to turn, the hands began to move,
the pendulum began to wag, and, to its
credit, ticked as loud as ever; while a
beam of the rising sun that streamed
through a hole in the kitchen shutter,
shining full upon the dial-plate, it brightened
up as if nothing had been the matter.</p>

<p>When the farmer came down to breakfast
that morning, upon looking at the
clock he declared that his watch had
gained half an hour in the night.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_254" id="Note_254">254</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Count Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) was a Russian
novelist, poet, and social reformer; author,
among other important works, of <i>War and
Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i>. He wrote many
short stories and sketches, a number of
which are markedly symbolic in character.
The one that follows is a good illustration
of a type of such tales pleasing to modern
minds. We no longer produce the formal
fable or allegory. In Tolstoy's story are
two historical characters of so pronounced
individuality that their names always
suggest definite ideas&mdash;Croesus, riches and
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wordly'">worldly</ins> greatness; Solon, wisdom and
worldly poverty and lowliness. These
ideas are brought into conflict, and the outcome
allows us to see which is the basic
one in Tolstoy's theory of life. Who is the
happy warrior? One would merely have to
quote some words from the story to have
an answer. And if the reader feels the
force of the answer, as Tolstoy evidently
hoped he would, it means a new or at
least a more distinctly held ideal of living.</div>


<h4><br />CROESUS AND SOLON</h4>

<div class='center'>LEO TOLSTOY</div>

<p>In olden times&mdash;long, long before the
coming of Christ&mdash;there reigned over a
certain country a great king called
Croesus. He had much gold and silver,
and many precious stones, as well as
numberless soldiers and slaves. Indeed,
he thought that in all the world there
could be no happier man than himself.</p>

<p>But one day there chanced to visit the
country which Croesus ruled a Greek
philosopher named Solon. Far and wide
was Solon famed as a wise man and a
just; and, inasmuch as his fame had
reached Croesus also, the king commanded
that he should be conducted to
his presence.</p>

<p>Seated upon his throne, and robed in
his most gorgeous apparel, Croesus asked
of Solon: "Have you ever seen aught
more splendid than this?"</p>

<p>"Of a surety have I," replied Solon.
"Peacocks, cocks, and pheasants glitter
with colors so diverse and so brilliant
that no art can compare with them."</p>

<p>Croesus was silent as he thought to
himself: "Since this is not enough, I
must show him something more, to surprise
him."</p>

<p>So he exhibited the whole of his riches
before Solon's eyes, as well as boasted of
the number of foes he had slain, and the
number of territories he had conquered.
Then he said to the philosopher:</p>

<p>"You have lived long in the world, and
have visited many countries. Tell me
whom you consider to be the happiest
man living?"</p>

<p>"The happiest man living I consider
to be a certain poor man who lives in
Athens," replied Solon.</p>

<p>The king was surprised at this answer,
for he had made certain that Solon would
name him himself; yet, for all that, the
philosopher had named a perfectly obscure
individual!</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" asked Croesus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because," replied Solon, "the man of
whom I speak has worked hard all his
life, has been content with little, has
reared fine children, has served his city
honorably, and has achieved a noble
reputation."</p>

<p>When Croesus heard this he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"And do you reckon my happiness as
nothing, and consider that I am not fit
to be compared with the man of whom
you speak?"</p>

<p>To this Solon replied:</p>

<p>"Often it befalls that a poor man is
happier than a rich man. Call no man
happy until he is dead."</p>

<p>The king dismissed Solon, for he was
not pleased at his words, and had no
belief in him.</p>

<p>"A fig for melancholy!" he thought.
"While a man lives he should live for
pleasure."</p>

<p>So he forgot about Solon entirely.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards the king's son
went hunting, but wounded himself by a
mischance, and died of the wound. Next,
it was told to Croesus that the powerful
Emperor Cyrus was coming to make war
upon him.</p>

<p>So Croesus went out against Cyrus
with a great army, but the enemy proved
the stronger, and, having won the battle
and shattered Croesus' forces, penetrated
to the capital.</p>

<p>Then the foreign soldiers began to pillage
all King Croesus' riches, and to slay
the inhabitants, and to sack and fire the
city. One soldier seized Croesus himself,
and was just about to stab him, when the
king's son darted forward to defend his
father, and cried aloud:</p>

<p>"Do not touch him! That is Croesus,
the king!"</p>

<p>So the soldiers bound Croesus, and
carried him away to the Emperor; but
Cyrus was celebrating his victory at a
banquet, and could not speak with the
captive, so orders were sent out for
Croesus to be executed.</p>

<p>In the middle of the city square the
soldiers built a great burning-pile, and
upon the top of it they placed King
Croesus, bound him to a stake, and set
fire to the pile.</p>

<p>Croesus gazed around him, upon his
city and upon his palace. Then he
remembered the words of the Greek
philosopher, and, bursting into tears,
could only say:</p>

<p>"Ah, Solon, Solon!"</p>

<p>The soldiers were closing in about the
pile when the Emperor Cyrus arrived in
person to view the execution. As he did
so he caught these words uttered by
Croesus, but could not understand them.</p>

<p>So he commanded Croesus to be taken
from the pile, and inquired of him what
he had just said. Croesus answered:</p>

<p>"I was but naming the name of a wise
man&mdash;of one who told me a great truth&mdash;a
truth that is of greater worth than
all earthly riches, than all our kingly
glory."</p>

<p>And Croesus related to Cyrus his conversation
with Solon. The story touched
the heart of the Emperor, for he bethought
him that he too was but a man,
that he too knew not what Fate might
have in store for him. So in the end he
had mercy upon Croesus, and became his
friend.</p>

<h2>SECTION VI. MYTHS</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p><i>What myths are.</i> It seems that every race of people in the period of barbarism
and early civilization has created fanciful, childlike stories to explain such things
as the origin of earth, sun, stars, clouds, life, death, fire, man, lower animals, and
plants, and the characteristics of particular plants and animals. In most cases, if
not all, they have accounted for the origin of such things by the theory that they
were created by gods and super-human heroes. Among such peoples as the Greek
and Norse folk, many stories also grew up regarding the gods and super-human
heroes and their relations with one another and with men. All of these old stories
about the creation of things and about the gods and super-human heroes are called
myths. As time went on and the peoples became civilized, the original myths were
regarded merely as fanciful tales, and were used to furnish characters and plots
for many stories told chiefly for entertainment. Often, as in the story of Ulysses,
legends of national heroes were combined with them. Even in our time such writers
as Hawthorne and Kingsley and Lowell have used these old characters and plots
as the basis of stories, many of which differ greatly from the original myths.</p>

<p><i>Myths and other folk stories.</i> Myths were pretty largely matters of faith to
begin with. They were the basis of old-time religious beliefs, explaining to the mind
of primitive man how things came to be as they are. This tendency to adopt what
are to educated minds fanciful explanations of all that is beyond their understanding
is easily observable in the way children explain the unknown. It seems fairly clear,
on the other hand, that fairy stories were told by the folk as matter of entertainment.
They did not believe that pigs actually talked, that a princess could sleep a hundred
years, that a bean-stalk could grow as fast and as far as Jack's did, or that toads
and diamonds could actually come out of one's mouth. It may be, as some theorists
insist, that remains of myth survive in some of these fairy stories. On the whole,
however, the folk believed these tales only in the sense in which we believe in a fine
story such as "The Vision of Sir Launfal" or "Enoch Arden." They express the
pleasing imaginings and longings of the human spirit, its ideals of character and
conduct, its sense of the wonder and mystery of the universe. The fairy tale, in
general, is nearer the surface of life; the myth was concerned with the most fundamental
problems of the <i>whence</i> and the <i>why</i> of things.</p>

<p>Such distinctions, however, belong to the realm of scientific scholarship. The
teacher is concerned with myths simply as splendid stories that have come down to
us from a time when human beings seemed to feel themselves bound into a unity
with nature and all mysterious powers around them; stories that through constant
repetition were rounded and perfected, and finally, through use by the poets, have
reached us in a fairly systematic form. The so-called "poetic mythology" is the one
of special value for our purposes. It comes to us through Ovid in the South, and does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
not distinguish between the gods of Greece and Rome. It comes through the Eddas
of the North. It is this poetic mythology that furnishes the basis of allusion in literature
and in art, and which is retold for us in the various versions for modern
readers. If we hold fast to this correct idea that as teachers in elementary schools
our interest in myths is exactly like our interest in other folk products, an interest
in them as stories tested by the ages, an interest in them as presenting familiar and
suggestive types of character and conduct, an interest in them as stimulating our
sense of wonder and mystery, we shall not be disturbed by the violent discussions
that sometimes rage over the advisability of using myths with children.</p>

<p><i>Values of myth.</i> To make the above proposition as clear as possible, let us
first tabulate briefly the values of myth, borrowing a suggestion from Jeremiah
Curtin:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. A wonderful story told in most effective fashion. To realize this value,
one needs to recall only the efforts of Prometheus in bringing down fire for man
and his heroic endurance of vengeful tyranny as a result. The work of Hercules
in slaying the many-headed serpent or in cleansing the Augean stables, the
adventures of Theseus culminating in the labyrinth of the horrible Minotaur, the
beautiful hospitality of Baucis and Philemon, the equally beautiful sadness of
the death of Balder&mdash;all these simply hint the riches of the myth as story.
This story interest is the one that appeals to all human beings as human beings
and is therefore fundamental.</p>

<p>2. Myth preserves much material of social and antiquarian interest. It
helps us understand the institutions and customs of primitive stages in human
development, and as such has great value for scientific students of human society.</p>

<p>3. Myth preserves evidences of how the mind of man looked out upon his
surroundings and what it did in the way of interpreting them. It makes most
valuable contributions, therefore, to the history of the human mind, and must
be taken into account in the science of anthropology.</p></div>

<p>It must be evident that the second and third values are only in the slightest
degree within the range of the child in his early years of school work.</p>

<p><i>Objections to myth.</i> The objections to the use of myths in school may also be
brought under three heads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. They come from a plane of ethics much lower than our own. This is the
one strong argument against all folk material, and it has a validity that must
be frankly recognized. There are the miscellaneous love affairs of Jupiter, and
certain stories that have elements of horror and brutality. Such stories we
cannot use, "though an error on that side is better than effeminancy." Occasional
defects cannot outweigh the great positive ethical worth of myth. We
must simply make intelligent choice. The situation is not different from what
it is in choosing from modern poetry and story. It would be poor evidence of
our sanity if we ruled out all poetry because some of it is not fit. Let us, however,
omit entirely those myths that are not suitable rather than attempt making
them over to suit modern conceptions. We may properly allow liberties
to a literary artist like Hawthorne that a mere artisan should not take.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Myth deals with the worn-out and obsolete ideas of the past, and will
give children false religious and scientific notions. But one does not rule out
<i>Paradise Lost</i> because Milton's cosmogony is so purely fanciful, nor Dante
because of his equally fantastic structure of the Inferno. Neither children nor
older readers are ever led astray by these purely incidental backgrounds against
which and by means of which the human interest is powerfully projected.</p>

<p>3. Myth is too deeply symbolical. But readers of different ages and abilities
find results up to their stature. We do not demand that the children shall be
able to understand all that is back of <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, or <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>,
before we give them those books. What is worth while in literature has an
increasing message as the powers of the reader increase.</p></div>

<p><i>How to use myths.</i> We may sum up the conclusions thus: Select those myths
that tell stories of dramatic force and that have sound ethical worth. So far as possible
let these be the ones most familiar in literary allusion and in common speech.
Present the myth as you would any other folk story. Since myth naturally comes
along a little later than fairy stories, probably beginning not earlier than the third
grade, the discussion of its meanings may take a wider range. Keep the poetic
elements of the story prominent, as in most of the examples following.</p>


<h3><br />SUGGESTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For the soundest and most illuminating discussion of the values and proper use of myths in
education see Edward Howard Griggs, <i>Moral Education</i>, chap, xxi, "The Ethical Value of Mythology
and Folk-Lore." For some good suggestions and lists consult Ezra Allen, "The Pedagogy
of Myth in the Grades," <i>Pedagogical Seminary</i>, Vol. VIII, p. 258. A very interesting plan for the use
of myths may be found in two articles by O. O. Norris, "Myths and the Teaching of Myths," <i>The
American Schoolmaster</i>, Vol. IX, p. 96 and p. 145. Consult also MacClintock, <i>Literature in the
Elementary School</i>, chap, vii, and McMurry, <i>Special Method in Reading</i>, pp. 92-105.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p><br /><br /><br /></div>

<div class='hang1'>The first nine myths in this section came
originally from Greek mythology. The
Romans adopted the mythology of the
Greeks, but changed the names of the gods.
English-speaking peoples have usually used
these Latin versions. Hence in the following
Greek myths the Roman names of the
gods are used. In this note the Greek
name is usually given in parenthesis after
the Roman.</div>

<div class='hang1'>According to mythology, Saturn once ruled
the universe. After a great war he was
overthrown and the universe was divided
into three kingdoms, each governed by one
of his sons. Jupiter (Zeus) ruled the
heavens and the earth; Neptune (Poseidon)
ruled the sea; and Pluto (Dis) ruled Hades,
or Tartarus, the gloomy region of the dead
in a cavern far under the surface of the
earth. The home of Jupiter and the many
other gods of heaven was represented as
being the top of Mount Olympus, in Thessaly.
Here each of the gods of heaven had
a separate dwelling, but all assembled at
times in the palace of Jupiter. Sometimes
these gods went to earth, through a gate of
clouds kept by goddesses called the Seasons.</div>

<div class='hang1'>The relations between these divinities were
much like those between people on earth.
Some had greater power than others, and
rivalries and quarrels frequently arose.
Jupiter, the supreme ruler, governed by
wisdom as well as by the power of his
thunderbolt. He had three sisters: Juno,
Vesta, and Ceres. Juno (Hera) was the
wife of Jupiter and the noblest of the
goddesses. Vesta (Hestia), the goddess
of health, was not married. Ceres (Demeter),
the goddess of agriculture, was the
mother of Proserpine, who became wife of
Pluto and queen of Hades. Minerva
(Athena), goddess of wisdom and Jupiter's
favorite daughter, had no mother, as she
sprang fully armed from Jupiter's head.
Venus (Aphrodite) was goddess of beauty
and mother of Cupid, god of love. Two
other goddesses were Diana (Artemis),
modest virgin goddess of the moon, who
protects brute creation, and Hebe, cup-bearer
to the gods. Among the greatest of
the gods were three sons of Jupiter: Apollo,
Mars, and Vulcan. Apollo, or Phoebus,
was god of the sun and patron of music,
archery, and prophecy. Mars (Ares) was
god of war, and Vulcan (Hephaestus), the
lame god of fire, was the blacksmith of
the gods.</div>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_255" id="Note_255">255</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">This version of the myth of Ceres and Proserpine
is taken by permission of the author
and the publishers from <i>Stories of Long
Ago</i>, by Grace H. Kupfer. (Copyright.
D. C. Heath &amp; Co., Boston.) "Of all the
beautiful fictions of Greek mythology,"
said Aubrey DeVere, "there are few more
exquisite than the story of Proserpine, and
none deeper in symbolical meaning." That
portion of its meaning fitted to the understanding
of children is indicated in the final
paragraphs of Miss Kupfer's version.
Teachers should realize that "the fable
has, however, its moral significance also,
being connected with that great mystery
of Joy and Grief, of Life and of Death, which
pressed so heavily on the mind of Pagan
Greece, and imparts to the whole of her
mythology a profound interest, spiritual as
well as philosophical. It was the restoration
of Man, not of flowers, the victory over
Death, not over Winter, with which that
high Intelligence felt itself to be really
concerned." Hawthorne's version of this
story appears in <i>Tanglewood Tales</i> as "The
Pomegranate Seeds."</div>


<h4><br />A STORY OF THE SPRINGTIME</h4>

<div class='center'>GRACE H. KUPFER</div>


<div class='center'><br />PART I</div>

<p>In the blue Mediterranean Sea, which
washes the southern shore of Europe, lies
the beautiful island of Sicily. Long, long
ago, there lived on this island a goddess
named Ceres. She had power to make
the earth yield plentiful crops of grain,
or to leave it barren; and on her depended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the food, and therefore the life of all the
people on the great, wide earth.</p>

<p>Ceres had one fair young daughter,
whom she loved very dearly. And no
wonder, for Proserpine was the sunniest,
happiest girl you could imagine.</p>

<p>Her face was all white and pink, like
apple blossoms in spring, and there was
just enough blue in her eyes to give you a
glimpse of an April morning sky. Her
long, golden curls reminded you of
the bright sunlight. In fact there was
something so young and fair and tender
about the maiden that if you could imagine
anything so strange as the whole
springtime, with all its loveliness, changed
into a human being, you would have
looked but an instant at Proserpine and
said, "She is the Spring."</p>

<p>Proserpine spent the long, happy days
in the fields, helping her mother, or dancing
and singing among the flowers, with
her young companions.</p>

<p>Way down under the earth, in the land
of the dead, lived dark King Pluto; and
the days were very lonely for him with
only shadows to talk to. Often and
often, he had tried to urge some goddess
to come and share his gloomy throne; but
not the richest jewels or wealth could
tempt any one of them to leave the bright
sunlight above and dwell in the land of
shades.</p>

<p>One day Pluto came up to earth and
was driving along in his swift chariot,
when, behind some bushes, he heard such
merry voices and musical laughter that
he drew rein, and stepping down, parted
the bushes to see who was on the other
side. There he saw Proserpine standing
in the center of a ring of laughing young
girls who were pelting her with flowers.</p>

<p>The stern old king felt his heart beat
quicker at sight of all these lovely
maidens, and he singled out Proserpine,
and said to himself, "She shall be my
queen. That fair face can make even
dark Hades light and beautiful." But he
knew it would be useless to ask the girl
for her consent; so, with a bold stride, he
stepped into the midst of the happy
circle.</p>

<p>The young girls, frightened at his dark,
stern face, fled to right and left. But
Pluto grasped Proserpine by the arm
and carried her to his chariot, and then
the horses flew along the ground, leaving
Proserpine's startled companions far
behind.</p>

<p>King Pluto knew that he must hasten
away with his prize, lest Ceres should discover
her loss; and to keep out of her
path, he drove his chariot a roundabout
way. He came to a river; but as he
neared its banks, it suddenly began to
bubble and swell and rage, so that Pluto
did not dare to drive through its waters.
To go back another way would mean
great loss of time; so with his scepter he
struck the ground thrice. It opened,
and, in an instant, horses, chariot, and
all, plunged into the darkness below.</p>

<p>But Proserpine knew that the nymph
of the stream had recognized her, and
had tried to save her by making the
waters of the stream rise. So, just as the
ground was closing over her, the girl
seized her girdle and threw it far out into
the river. She hoped that in some way
the girdle might reach Ceres and help
her to find her lost daughter.</p>


<div class='center'><br />PART II</div>

<p>In the evening Ceres returned to her
home; but her daughter, who usually
came running to meet her, was nowhere
to be seen. Ceres searched for her in
all the rooms, but they were empty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Then she lighted a great torch from the
fires of a volcano, and went wandering
among the fields, looking for her child.
When morning broke, and she had
found no trace of Proserpine, her grief
was terrible to see.</p>

<p>On that sad day, Ceres began a long,
long wandering. Over land and sea she
journeyed, bearing in her right hand the
torch which had been kindled in the
fiery volcano.</p>

<p>All her duties were neglected, and
everywhere the crops failed, and the
ground was barren and dry. Want and
famine took the place of wealth and
plenty throughout the world. It seemed
as though the great earth grieved with
the mother for the loss of beautiful
Proserpine.</p>

<p>When the starving people came to
Ceres and begged her to resume her
duties and to be their friend again,
Ceres lifted her great eyes, wearied with
endless seeking, and answered that until
Proserpine was found, she could think
only of her child, and could not care
for the neglected earth. So all the
people cried aloud to Jupiter that he
should bring Proserpine back to her
mother, for they were sadly in need of
great Ceres' help.</p>

<p>At last, after wandering over all the
earth in her fruitless search, Ceres
returned to Sicily. One day, as she was
passing a river, suddenly a little swell
of water carried something to her feet.
Stooping to see what it was, she picked
up the girdle which Proserpine had long
ago thrown to the water nymph.</p>

<p>While she was looking at it, with
tears in her eyes, she heard a fountain
near her bubbling louder and louder,
until at last it seemed to speak. And
this is what it said:</p>

<p>"I am the nymph of the fountain,
and I come from the inmost parts of
the earth, O Ceres, great mother! There
I saw your daughter seated on a throne
at the dark king's side. But in spite
of her splendor, her cheeks were pale
and her eyes were heavy with weeping.
I can stay no longer now, O Ceres, for
I must leap into the sunshine. The
bright sky calls me, and I must hasten
away."</p>

<p>Then Ceres arose and went to Jupiter
and said, "I have found the place where
my daughter is hidden. Give her back
to me, and the earth shall once more be
fruitful, and the people shall have food."</p>

<p>Jupiter was moved, both by the
mother's sorrow and by the prayers of
the people on earth; and he said that
Proserpine might return to her home if
she had tasted no food while in Pluto's
kingdom.</p>

<p>So the happy mother hastened down
into Hades. But alas! that very day
Proserpine had eaten six pomegranate
seeds; and for every one of those seeds
she was doomed each year to spend a
month underground.</p>

<p>For six months of the year Ceres is
happy with her daughter. At Proserpine's
coming, flowers bloom and birds
sing and the earth everywhere smiles
its welcome to its young queen.</p>

<p>Some people say that Proserpine really
is the springtime, and that while she is
with us all the earth seems fair and
beautiful. But when the time comes
for Proserpine to rejoin King Pluto in
his dark home underground, Ceres hides
herself and grieves through all the weary
months until her daughter's return.</p>

<p>Then the earth, too, is somber and
sad. The leaves fall to the ground, as
though the trees were weeping for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
loss of the fair, young queen; and the
flowers hide underground, until the eager
step of the maiden, returning to earth,
awakens all nature from its winter
sleep.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_256" id="Note_256">256</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Because of his beautiful idealism and the
artistic nature of his work, Hawthorne
(1804-1864) is one of America's most loved
story-tellers. His stories are never idle
tales, for each one reveals secret motives
and impulses that determine human action.
This characteristic makes his works wholesome
and inspiring for both children and
adults. Four volumes of his short stories,
intended primarily for children, are classics
for the upper grades. <i>Grandfather's Chair</i>
is a group of stories about life in New England
in early times. <i>True Stories from
History and Biography</i> makes the child
acquainted with such historical characters
as Franklin and Newton. <i>A Wonder-Book
for Girls and Boys</i> and <i>Tanglewood Tales</i> are
Hawthorne's versions of old Greek myths.</div>

<div class='hang1'>In his two volumes of Greek myths, Hawthorne
does not hold to the plot or style of
the original stories; but here, as in all his
work, he shows how incidents in life determine
human character. The following
quotation from the Preface to <i>A Wonder-Book
for Girls and Boys</i> explains in Hawthorne's
own words the nature of his version
of the myths: "He [the author] does not
plead guilty to a sacrilege in having sometimes
shaped anew, as his fancy dictated,
the forms that have been hallowed by an
antiquity of two or three thousand years.
No epoch of time can claim a copyright in
these immortal fables. They seem never
to have been made; and certainly, so long
as man exists, they can never perish; but,
by their indestructibility itself, they are
legitimate subjects for every age to clothe
with its own garniture of manners and
sentiment, and to imbue with its own
morality."</div>

<div class='hang1'>The story "The Paradise of Children," taken
from <i>A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys</i>,
is Hawthorne's version of the Greek myth
of Pandora's Box, which is an attempt to
explain how pain and suffering came to
humanity. According to the Greek myth,
Jupiter was angry when he learned that
Prometheus, one of the Titans, had given
men fire stolen from heaven. That men
might not have this blessing without an
affliction to compensate, the gods filled a
box with ills, but put Hope also in the box.
Then, fearing that neither Prometheus nor
his brother Epimetheus would open the
box, they created Pandora. Mercury, the
messenger of Jupiter, carried Pandora and
the box as a gift to Epimetheus, and the
curiosity of Pandora led her to open the
box.</div>


<h4><br />THE PARADISE OF
CHILDREN</h4>

<div class='center'>NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</div>

<p>Long, long ago, when this old world
was in its tender infancy, there was a
child named Epimetheus, who never had
either father or mother; and, that he
might not be lonely, another child, fatherless
and motherless like himself, was sent
from a far country to live with him and
be his playfellow and helpmate. Her
name was Pandora.</p>

<p>The first thing that Pandora saw,
when she entered the cottage where
Epimetheus dwelt, was a great box.
And almost the first question which she
put to him, after crossing the threshold,
was this,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Epimetheus, what have you in that
box?"</p>

<p>"My dear little Pandora," answered
Epimetheus, "that is a secret, and you
must be kind enough not to ask any
questions about it. The box was left
here to be kept safely, and I do not
myself know what it contains."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"But who gave it to you?" asked
Pandora. "And where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"That is a secret, too," replied Epimetheus.</p>

<p>"How provoking!" exclaimed Pandora,
pouting her lip. "I wish the great,
ugly box were out of the way!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, don't think of it any more,"
cried Epimetheus. "Let us run out of
doors, and have some nice play with
the other children."</p>

<p>It is thousands of years since Epimetheus
and Pandora were alive; and the
world, nowadays, is a very different sort
of thing from what it was in their time.
Then, everybody was a child. There
needed no fathers and mothers to take
care of the children; because there was
no danger, nor trouble of any kind, and
no clothes to be mended, and there was
always plenty to eat and drink. Whenever
a child wanted his dinner, he found
it growing on a tree; and, if he looked
at the tree in the morning, he could see
the expanding blossom of that night's
supper; or, at eventide, he saw the
tender bud of to-morrow's breakfast.
It was a very pleasant life, indeed. No
labor to be done, no tasks to be studied;
nothing but sports and dances, and sweet
voices of children talking, or caroling
like birds, or gushing out in merry
laughter, throughout the livelong day.</p>

<p>What was most wonderful of all, the
children never quarreled among themselves;
neither had they any crying fits;
nor, since time first began, had a single
one of these little mortals ever gone
apart into a corner, and sulked. Oh, what
a good time was that to be alive in!
The truth is, those ugly little winged
monsters, called Troubles, which are now
almost as numerous as mosquitoes, had
never yet been seen on the earth. It is
probable that the very greatest disquietude
which a child had ever experienced
was Pandora's vexation at not
being able to discover the secret of the
mysterious box.</p>

<p>This was at first only the faint shadow
of a Trouble; but, every day, it grew
more and more substantial, until, before
a great while, the cottage of Epimetheus
and Pandora was less sunshiny than
those of the other children.</p>

<p>"Whence can the box have come?"
Pandora continually kept saying to herself
and to Epimetheus. "And what in
the world can be inside of it!"</p>

<p>"Always talking about this box!"
said Epimetheus, at last; for he had
grown extremely tired of the subject.
"I wish, dear Pandora, you would try
to talk of something else. Come, let
us go and gather some ripe figs, and
eat them under the trees, for our supper.
And I know a vine that has the
sweetest and juiciest grapes you ever
tasted."</p>

<p>"Always talking about grapes and
figs!" cried Pandora, pettishly.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Epimetheus, who
was a very good-tempered child, like a
multitude of children in those days, "let
us run out and have a merry time with
our playmates."</p>

<p>"I am tired of merry times, and don't
care if I never have any more!" answered
our pettish little Pandora. "And, besides,
I never do have any. This ugly
box! I am so taken up with thinking
about it all the time. I insist upon
your telling me what is inside of it."</p>

<p>"As I have already said, fifty times
over, I do not know!" replied Epimetheus,
getting a little vexed. "How,
then, can I tell you what is inside?"</p>

<p>"You might open it," said Pandora,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
looking sideways at Epimetheus, "and
then we could see for ourselves."</p>

<p>"Pandora, what are you thinking of?"
exclaimed Epimetheus.</p>

<p>And his face expressed so much horror
at the idea of looking into a box which
had been confided to him on the condition
of his never opening it, that Pandora
thought it best not to suggest it
any more. Still, however, she could
not help thinking and talking about
the box.</p>

<p>"At least," said she, "you can tell
me how it came here."</p>

<p>"It was left at the door," replied
Epimetheus, "just before you came, by
a person who looked very smiling and
intelligent, and who could hardly forbear
laughing as he put it down. He
was dressed in an odd kind of a cloak,
and had on a cap that seemed to be
made partly of feathers, so that it looked
almost as if it had wings."</p>

<p>"What sort of a staff had he?" asked
Pandora.</p>

<p>"Oh, the most curious staff you ever
saw!" cried Epimetheus. "It was like
two serpents twisting around a stick,
and was carved so naturally that I, at
first, thought the serpents were alive."</p>

<p>"I know him," said Pandora, thoughtfully.
"Nobody else has such a staff.
It was Quicksilver; and he brought me
hither, as well as the box. No doubt
he intended it for me; and, most probably,
it contains pretty dresses for me
to wear, or toys for you and me to play
with, or something very nice for us both
to eat!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," answered Epimetheus,
turning away. "But until Quicksilver
comes back and tells us so, we have
neither of us any right to lift the lid
of the box."</p>

<p>"What a dull boy he is!" muttered
Pandora, as Epimetheus left the cottage.
"I do wish he had a little more
enterprise!"</p>

<p>For the first time since her arrival,
Epimetheus had gone out without asking
Pandora to accompany him. He
went to gather figs and grapes by himself,
or to seek whatever amusement
he could find, in other society than his
little playfellow's. He was tired to
death of hearing about the box, and
heartily wished that Quicksilver, or
whatever was the messenger's name, had
left it at some other child's door, where
Pandora would never have set eyes on
it. So perseveringly as she did babble
about this one thing! The box, the
box, and nothing but the box! It
seemed as if the box were bewitched,
and as if the cottage were not big enough
to hold it, without Pandora's continually
stumbling over it, and making
Epimetheus stumble over it likewise,
and bruising all four of their shins.</p>

<p>Well, it was really hard that poor
Epimetheus should have a box in his
ears from morning till night; especially
as the little people of the earth were so
unaccustomed to vexations, in those
happy days, that they knew not how
to deal with them. Thus, a small vexation
made as much disturbance, then,
as a far bigger one would in our own
times.</p>

<p>After Epimetheus was gone, Pandora
stood gazing at the box. She had called
it ugly, above a hundred times; but, in
spite of all that she had said against it,
it was positively a very handsome article
of furniture, and would have been quite
an ornament to any room in which it
should be placed. It was made of a
beautiful kind of wood, with dark and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
rich veins spreading over its surface,
which was so highly polished that little
Pandora could see her face in it. As
the child had no other looking-glass, it
is odd that she did not value the box,
merely on this account.</p>

<p>The edges and corners of the box
were carved with most wonderful skill.
Around the margin there were figures
of graceful men and women, and the
prettiest children ever seen, reclining or
sporting amid a profusion of flowers and
foliage; and these various objects were
so exquisitely represented, and were
wrought together in such harmony, that
flowers, foliage, and human beings seemed
to combine into a wreath of mingled
beauty. But here and there, peeping
forth from behind the carved foliage,
Pandora once or twice fancied that she
saw a face not so lovely, or something
or other that was disagreeable, and which
stole the beauty out of all the rest.
Nevertheless, on looking more closely,
and touching the spot with her finger,
she could discover nothing of the kind.
Some face, that was really beautiful, had
been made to look ugly by her catching
a sideway glimpse at it.</p>

<p>The most beautiful face of all was
done in what is called high relief, in
the center of the lid. There was nothing
else, save the dark, smooth richness of
the polished wood, and this one face in
the center, with a garland of flowers
about its brow. Pandora had looked
at this face a great many times, and
imagined that the mouth could smile if
it liked, or be grave when it chose, the
same as any living mouth. The features,
indeed, all wore a very lively and rather
mischievous expression, which looked
almost as if it needs must burst out of
the carved lips, and utter itself in words.</p>

<p>Had the mouth spoken, it would
probably have been something like this:</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, Pandora! What
harm can there be in opening the box?
Never mind that poor, simple Epimetheus!
You are wiser than he, and have
ten times as much spirit. Open the
box, and see if you do not find something
very pretty!"</p>

<p>The box, I had almost forgotten to
say, was fastened; not by a lock, nor
by any other such contrivance, but by
a very intricate knot of gold cord.
There appeared to be no end to this
knot, and no beginning. Never was a
knot so cunningly twisted, nor with so
many ins and outs, which roguishly
defied the skilfullest fingers to disentangle
them. And yet, by the very difficulty
that there was in it, Pandora was the
more tempted to examine the knot, and
just see how it was made. Two or
three times, already, she had stooped
over the box, and taken the knot between
her thumb and forefinger, but without
positively trying to undo it.</p>

<p>"I really believe," said she to herself,
"that I begin to see how it was done.
Nay, perhaps I could tie it up again,
after undoing it. There would be no
harm in that, surely. Even Epimetheus
would not blame me for that. I need
not open the box, and should not, of
course, without the foolish boy's consent,
even if the knot were untied."</p>

<p>It might have been better for Pandora
if she had had a little work to do, or
anything to employ her mind upon, so
as not to be so constantly thinking of
this one subject. But children led so
easy a life, before any Troubles came
into the world, that they had really a
great deal too much leisure. They
could not be forever playing at hide-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>and-seek
among the flower-shrubs, or
at blind-man's-buff with garlands over
their eyes, or at whatever other games
had been found out while Mother Earth
was in her babyhood. When life is all
sport, toil is the real play. There was
absolutely nothing to do. A little sweeping
and dusting about the cottage, I
suppose, and the gathering of fresh
flowers (which were only too abundant
everywhere), and arranging them in
vases,&mdash;and poor little Pandora's day's
work was over. And then, for the rest
of the day, there was the box!</p>

<p>After all, I am not quite sure that the
box was not a blessing to her in its way.
It supplied her with such a variety of
ideas to think of, and to talk about,
whenever she had anybody to listen!
When she was in good humor, she could
admire the bright polish of its sides, and
the rich border of beautiful faces and
foliage that ran all around it. Or, if she
chanced to be ill-tempered, she could
give it a push, or kick it with her naughty
little foot. And many a kick did the
box&mdash;(but it was a mischievous box, as
we shall see, and deserved all it got)&mdash;many
a kick did it receive. But, certain
it is, if it had not been for the box,
our active-minded little Pandora would
not have known half so well how to
spend her time as she now did.</p>

<p>For it was really an endless employment
to guess what was inside. What
could it be, indeed? Just imagine, my
little hearers, how busy your wits would
be, if there were a great box in the house,
which, as you might have reason to
suppose, contained something new and
pretty for your Christmas or New-Year's
gifts. Do you think that you should be
less curious than Pandora? If you were
alone with the box, might you not feel
a little tempted to lift the lid? But you
would not do it. Oh, fie! No, no!
Only, if you thought there were toys
in it, it would be so very hard to let
slip an opportunity of taking just one
peep! I know not whether Pandora
expected any toys; for none had yet
begun to be made, probably, in those
days, when the world itself was one
great plaything for the children that
dwelt upon it. But Pandora was convinced
that there was something very
beautiful and valuable in the box; and
therefore she felt just as anxious to take
a peep as any of these girls, here around
me, would have felt. And, possibly, a
little more so; but of that I am not
quite so certain.</p>

<p>On this particular day, however, which
we have so long been talking about, her
curiosity grew so much greater than it
usually was, that, at last, she approached
the box. She was more than half determined
to open it, if she could. Ah,
naughty Pandora!</p>

<p>First, however, she tried to lift it.
It was heavy; quite too heavy for the
slender strength of a child, like Pandora.
She raised one end of the box a few
inches from the floor, and let it fall
again, with a pretty loud thump. A
moment afterwards, she almost fancied
that she heard something stir, inside of
the box. She applied her ear as closely as
possible, and listened. Positively, there
did seem to be a kind of stifled murmur,
within! Or was it merely the singing in
Pandora's ears? Or could it be the beating
of her heart? The child could not
quite satisfy herself whether she had
heard anything or no. But, at all events,
her curiosity was stronger than ever.</p>

<p>As she drew back her head, her eyes
fell upon the knot of gold cord.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must have been a very ingenious
person who tied this knot," said Pandora
to herself. "But I think I could untie
it, nevertheless. I am resolved, at least,
to find the two ends of the cord."</p>

<p>So she took the golden knot in her
fingers, and pried into its intricacies as
sharply as she could. Almost without
intending it, or quite knowing what she
was about, she was soon busily engaged
in attempting to undo it. Meanwhile,
the bright sunshine came through the
open window; as did likewise the merry
voices of the children, playing at a distance,
and perhaps the voice of Epimetheus
among them. Pandora stopped
to listen. What a beautiful day it was!
Would it not be wiser if she were to let
the troublesome knot alone, and think
no more about the box, but run and
join her little playfellows, and be happy?</p>

<p>All this time, however, her fingers
were half unconsciously busy with the
knot; and, happening to glance at the
flower-wreathed face on the lid of the
enchanted box, she seemed to perceive
it slyly grinning at her.</p>

<p>"That face looks very mischievous,"
thought Pandora. "I wonder whether
it smiles because I am doing wrong! I
have the greatest mind in the world to
run away!"</p>

<p>But just then, by the merest accident,
she gave the knot a kind of a twist,
which produced a wonderful result.
The gold cord untwined itself, as if
by magic, and left the box without a
fastening.</p>

<p>"This is the strangest thing I ever
knew!" said Pandora. "What will Epimetheus
say? And how can I possibly
tie it up again?"</p>

<p>She made one or two attempts to
restore the knot, but soon found it quite
beyond her skill. It had disentangled
itself so suddenly that she could not in
the least remember how the strings had
been doubled into one another; and when
she tried to recollect the shape and
appearance of the knot, it seemed to
have gone entirely out of her mind.
Nothing was to be done, therefore, but
let the box remain as it was, until
Epimetheus should come in.</p>

<p>"But," said Pandora, "when he finds
the knot untied, he will know that I
have done it. How shall I make him
believe that I have not looked into the
box?"</p>

<p>And then the thought came into her
naughty little heart, that, since she would
be suspected of having looked into the
box, she might just as well do so, at once.
Oh, very naughty and very foolish Pandora!
You should have thought only
of doing what was right, and of leaving
undone what was wrong, and not of
what your playfellow Epimetheus would
have said or believed. And so perhaps
she might, if the enchanted face on the
lid of the box had not looked so bewitchingly
persuasive at her, and if she had
not seemed to hear, more distinctly than
before, the murmur of small voices
within. She could not tell whether it
was fancy or no; but there was quite a
little tumult of whispers in her ear,&mdash;or
else it was her curiosity that whispered:</p>

<p>"Let us out, dear Pandora,&mdash;pray let
us out! We will be such nice pretty
playfellows for you! Only let us out!"</p>

<p>"What can it be?" thought Pandora.
"Is there something alive in the box?
Well!&mdash;yes!&mdash;I am resolved to take just
one peep! Only one peep; and then the
lid shall be shut down as safely as ever!
There cannot possibly be any harm in
just one little peep!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is now time for us to see what
Epimetheus was doing.</p>

<p>This was the first time, since his little
playmate had come to dwell with him,
that he had attempted to enjoy any
pleasure in which she did not partake.
But nothing went right; nor was he
nearly so happy as on other days. He
could not find a sweet grape or a ripe
fig (if Epimetheus had a fault, it was a
little too much fondness for figs); or, if
ripe at all, they were over-ripe, and so
sweet as to be cloying. There was no
mirth in his heart, such as usually made
his voice gush out, of its own accord, and
swell the merriment of his companions.
In short, he grew so uneasy and discontented,
that the other children could not
imagine what was the matter with Epimetheus.
Neither did he himself know
what ailed him, any better than they
did. For you must recollect that at
the time we are speaking of, it was
everybody's nature, and constant habit,
to be happy. The world had not yet
learned to be otherwise. Not a single
soul or body, since these children were
first sent to enjoy themselves on the
beautiful earth, had ever been sick, or
out of sorts.</p>

<p>At length, discovering that, somehow
or other, he put a stop to all the play,
Epimetheus judged it best to go back
to Pandora, who was in a humor better
suited to his own. But, with a hope of
giving her pleasure, he gathered some
flowers, and made them into a wreath,
which he meant to put upon her head.
The flowers were very lovely,&mdash;roses,
and lilies, and orange-blossoms, and a
great many more, which left a trail of
fragrance behind, as Epimetheus carried
them along; and the wreath was put
together with as much skill as could
reasonably be expected of a boy. The
fingers of little girls, it has always
appeared to me, are the fittest to twine
flower-wreaths; but boys could do it,
in those days, rather better than they
can now.</p>

<p>And here I must mention that a great
black cloud had been gathering in the
sky, for some time past, although it
had not yet overspread the sun. But,
just as Epimetheus reached the cottage
door, this cloud began to intercept the
sunshine, and thus to make a sudden
and sad obscurity.</p>

<p>He entered softly; for he meant, if
possible, to steal behind Pandora, and
fling the wreath of flowers over her
head, before she should be aware of
his approach. But, as it happened,
there was no need of his treading so very
lightly. He might have trod as heavily
as he pleased,&mdash;as heavily as a grown
man,&mdash;as heavily, I was going to say, as
an elephant,&mdash;without much probability
of Pandora's hearing his footsteps.
She was too intent upon her purpose.
At the moment of his entering the
cottage, the naughty child had put her
hand to the lid, and was on the point of
opening the mysterious box. Epimetheus
beheld her. If he had cried out,
Pandora would probably have withdrawn
her hand, and the fatal mystery
of the box might never have been known.</p>

<p>But Epimetheus himself, although he
said very little about it, had his own
share of curiosity to know what was
inside. Perceiving that Pandora was
resolved to find out the secret, he determined
that his playfellow should not
be the only wise person in the cottage.
And if there were anything pretty or
valuable in the box, he meant to take
half of it to himself. Thus, after all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
his sage speeches to Pandora about
restraining her curiosity, Epimetheus
turned out to be quite as foolish, and
nearly as much in fault, as she. So,
whenever we blame Pandora for what
happened, we must not forget to shake
our heads at Epimetheus likewise.</p>

<p>As Pandora raised the lid, the cottage
grew very dark and dismal; for
the black cloud had now swept quite
over the sun, and seemed to have buried
it alive. There had, for a little while
past, been a low growling and muttering,
which all at once broke into a heavy
peal of thunder. But Pandora, heeding
nothing of all this, lifted the lid nearly
upright, and looked inside. It seemed
as if a sudden swarm of winged creatures
brushed past her, taking flight out of
the box, while, at the same instant, she
heard the voice of Epimetheus, with a
lamentable tone, as if he were in pain.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am stung!" cried he. "I am
stung! Naughty Pandora; why have
you opened this wicked box?"</p>

<p>Pandora let fall the lid, and, starting
up, looked about her, to see what had
befallen Epimetheus. The thunder-cloud
had so darkened the room that she could
not very clearly discern what was in it.
But she heard a disagreeable buzzing, as
if a great many huge flies, or gigantic
mosquitoes, or those insects which we
call dor-bugs and pinching-dogs, were
darting about. And, as her eyes grew
more accustomed to the imperfect light,
she saw a crowd of ugly little shapes,
with bats' wings, looking abominably
spiteful, and armed with terribly long
stings in their tails. It was one of these
that had stung Epimetheus. Nor was
it a great while before Pandora herself
began to scream, in no less pain and
affright than her playfellow, and making
a vast deal more hubbub about it. An
odious little monster had settled on her
forehead, and would have stung her I
know not how deeply, if Epimetheus had
not run and brushed it away.</p>

<p>Now, if you wish to know what these
ugly things might be, which had made
their escape out of the box, I must tell
you that they were the whole family
of earthly Troubles. There were evil
Passions; there were a great many
species of Cares; there were more than
a hundred and fifty Sorrows; there were
Diseases, in a vast number of miserable
and painful shapes; there were more
kinds of Naughtiness than it would be
of any use to talk about. In short,
everything that has since afflicted the
souls and bodies of mankind had been
shut up in the mysterious box, and given
to Epimetheus and Pandora to be kept
safely, in order that the happy children
of the world might never be molested
by them. Had they been faithful to
their trust, all would have gone well.
No grown person would ever have been
sad, nor any child have had cause to
shed a single tear, from that hour until
this moment.</p>

<p>But&mdash;and you may see by this how a
wrong act of any one mortal is a calamity
to the whole world&mdash;by Pandora's lifting
the lid of that miserable box, and
by the fault of Epimetheus, too, in not
preventing her, these Troubles have
obtained a foothold among us, and do
not seem very likely to be driven away
in a hurry. For it was impossible, as
you will easily guess, that the two
children should keep the ugly swarm
in their own little cottage. On the
contrary, the first thing that they did
was to fling open the doors and windows,
in hopes of getting rid of them; and, sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
enough, away flew the winged Troubles
all abroad, and so pestered and tormented
the small people, everywhere
about, that none of them so much as
smiled for many days afterwards. And
what was very singular, all the flowers
and dewy blossoms on earth, not one
of which had hitherto faded, now began
to droop and shed their leaves, after a
day or two. The children, moreover,
who before seemed immortal in their childhood,
now grew older, day by day, and
came soon to be youths and maidens, and
men and women by and by, and aged people,
before they dreamed of such a thing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the naughty Pandora,
and hardly less naughty Epimetheus,
remained in their cottage. Both of
them had been grievously stung, and
were in a good deal of pain, which
seemed the more intolerable to them
because it was the very first pain that
had ever been felt since the world
began. Of course, they were entirely
unaccustomed to it, and could have no
idea what it meant. Besides all this,
they were in exceedingly bad humor,
both with themselves and with one
another. In order to indulge it to the
utmost, Epimetheus sat down sullenly
in a corner with his back towards Pandora;
while Pandora flung herself upon
the floor and rested her head on the
fatal and abominable box. She was
crying bitterly, and sobbing as if her
heart would break.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a gentle little tap
on the inside of the lid.</p>

<p>"What can that be?" cried Pandora,
lifting her head.</p>

<p>But either Epimetheus had not heard
the tap, or was too much out of humor
to notice it. At any rate, he made no
answer.</p>

<p>"You are very unkind," said Pandora,
sobbing anew, "not to speak to me!"</p>

<p>Again the tap! It sounded like the
tiny knuckles of a fairy's hand, knocking
lightly and playfully on the inside of the
box.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Pandora, with
a little of her former curiosity. "Who
are you, inside of this naughty box?"</p>

<p>A sweet little voice spoke from within,</p>

<p>"Only lift the lid, and you shall see."</p>

<p>"No, no," answered Pandora, again
beginning to sob. "I have had enough
of lifting the lid! You are inside of
the box, naughty creature, and there
you shall stay! There are plenty of
your ugly brothers and sisters already
flying about the world. You need never
think that I shall be so foolish as to let
you out!"</p>

<p>She looked towards Epimetheus, as
she spoke, perhaps expecting that he
would commend her for her wisdom.
But the sullen boy only muttered that
she was wise a little too late.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the sweet little voice again,
"you had much better let me out. I
am not like those naughty creatures
that have stings in their tails. They
are no brothers and sisters of mine, as
you would see at once, if you were only
to get a glimpse of me. Come, come,
my pretty Pandora! I am sure you
will let me out!"</p>

<p>And, indeed, there was a kind of
cheerful witchery in the tone that made
it almost impossible to refuse anything
which this little voice asked. Pandora's
heart had insensibly grown lighter at
every word that came from within the
box. Epimetheus, too, though still in
the corner, had turned half round, and
seemed to be in rather better spirits
than before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear Epimetheus," cried Pandora,
"have you heard this little voice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure I have," answered
he, but in no very good humor as yet.
"And what of it?"</p>

<p>"Shall I lift the lid again?" asked
Pandora.</p>

<p>"Just as you please," said Epimetheus.
"You have done so much mischief
already that perhaps you may as well
do a little more. One other Trouble,
in such a swarm as you have let adrift
about the world, can make no very
great difference."</p>

<p>"You might speak a little more
kindly!" murmured Pandora, wiping her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, naughty boy!" cried the little
voice within the box, in an arch and
laughing tone. "He knows he is longing
to see me. Come, my dear Pandora,
lift up the lid. I am in a great hurry
to comfort you. Only let me have some
fresh air, and you shall soon see that
matters are not quite so dismal as you
think them."</p>

<p>"Epimetheus," exclaimed Pandora,
"come what may, I am resolved to
open the box."</p>

<p>"And, as the lid seems very heavy,"
cried Epimetheus, running across the
room, "I will help you!"</p>

<p>So, with one consent, the two children
again lifted the lid. Out flew a sunny
and smiling little personage, and hovered
about the room, throwing a light wherever
she went. Have you never made
the sunshine dance into the dark corners
by reflecting it from a bit of looking-glass?
Well, so looked the winged cheerfulness
of this fairy-like stranger amid
the gloom of the cottage. She flew to
Epimetheus, and laid the least touch
of her finger on the inflamed spot where
the Trouble had stung him, and immediately
the anguish of it was gone. Then
she kissed Pandora on the forehead, and
her hurt was cured likewise.</p>

<p>After performing these good offices,
the bright stranger fluttered sportively
over the children's heads, and looked
so sweetly at them, that they both
began to think it not so very much
amiss to have opened the box, since,
otherwise, their cheery guest must have
been kept a prisoner among those
naughty imps with stings in their tails.</p>

<p>"Pray, who are you, beautiful creature?"
inquired Pandora.</p>

<p>"I am to be called Hope!" answered
the sunshiny figure. "And because I
am such a cheery little body, I was
packed into the box to make amends
to the human race for that swarm
of ugly Troubles which was destined
to be let loose among them. Never
fear! we shall do pretty well, in spite of
them all."</p>

<p>"Your wings are colored like the rainbow!"
exclaimed Pandora. "How very
beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Yes, they are like the rainbow," said
Hope, "because, glad as my nature is,
I am partly made of tears as well as
smiles."</p>

<p>"And will you stay with us," asked
Epimetheus, "forever and ever?"</p>

<p>"As long as you need me," said Hope,
with her pleasant smile,&mdash;"and that
will be as long as you live in the world,&mdash;I
promise never to desert you. There
may come times and seasons, now and
then, when you will think that I have
utterly vanished. But again, and again,
and again, when perhaps you least
dream of it, you shall see the glimmer
of my wings on the ceiling of your
cottage. Yes, my dear children, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
I know something very good and
beautiful that is to be given you hereafter!"</p>

<p>"Oh, tell us," they exclaimed&mdash;"tell us
what it is!"</p>

<p>"Do not ask me," replied Hope, putting
her finger on her rosy mouth. "But
do not despair, even if it should never
happen while you live on this earth.
Trust in my promise, for it is true."</p>

<p>"We do trust you!" cried Epimetheus
and Pandora, both in one breath.</p>

<p>And so they did; and not only they,
but so has everybody trusted Hope, that
has since been alive. And, to tell you
the truth, I cannot help being glad&mdash;(though,
to be sure, it was an uncommonly
naughty thing for her to do)&mdash;but
I cannot help being glad that our
foolish Pandora peeped into the box.
No doubt&mdash;no doubt&mdash;the Troubles are
still flying about the world, and have
increased in multitude, rather than lessened,
and are a very ugly set of imps,
and carry most venomous stings in their
tails. I have felt them already, and
expect to feel them more as I grow
older. But then that lovely and lightsome
little figure of Hope! What in
the world could we do without her?
Hope spiritualizes the earth; Hope
makes it always new; and, even in the
earth's best and brightest aspect, Hope
shows it to be only the shadow of an
infinite bliss hereafter!</p>

<div class="hang1">"The Miraculous Pitcher," taken from <i>A
Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys</i>, is Hawthorne's

and Philemon. The two mysterious visitors
are Jupiter and Mercury, who, according
to the Greek myth, visited earth in
disguise and were entertained by Baucis
and Philemon.</div>


<h4><br />THE MIRACULOUS PITCHER</h4>

<div class='center'>NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</div>

<p>One evening, in times long ago, old
Philemon and his old wife Baucis sat at
their cottage door, enjoying the calm
and beautiful sunset. They had already
eaten their frugal supper, and intended
now to spend a quiet hour or two before
bedtime. So they talked together about
their garden and their cow, and their
bees, and their grape-vine, which clambered
over the cottage-wall, and on which
the grapes were beginning to turn purple.
But the rude shouts of children and the
fierce barking of dogs, in the village near
at hand, grew louder and louder, until,
at last, it was hardly possible for Baucis
and Philemon to hear each other speak.</p>

<p>"Ah, wife," cried Philemon, "I fear
some poor traveler is seeking hospitality
among our neighbors yonder, and, instead
of giving him food and lodging, they
have set their dogs at him, as their custom
is!"</p>

<p>"Well-a-day!" answered old Baucis,
"I do wish our neighbors felt a little
more kindness for their fellow-creatures.
And only think of bringing up their
children in this naughty way, and patting
them on the head when they fling stones
at strangers!"</p>

<p>"Those children will never come to
any good," said Philemon, shaking his
white head. "To tell you the truth,
wife, I should not wonder if some terrible
thing were to happen to all the people
in the village, unless they mend their
manners. But, as for you and me, so
long as Providence affords us a crust of
bread, let us be ready to give half to any
poor, homeless stranger that may come
along and need it."</p>

<p>"That's right, husband!" said Baucis.
"So we will!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>These old folks, you must know, were
quite poor, and had to work pretty hard
for a living. Old Philemon toiled diligently
in his garden, while Baucis was
always busy with her distaff, or making
a little butter and cheese with their cow's
milk, or doing one thing and another
about the cottage. Their food was seldom
anything but bread, milk, and vegetables,
with sometimes a portion of honey
from their beehive, and now and then a
bunch of grapes, that had ripened against
the cottage wall. But they were two of
the kindest old people in the world, and
would cheerfully have gone without their
dinners, any day, rather than refuse a
slice of their brown loaf, a cup of nice
milk, and a spoonful of honey, to the
weary traveler who might pause before
their door. They felt as if such guests
had a sort of holiness, and that they
ought, therefore, to treat them better and
more bountifully than their own selves.</p>

<p>Their cottage stood on a rising ground,
at some short distance from a village,
which lay in a hollow valley, that was
about half a mile in breadth. This
valley, in past ages, when the world was
new, had probably been the bed of a lake.
There, fishes had glided to and fro in
the depths, and water-weeds had grown
along the margin, and trees and hills had
seen their reflected images in the broad
and peaceful mirror. But, as the waters
subsided, men had cultivated the soil,
and built houses on it, so that it was now
a fertile spot, and bore no traces of the
ancient lake, except a very small brook,
which meandered through the midst of
the village, and supplied the inhabitants
with water. The valley had been dry
land so long that oaks had sprung up,
and grown great and high, and perished
with old age, and been succeeded by
others, as tall and stately as the first.
Never was there a prettier or more fruitful
valley. The very sight of the plenty
around them should have made the inhabitants
kind and gentle and ready to show
their gratitude to Providence by doing
good to their fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>But, we are sorry to say, the people of
this lovely village were not worthy to
dwell in a spot on which Heaven had
smiled so beneficently. They were a
very selfish and hard-hearted people, and
had no pity for the poor, nor sympathy
with the homeless. They would only
have laughed had anybody told them
that human beings owe a debt of love to
one another, because there is no other
method of paying the debt of love and
care which all of us owe to Providence.
You will hardly believe what I am going
to tell you. These naughty people taught
their children to be no better than themselves,
and used to clap their hands, by
way of encouragement, when they saw
the little boys and girls run after some
poor stranger, shouting at his heels, and
pelting him with stones. They kept
large and fierce dogs, and whenever a
traveler ventured to show himself in the
village street, this pack of disagreeable
curs scampered to meet him, barking,
snarling, and showing their teeth. Then
they would seize him by his leg, or by his
clothes, just as it happened; and if he
were ragged when he came, he was generally
a pitiable object before he had time
to run away. This was a very terrible
thing to poor travelers, as you may suppose,
especially when they chanced to be
sick, or feeble, or lame, or old. Such
persons (if they once knew how badly
these unkind people, and their unkind
children and curs, were in the habit of
behaving) would go miles and miles out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of their way rather than try to pass
through the village again.</p>

<p>What made the matter seem worse, if
possible, was that when rich persons came
in their chariots, or riding on beautiful
horses, with their servants in rich liveries
attending on them, nobody could be
more civil and obsequious than the
inhabitants of the village. They would
take off their hats, and make the humblest
bows you ever saw. If the children were
rude, they were pretty certain to get their
ears boxed; and as for the dogs, if a single
cur in the pack presumed to yelp, his
master instantly beat him with a club,
and tied him up without any supper.
This would have been all very well, only
it proved that the villagers cared much
about the money that a stranger had in
his pocket, and nothing whatever for
the human soul, which lives equally in
the beggar and the prince.</p>

<p>So now you can understand why old
Philemon spoke so sorrowfully when he
heard the shouts of the children and the
barking of the dogs at the further extremity
of the village street. There was a
confused din, which lasted a good while,
and seemed to pass quite through the
breadth of the valley.</p>

<p>"I never heard the dogs so loud!" observed
the good old man.</p>

<p>"Nor the children so rude!" answered
his good old wife.</p>

<p>They sat shaking their heads, one to
another, while the noise came nearer
and nearer; until, at the foot of the little
eminence on which their cottage stood,
they saw two travelers approaching on
foot. Close behind them came the fierce
dogs, snarling at their very heels. A
little farther off, ran a crowd of children,
who sent up shrill cries, and flung stones
at the two strangers, with all their might.
Once or twice, the younger of the two
men (he was a slender and very active
figure) turned about, and drove back the
dogs with a staff which he carried in his
hand. His companion, who was a very
tall person, walked calmly along, as if
disdaining to notice either the naughty
children or the pack of curs, whose manners
the children seemed to imitate.</p>

<p>Both of the travelers were very humbly
clad, and looked as if they might not
have money enough in their pockets to
pay for a night's lodging. And this, I
am afraid, was the reason why the villagers
had allowed their children and dogs
to treat them so rudely.</p>

<p>"Come, wife," said Philemon to Baucis,
"let us go and meet these poor people.
No doubt they feel almost too heavy-hearted
to climb the hill."</p>

<p>"Go you and meet them," answered
Baucis, "while I make haste within doors
and see whether we can get them anything
for supper. A comfortable bowl
of bread and milk would do wonders
towards raising their spirits."</p>

<p>Accordingly, she hastened into the cottage.
Philemon, on his part, went forward
and extended his hand with so
hospitable an aspect that there was no
need of saying, what nevertheless he did
say, in the heartiest tone imaginable,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Welcome, strangers! welcome!"</p>

<p>"Thank you!" replied the younger of
the two, in a lively kind of way, notwithstanding
his weariness and trouble.
"This is quite another greeting than we
have met with yonder, in the village.
Pray, why do you live in such a bad
neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"Ah," observed old Philemon, with a
quiet and benign smile, "Providence put
me here, I hope, among other reasons,
in order that I may make you what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
amends I can for the inhospitality of my
neighbors."</p>

<p>"Well said, old father!" said the traveler,
laughing; "and, if the truth must be
told, my companion and myself need
some amends. Those children (the little
rascals!) have bespattered us finely with
their mud-balls; and one of the curs has
torn my cloak, which was ragged enough
already. But I took him across the
muzzle with my staff; and I think you
may have heard him yelp, even thus far
off."</p>

<p>Philemon was glad to see him in such
good spirits; nor, indeed, would you have
fancied, by the traveler's look and manner,
that he was weary with a long day's
journey, besides being disheartened by
rough treatment at the end of it. He
was dressed in rather an odd way, with a
sort of cap on his head, the brim of which
stuck out over both ears. Though it was
a summer evening, he wore a cloak,
which he kept wrapt closely about him,
perhaps because his under garments were
shabby. Philemon perceived, too, that
he had on a singular pair of shoes; but, as
it was now growing dusk, and as the old
man's eyesight was none the sharpest, he
could not precisely tell in what the
strangeness consisted. One thing, certainly,
seemed queer. The traveler was
so wonderfully light and active, that it
appeared as if his feet sometimes rose
from the ground of their own accord, or
could only be kept down by an effort.</p>

<p>"I used to be light-footed, in my
youth," said Philemon to the traveler.
"But I always found my feet grow heavier
towards nightfall."</p>

<p>"There is nothing like a good staff to
help one along," answered the stranger;
"and I happen to have an excellent one,
as you see."</p>

<p>This staff, in fact, was the oddest-looking
staff that Philemon had ever
beheld. It was made of olive-wood, and
had something like a little pair of wings
near the top. Two snakes, carved in the
wood, were represented as twining themselves
about the staff, and were so very
skillfully executed that old Philemon
(whose eyes, you know, were getting
rather dim) almost thought them alive,
and that he could see them wriggling and
twisting.</p>

<p>"A curious piece of work, sure enough!"
said he. "A staff with wings! It would
be an excellent kind of stick for a little
boy to ride astride of!"</p>

<p>By this time, Philemon and his two
guests had reached the cottage door.</p>

<p>"Friends," said the old man, "sit down
and rest yourselves here on this bench.
My good wife Baucis has gone to see
what you can have for supper. We are
poor folks; but you shall be welcome to
whatever we have in the cupboard."</p>

<p>The younger stranger threw himself
carelessly on the bench, letting his staff
fall as he did so. And here happened
something rather marvelous, though
trifling enough, too. The staff seemed to
get up from the ground of its own accord,
and, spreading its little pair of wings, it
half hopped, half flew, and leaned itself
against the wall of the cottage. There
it stood quite still, except that the snakes
continued to wriggle. But, in my private
opinion, old Philemon's eyesight had been
playing him tricks again.</p>

<p>Before he could ask any questions, the
elder stranger drew his attention from
the wonderful staff by speaking to him.</p>

<p>"Was there not," asked the stranger,
in a remarkably deep tone of voice, "a
lake, in very ancient times, covering the
spot where now stands yonder village?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not in my day, friend," answered
Philemon; "and yet I am an old man, as
you see. There were always the fields
and meadows, just as they are now, and
the old trees, and the little stream murmuring
through the midst of the valley.
My father, nor his father before him, ever
saw it otherwise, so far as I know; and
doubtless it will still be the same when
old Philemon shall be gone and forgotten!"</p>

<p>"That is more than can be safely foretold,"
observed the stranger; and there
was something very stern in his deep
voice. He shook his head, too, so that
his dark and heavy curls were shaken
with the movement. "Since the inhabitants
of yonder village have forgotten the
affections and sympathies of their nature,
it were better that the lake should be
rippling over their dwellings again!"</p>

<p>The traveler looked so stern that
Philemon was really almost frightened;
the more so, that, at his frown, the twilight
seemed suddenly to grow darker,
and that, when he shook his head, there
was a roll as of thunder in the air.</p>

<p>But, in a moment afterwards, the
stranger's face became so kindly and mild
that the old man quite forgot his terror.
Nevertheless, he could not help feeling
that this elder traveler must be no ordinary
personage, although he happened
now to be attired so humbly, and to be
journeying on foot. Not that Philemon
fancied him a prince in disguise, or any
character of that sort; but rather some
exceedingly wise man, who went about
the world in this poor garb, despising
wealth and all worldly objects, and seeking
everywhere to add a mite to his wisdom.
This idea appeared the more
probable, because, when Philemon raised
his eyes to the stranger's face, he seemed
to see more thought there, in one look,
than he could have studied out in a lifetime.</p>

<p>While Baucis was getting the supper,
the travelers both began to talk very
sociably with Philemon. The younger,
indeed, was extremely loquacious, and
made such shrewd and witty remarks,
that the good old man continually burst
out a-laughing, and pronounced him the
merriest fellow whom he had seen for
many a day.</p>

<p>"Pray, my young friend," said he, as
they grew familiar together, "what may
I call your name?"</p>

<p>"Why, I am very nimble, as you see,"
answered the traveler. "So, if you call
me Quicksilver, the name will fit tolerably
well."</p>

<p>"Quicksilver? Quicksilver!" repeated
Philemon, looking in the traveler's face,
to see if he were making fun of him.
"It is a very odd name! And your companion
there? Has he as strange a one?"</p>

<p>"You must ask the thunder to tell you
it!" replied Quicksilver, putting on a
mysterious look. "No other voice is
loud enough."</p>

<p>This remark, whether it were serious
or in jest, might have caused Philemon to
conceive a very great awe of the elder
stranger, if, on venturing to gaze at him,
he had not beheld so much beneficence in
his visage. But, undoubtedly, here was
the grandest figure that ever sat so humbly
beside a cottage door. When the
stranger conversed, it was with gravity,
and in such a way that Philemon felt
irresistibly moved to tell him everything
which he had most at heart. This is
always the feeling that people have, when
they meet with any one wise enough to
comprehend all their good and evil, and
to despise not a tittle of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>But Philemon, simple and kind-hearted
old man that he was, had not many
secrets to disclose. He talked, however,
quite garrulously, about the events of
his past life, in the whole course of which
he had never been a score of miles from
this very spot. His wife Baucis and
himself had dwelt in the cottage from
their youth upward, earning their bread
by honest labor, always poor, but still
contented. He told what excellent butter
and cheese Baucis made and how nice
were the vegetables which he raised in his
garden. He said, too, that, because they
loved one another so very much, it was
the wish of both that death might not
separate them, but that they should die,
as they had lived, together.</p>

<p>As the stranger listened, a smile beamed
over his countenance, and made its
expression as sweet as it was grand.</p>

<p>"You are a good old man," said he to
Philemon, "and you have a good old
wife to be your helpmeet. It is fit that
your wish be granted."</p>

<p>And it seemed to Philemon, just then,
as if the sunset clouds threw up a bright
flash from the west, and kindled a sudden
light in the sky.</p>

<p>Baucis had now got supper ready, and
coming to the door, began to make apologies
for the poor fare which she was
forced to set before her guests.</p>

<p>"Had we known you were coming,"
said she, "my good man and myself
would have gone without a morsel,
rather than you should lack a better supper.
But I took the most part of to-day's
milk to make cheese; and our last loaf is
already half eaten. Ah me! I never feel
the sorrow of being poor, save when a
poor traveler knocks at our door."</p>

<p>"All will be very well; do not trouble
yourself, my good dame," replied the
elder stranger, kindly. "An honest
hearty welcome to a guest works miracles
with the fare, and is capable of turning
the coarsest food to nectar and
ambrosia."</p>

<p>"A welcome you shall have," cried
Baucis, "and likewise a little honey that
we happen to have left, and a bunch of
purple grapes besides."</p>

<p>"Why, Mother Baucis, it is a feast!"
exclaimed Quicksilver, laughing, "an
absolute feast! And you shall see how
bravely I will play my part at it! I
think I never felt hungrier in my life."</p>

<p>"Mercy on us!" whispered Baucis to
her husband. "If the young man has
such a terrible appetite, I am afraid there
will not be half enough supper!"</p>

<p>They all went into the cottage.</p>

<p>And now, my little auditors, shall I
tell you something that will make you
open your eyes very wide? It is really
one of the oddest circumstances in the
whole story. Quicksilver's staff, you
recollect, had set itself up against the wall
of the cottage. Well, when its master
entered the door, leaving this wonderful
staff behind, what should it do but immediately
spread its little wings, and go
hopping and fluttering up the doorsteps!
Tap, tap, went the staff, on the kitchen
floor; nor did it rest until it had stood
itself on end, with the greatest gravity
and decorum, beside Quicksilver's chair.
Old Philemon, however, as well as his
wife, was so taken up in attending to
their guests, that no notice was given to
what the staff had been about.</p>

<p>As Baucis had said, there was but a
scanty supper for two hungry travelers.
In the middle of the table was the remnant
of a brown loaf, with a piece of
cheese on one side of it, and a dish of
honeycomb on the other. There was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
pretty good bunch of grapes for each of
the guests. A moderately sized earthen
pitcher, nearly full of milk, stood at a
corner of the board; and when Baucis
had filled two bowls, and set them before
the strangers, only a little milk remained
in the bottom of the pitcher. Alas! it is
a very sad business, when a bountiful
heart finds itself pinched and squeezed
among narrow circumstances. Poor
Baucis kept wishing that she might starve
for a week to come, if it were possible, by
so doing, to provide these hungry folks
a more plentiful supper.</p>

<p>And, since the supper was so exceedingly
small, she could not help wishing
that their appetites had not been quite
so large. Why, at their very first sitting
down, the travelers both drank off all the
milk in their two bowls, at a draught.</p>

<p>"A little more milk, kind Mother
Baucis, if you please," said Quicksilver.
"The day has been hot, and I am very
much athirst."</p>

<p>"Now, my dear people," answered
Baucis, in great confusion, "I am so sorry
and ashamed! But the truth is, there is
hardly a drop more milk in the pitcher.
O husband! husband! why didn't we go
without our supper?"</p>

<p>"Why, it appears to me," cried Quicksilver,
starting up from the table and
taking the pitcher by the handle, "it
really appears to me that matters are
not quite so bad as you represent them.
Here is certainly more milk in the
pitcher."</p>

<p>So saying, and to the vast astonishment
of Baucis, he proceeded to fill, not
only his own bowl, but his companion's
likewise, from the pitcher, that was supposed
to be almost empty. The good
woman could scarcely believe her eyes.
She had certainly poured out nearly all
the milk, and had peeped in afterwards,
and seen the bottom of the pitcher, as
she set it down upon the table.</p>

<p>"But I am old," thought Baucis to
herself, "and apt to be forgetful. I suppose
I must have made a mistake. At
all events, the pitcher cannot help being
empty now, after filling the bowls twice
over."</p>

<p>"What excellent milk!" observed
Quicksilver, after quaffing the contents
of the second bowl. "Excuse me, my
kind hostess, but I must really ask you
for a little more."</p>

<p>Now Baucis had seen, as plainly as she
could see anything, that Quicksilver had
turned the pitcher upside down, and consequently
had poured out every drop of
milk, in filling the last bowl. Of course,
there could not possibly be any left.
However, in order to let him know precisely
how the case was, she lifted the
pitcher, and made a gesture as if pouring
milk into Quicksilver's bowl, but without
the remotest idea that any milk would
stream forth. What was her surprise,
therefore, when such an abundant cascade
fell bubbling into the bowl, that it
was immediately filled to the brim, and
overflowed upon the table! The two
snakes that were twisted about Quicksilver's
staff (but neither Baucis nor
Philemon happened to observe this circumstance)
stretched out their heads,
and began to lap up the spilt milk.</p>

<p>And then what a delicious fragrance
the milk had! It seemed as if Philemon's
only cow must have pastured, that day,
on the richest herbage that could be
found anywhere in the world. I only
wish that each of you, my beloved little
souls, could have a bowl of such nice
milk at supper-time!</p>

<p>"And now a slice of your brown loaf,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Mother Baucis," said Quicksilver, "and
a little of that honey!"</p>

<p>Baucis cut him a slice, accordingly;
and though the loaf, when she and her
husband ate of it, had been rather too
dry and crusty to be palatable, it was
now as light and moist as if but a few
hours out of the oven. Tasting a crumb,
which had fallen on the table, she found
it more delicious than bread ever was
before, and could hardly believe that it
was a loaf of her own kneading and baking.
Yet, what other loaf could it possibly
be?</p>

<p>But, oh, the honey! I may just as
well let it alone, without trying to describe
how exquisitely it smelt and looked.
Its color was that of the purest and most
transparent gold; and it had the odor of
a thousand flowers; but of such flowers
as never grew in an earthly garden, and
to seek which the bees must have flown
high above the clouds. The wonder is,
that, after alighting on a flower-bed of so
delicious fragrance and immortal bloom,
they should have been content to fly
down again to their hive in Philemon's
garden. Never was such honey tasted,
seen, or smelt. The perfume floated
around the kitchen, and made it so delightful,
that, had you closed your eyes,
you would instantly have forgotten the
low ceiling and smoky walls, and have
fancied yourself in an arbor, with celestial
honeysuckles creeping over it.</p>

<p>Although good Mother Baucis was a
simple old dame, she could not but think
that there was something rather out of
the common way in all that had been
going on. So, after helping the guests
to bread and honey, and laying a bunch
of grapes by each of their plates, she sat
down by Philemon, and told him what
she had seen, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear the like?" asked
she.</p>

<p>"No, I never did," answered Philemon,
with a smile. "And I rather think, my
dear old wife, you have been walking
about in a sort of a dream. If I
had poured out the milk, I should have
seen through the business at once.
There happened to be a little more in
the pitcher than you thought,&mdash;that
is all."</p>

<p>"Ah, husband," said Baucis, "say what
you will, these are very uncommon
people."</p>

<p>"Well, well," replied Philemon, still
smiling, "perhaps they are. They certainly
do look as if they had seen better
days; and I am heartily glad to see them
making so comfortable a supper."</p>

<p>Each of the guests had now taken his
bunch of grapes upon his plate. Baucis
(who rubbed her eyes, in order to see the
more clearly) was of opinion that the
clusters had grown larger and richer, and
that each separate grape seemed to be
on the point of bursting with ripe juice.
It was entirely a mystery to her how such
grapes could ever have been produced
from the old stunted vine that climbed
against the cottage wall.</p>

<p>"Very admirable grapes, these!" observed
Quicksilver, as he swallowed one
after another, without apparently diminishing
his cluster. "Pray, my good host,
whence did you gather them?"</p>

<p>"From my own vine," answered Philemon.
"You may see one of its branches
twisting across the window, yonder.
But wife and I never thought the grapes
very fine ones."</p>

<p>"I never tasted better," said the guest.
"Another cup of this delicious milk, if
you please, and I shall then have supped
better than a prince."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>This time, old Philemon bestirred himself,
and took up the pitcher; for he was
curious to discover whether there was
any reality in the marvels which Baucis
had whispered to him. He knew that
his good old wife was incapable of falsehood,
and that she was seldom mistaken
in what she supposed to be true; but this
was so very singular a case that he
wanted to see into it with his own eyes.
On taking up the pitcher, therefore, he
slyly peeped into it, and was fully satisfied
that it contained not so much as a
single drop. All at once, however, he
beheld a little white fountain, which
gushed up from the bottom of the pitcher,
and speedily filled it to the brim
with foaming and deliciously fragrant
milk. It was lucky that Philemon, in
his surprise, did not drop the miraculous
pitcher from his hand.</p>

<p>"Who are ye, wonder-working strangers?"
cried he, even more bewildered
than his wife had been.</p>

<p>"Your guests, my good Philemon, and
your friends," replied the elder traveler,
in his mild, deep voice, that had something
at once sweet and awe-inspiring in
it. "Give me likewise a cup of the milk;
and may your pitcher never be empty
for kind Baucis and yourself, any more
than for the needy wayfarer!"</p>

<p>The supper being now over, the strangers
requested to be shown to their place
of repose. The old people would gladly
have talked with them a little longer,
and have expressed the wonder which
they felt, and their delight at finding the
poor and meager supper prove so much
better and more abundant than they
hoped. But the elder traveler had inspired
them with such reverence that
they dared not ask him any questions.
And when Philemon drew Quicksilver
aside, and inquired how under the sun
a fountain of milk could have got into
an old earthen pitcher, this latter personage
pointed to his staff.</p>

<p>"There is the whole mystery of the
affair," quoth Quicksilver; "and if you
can make it out, I'll thank you to let
me know. I can't tell what to make of
my staff. It is always playing such odd
tricks as this; sometimes getting me a
supper, and quite as often stealing it
away. If I had any faith in such nonsense,
I should say the stick was bewitched!"</p>

<p>He said no more, but looked so slyly
in their faces, that they rather fancied
he was laughing at them. The magic
staff went hopping at his heels, as Quicksilver
quitted the room. When left
alone, the good old couple spent some
little time in conversation about the
events of the evening, and then lay down
on the floor, and fell fast asleep. They
had given up their sleeping-room to the
guests, and had no other bed for themselves,
save these planks, which I wish
had been as soft as their own hearts.</p>

<p>The old man and his wife were stirring,
betimes, in the morning, and the strangers
likewise arose with the sun, and made
their preparations to depart. Philemon
hospitably entreated them to remain a
little longer, until Baucis could milk the
cow, and bake a cake upon the hearth,
and, perhaps, find them a few fresh eggs,
for breakfast. The guests, however,
seemed to think it better to accomplish
a good part of their journey before the
heat of the day should come on. They,
therefore, persisted in setting out immediately,
but asked Philemon and Baucis
to walk forth with them a short distance,
and show them the road which they were
to take.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>So they all four issued from the cottage,
chatting together like old friends.
It was very remarkable, indeed, how
familiar the old couple insensibly grew
with the elder traveler, and how their
good and simple spirits melted into his,
even as two drops of water would melt
into the illimitable ocean. And as for
Quicksilver, with his keen, quick, laughing
wits, he appeared to discover every
little thought that but peeped into their
minds, before they suspected it themselves.
They sometimes wished, it is
true, that he had not been quite so quick-witted,
and also that he would fling away
his staff, which looked so mysteriously
mischievous, with the snakes always
writhing about it. But then, again,
Quicksilver showed himself so very good-humored,
that they would have been
rejoiced to keep him in their cottage,
staff, snakes, and all, every day, and the
whole day long.</p>

<p>"Ah, me! Well-a-day!" exclaimed
Philemon, when they had walked a little
way from their door. "If our neighbors
only knew what a blessed thing it is to
show hospitality to strangers, they would
tie up all their dogs, and never allow
their children to fling another stone."</p>

<p>"It is a sin and shame for them to
behave so,&mdash;that it is!" cried good old
Baucis, vehemently. "And I mean to
go this very day and tell some of them
what naughty people they are!"</p>

<p>"I fear," remarked Quicksilver, slyly
smiling, "that you will find none of them
at home."</p>

<p>The elder traveler's brow, just then,
assumed such a grave, stern, and awful
grandeur, yet serene withal, that neither
Baucis nor Philemon dared to speak a
word. They gazed reverently into his
face, as if they had been gazing at the sky.</p>

<p>"When men do not feel towards
the humblest stranger as if he were a
brother," said the traveler, in tones so
deep they sounded like those of an organ,
"they are unworthy to exist on earth,
which was created as the abode of a great
human brotherhood!"</p>

<p>"And, by the by, my dear old people,"
cried Quicksilver, with the liveliest look
of fun and mischief in his eyes, "where
is this same village that you talk about?
On which side of us does it lie? Methinks
I do not see it hereabouts."</p>

<p>Philemon and his wife turned towards
the valley, where, at sunset, only the day
before, they had seen the meadows, the
houses, the gardens, the clumps of trees,
the wide, green-margined street, with
children playing in it, and all the tokens
of business, enjoyment, and prosperity.
But what was their astonishment! There
was no longer any appearance of a village!
Even the fertile vale, in the hollow of
which it lay, had ceased to have existence.
In its stead, they beheld the broad, blue
surface of a lake, which filled the great
basin of the valley from brim to brim,
and reflected the surrounding hills in its
bosom, with as tranquil an image as if
it had been there ever since the creation
of the world. For an instant, the lake
remained perfectly smooth. Then, a
little breeze sprang up, and caused the
water to dance, glitter, and sparkle in
the early sunbeams, and to dash, with a
pleasant rippling murmur, against the
hither shore.</p>

<p>The lake seemed so strangely familiar,
that the old couple were greatly perplexed,
and felt as if they could only have
been dreaming about a village having
lain there. But, the next moment, they
remembered the vanished dwellings,
and the faces and characters of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
inhabitants, far too distinctly for a
dream. The village had been there
yesterday, and now was gone!</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried these kind-hearted old
people, "what has become of our poor
neighbors!"</p>

<p>"They exist no longer as men and
women," said the elder traveler, in his
grand and deep voice, while a roll of
thunder seemed to echo it at a distance.
"There was neither use nor beauty in
such a life as theirs; for they never softened
or sweetened the hard lot of mortality
by the exercise of kindly affections
between man and man. They retained
no image of the better life in their bosoms:
therefore, the lake, that was of old,
has spread itself forth again, to reflect
the sky!"</p>

<p>"And as for those foolish people," said
Quicksilver, with his mischievous smile,
"they are all transformed to fishes.
There needed but little change, for they
were already a scaly set of rascals, and
the coldest-blooded beings in existence.
So, kind Mother Baucis, whenever you
or your husband have an appetite for a
dish of broiled trout, he can throw in a
line, and pull out half a dozen of your
old neighbors!"</p>

<p>"Ah," cried Baucis, shuddering, "I
would not, for the world, put one of them
on the gridiron!"</p>

<p>"No," added Philemon, making a wry
face, "we could never relish them!"</p>

<p>"As for you, good Philemon," continued
the elder traveler,&mdash;"and you,
kind Baucis,&mdash;you, with your scanty
means, have mingled so much heartfelt
hospitality with your entertainment of
the homeless stranger, that the milk
became an inexhaustible fount of nectar,
and the brown loaf and the honey were
ambrosia. Thus, the divinities have
feasted, at your board, off the same viands
that supply their banquets on Olympus.
You have done well, my dear old friends.
Wherefore, request whatever favor you
have most at heart, and it is granted."</p>

<p>Philemon and Baucis looked at one
another, and then,&mdash;I know not which of
the two it was who spoke, but that one
uttered the desire of both their hearts.</p>

<p>"Let us live together, while we live,
and leave the world at the same instant,
when we die! For we have always loved
one another!"</p>

<p>"Be it so!" replied the stranger, with
majestic kindness. "Now, look towards
your cottage!"</p>

<p>They did so. But what was their surprise
on beholding a tall edifice of white
marble, with a wide-open portal, occupying
the spot where their humble residence
had so lately stood!</p>

<p>"There is your home," said the
stranger, beneficently smiling on them
both. "Exercise your hospitality in yonder
palace as freely as in the poor hovel
to which you welcomed us last evening."</p>

<p>The old folks fell on their knees to
thank him; but, behold! neither he nor
Quicksilver was there.</p>

<p>So Philemon and Baucis took up their
residence in the marble palace, and spent
their time, with vast satisfaction to themselves,
in making everybody jolly and comfortable
who happened to pass that way.
The milk-pitcher, I must not forget to say,
retained its marvelous quality of being
never empty, when it was desirable to
have it full. Whenever an honest, good-humored,
and free-hearted guest took a
draught from this pitcher, he invariably
found it the sweetest and most invigorating
fluid that ever ran down his throat.
But, if a cross and disagreeable curmudgeon
happened to sip, he was pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
certain to twist his visage into a hard knot,
and pronounce it a pitcher of sour milk!</p>

<p>Thus the old couple lived in their
palace a great, great while, and grew older
and older, and very old indeed. At
length, however, there came a summer
morning when Philemon and Baucis
failed to make their appearance, as on
other mornings, with one hospitable smile
overspreading both their pleasant faces,
to invite the guests of over-night to breakfast.
The guests searched everywhere,
from top to bottom of the spacious
palace, and all to no purpose. But, after
a great deal of perplexity, they espied, in
front of the portal, two venerable trees,
which nobody could remember to have seen
there the day before. Yet there they
stood, with their roots fastened deep into
the soil, and a huge breadth of foliage overshadowing
the whole front of the edifice.
One was an oak, and the other a linden-tree.
Their boughs&mdash;it was strange
and beautiful to see&mdash;were intertwined
together, and embraced one another,
so that each tree seemed to live in the
other's bosom, much more than in its own.</p>

<p>While the guests were marveling how
these trees, that must have required at
least a century to grow, could have come
to be so tall and venerable in a single
night, a breeze sprang up, and set their
intermingled boughs astir. And then
there was a deep, broad murmur in the
air, as if the two mysterious trees were
speaking.</p>

<p>"I am old Philemon!" murmured the
oak.</p>

<p>"I am old Baucis!" murmured the
linden-tree.</p>

<p>But, as the breeze grew stronger, the
trees both spoke at once,&mdash;"Philemon!
Baucis! Baucis! Philemon!"&mdash;as if one
were both and both were one, and talking
together in the depths of their mutual
heart. It was plain enough to perceive
that the good old couple had renewed
their age, and were now to spend a quiet
and delightful hundred years or so,
Philemon as an oak, and Baucis as a
linden-tree. And oh, what a hospitable
shade did they fling around them! Whenever
a wayfarer paused beneath it, he
heard a pleasant whisper of the leaves
above his head, and wondered how the
sound should so much resemble words
like these:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Welcome, welcome, dear traveler,
welcome!"</p>

<p>And some kind soul, that knew what
would have pleased old Baucis and old
Philemon best, built a circular seat
around both their trunks, where, for a
great while afterwards, the weary, and
the hungry, and the thirsty used to repose
themselves, and quaff milk abundantly
out of the miraculous pitcher.</p>

<p>And I wish, for all our sakes, that we
had the pitcher here now!</p>

<div class="hang1">One of the very satisfactory attempts to

into a "single <i>saga</i>, free from inconsistencies

the book all the charm of a single story
made of many dramatic episodes. Francillon's
version of the familiar tale of
Narcissus and Echo follows by permission
of the publishers. (Copyright. Ginn &amp; Co.,

<h4><br />THE NARCISSUS</h4>

<div class='center'>R. E. FRANCILLON</div>

<p>There was a very beautiful nymph
named Echo, who had never, in all her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
life, seen anybody handsomer than the
god Pan. You have read that Pan was
the chief of all the Satyrs, and what
hideous monsters the Satyrs were. So,
when Pan made love to her, she very
naturally kept him at a distance: and,
as she supposed him to be no worse-looking
than the rest of the world, she
made up her mind to have nothing to
do with love or lovemaking, and was
quite content to ramble about the woods
all alone.</p>

<p>But one day, to her surprise, she
happened to meet with a young man
who was as different from Pan as any
creature could be. Instead of having a
goat's legs and long hairy arms, he
was as graceful as Apollo himself: no
horns grew out of his forehead, and his
ears were not long, pointed, and covered
with hair, but just like Echo's own.
And he was just as beautiful in face as
he was graceful in form. I doubt if
Echo would have thought even Apollo
himself so beautiful.</p>

<p>The nymphs were rather shy, and
Echo was the very shyest of them all.
But she admired him so much she could
not leave the spot, and at last she even
plucked up courage enough to ask him,
"What is the name of the most beautiful
being in the whole world?"</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean?" asked he.
"Yourself? If you want to know your
own name, you can tell it better than
I can."</p>

<p>"No," said Echo, "I don't mean myself.
I mean <i>you</i>. What is <i>your</i> name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Narcissus," said he.
"But as for my being beautiful&mdash;that
is absurd."</p>

<p>"Narcissus!" repeated Echo to herself.
"It is a beautiful name. Which
of the nymphs have you come to meet
here in these woods all alone? She is
lucky&mdash;whoever she may be."</p>

<p>"I have come to meet nobody," said
Narcissus. "But&mdash;am I really so beautiful?
I have often been told so by
other girls, of course; but really it is
more than I can quite believe."</p>

<p>"And you don't care for any of those
girls?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see," said Narcissus, "when
all the girls one knows call one beautiful,
there's no reason why I should care for
one more than another. They all seem
alike when they are all always saying
just the same thing. Ah! I do wish I
could see myself, so that I could tell
if it was really true. I would marry
the girl who could give me the wish of
my heart&mdash;to see myself as other people
see me. But as nobody can make me
do that, why, I suppose I shall get on
very well without marrying anybody
at all."</p>

<p>Looking-glasses had not been invented
in those days, so that Narcissus had
really never seen even so much of himself
as his chin.</p>

<p>"What!" cried Echo, full of hope and
joy; "if I make you see your own face,
you will marry <i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>"I said so," said he. "And of course
what I say I'll do, I'll do."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;come with me!"</p>

<p>Echo took him by the hand and led
him to the edge of a little lake in the
middle of the wood, full of clear water.</p>

<p>"Kneel down, Narcissus," said she,
"and bend your eyes over the waterside.
That lake is the mirror where
Diana comes every morning to dress
her hair, and in which, every night,
the moon and the stars behold themselves.
Look into that water, and see
what manner of man you are!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>Narcissus kneeled down and looked
into the lake. And, better than in
any common looking-glass, he saw the
reflected image of his own face&mdash;and
he looked, and looked, and could not
take his eyes away.</p>

<p>But Echo at last grew tired of waiting.
"Have you forgotten what you promised
me?" asked she. "Are you content
now? Do you see now that what I
told you is true?"</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes at last. "Oh,
beautiful creature that I am!" said he.
"I am indeed the most divine creature
in the whole wide world. I love myself
madly. Go away. I want to be with
my beautiful image, with myself, all alone.
I can't marry you. I shall never love
anybody but myself for the rest of my
days." And he kneeled down and gazed
at himself once more, while poor Echo
had to go weeping away.</p>

<p>Narcissus had spoken truly. He loved
himself and his own face so much that
he could think of nothing else: he spent
all his days and nights by the lake, and
never took his eyes away. But unluckily
his image, which was only a shadow in
the water, could not love him back
again. And so he pined away until he
died. And when his friends came to
look for his body, they found nothing
but a flower, into which his soul had
turned. So they called it the Narcissus,
and we call it so still. And yet I don't
know that it is a particularly conceited
or selfish flower.</p>

<p>As for poor Echo, she pined away
too. She faded and faded until nothing
was left of her but her voice. There
are many places where she can even
now be heard. And she still has the
same trick of saying to vain and foolish
people whatever they say to themselves,
or whatever they would like best to hear
said to them. If you go where Echo
is, and call out loudly, "I am beautiful!"&mdash;she
will echo your very words.</p>

<div class="hang1">"The Apple of Discord" is also taken, by
permission of the publishers, from Francillon's
<i>Gods and Heroes</i>. It is the story of
how the world's first great war was brought
about. Teachers who wish to use some of
the stories from Homer's <i>Iliad</i> might well
follow this story with some selected episodes
from that work. The prose translation of
the <i>Iliad</i> by Lang, Leaf, and Myers is the
most satisfactory. Of versions adapted
for children, Church's <i>Story of the Iliad</i>
has long been a favorite.</div>


<h4><br />THE APPLE OF DISCORD</h4>

<div class='center'>R. E. FRANCILLON</div>

<p>Never was such a wedding-feast known
as that of Peleus and Thetis. And no
wonder; for Peleus was King of Thessaly,
and Thetis was a goddess&mdash;the goddess
who keeps the gates of the West, and
throws them open for the chariot of the
Sun to pass through when its day's
journey is done.</p>

<p>Not only all the neighboring kings
and queens came to the feast, but the
gods and goddesses besides, bringing
splendid presents to the bride and
bridegroom. Only one goddess was not
there, because she had not been invited;
and she had not been invited for the
best of all reasons. Her name was Ate,
which means Mischief; and wherever
she went she caused quarreling and confusion.
Jupiter had turned her out of
heaven for setting even the gods by the
ears; and ever since then she had been
wandering about the earth, making mischief,
for they would not have her even
in Hades.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>"So they won't have <i>Me</i> at their
feast!" she said to herself, when she
heard the sound of the merriment to
which she had not been bidden. "Very
well; they shall be sorry. I see a way
to make a bigger piece of mischief than
ever was known."</p>

<p>So she took a golden apple, wrote
some words upon it, and, keeping herself
out of sight, threw it into the very
middle of the feasters, just when they
were most merry.</p>

<p>Nobody saw where the apple came
from; but of course they supposed it
had been thrown among them for frolic;
and one of the guests, taking it up, read
aloud the words written on it. The
words were:</p>

<div class='center'>
"FOR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL!"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>&mdash;nothing more.</div>

<p>"What a handsome present somebody
has sent me!" said Juno, holding out
her hand for the apple.</p>

<p>"Sent <i>you?</i>" asked Diana. "What
an odd mistake, to be sure! Don't you
see it is for the most beautiful? I will
thank you to hand me what is so clearly
intended for <i>Me</i>."</p>

<p>"You seem to forget <i>I</i> am present!"
said Vesta, making a snatch at the
apple.</p>

<p>"Not at all!" said Ceres; "only I
happen to be here, too. And who
doubts that where I am there is the
most beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Except where <i>I</i> am," said Proserpine.</p>

<p>"What folly is all this!" said Minerva,
the wise. "Wisdom is the only true
beauty; and everybody knows that I am
the wisest of you all."</p>

<p>"But it's for the <i>most</i> beautiful!" said
Venus. "The idea of its being for anybody
but <i>Me!</i>"</p>

<p>Then every nymph and goddess present,
and even every woman, put in her
claim, until from claiming and disputing
it grew to arguing and wrangling and
downright quarreling: insults flew about,
until the merriment grew into an angry
din, the like of which had never been
heard. But as it became clear that it
was impossible for everybody to be the
most beautiful, the claimants gradually
settled down into three parties&mdash;some
taking the side of Venus, others of Juno,
others of Minerva.</p>

<p>"We shall never settle it among ourselves,"
said one, when all were fairly
out of breath with quarreling. "Let the
gods decide."</p>

<p>For the gods had been silent all the
while; and now they looked at one
another in dismay at such an appeal.
Jupiter, in his heart, thought Venus the
most beautiful; but how could he dare
decide against either his wife Juno or his
daughter Minerva? Neptune hated
Minerva on account of their old quarrel;
but it was awkward to choose between his
daughter Venus and his sister Juno, of
whose temper he, as well as Jupiter,
stood in awe. Mars was ready enough
to vote for Venus; but then he was afraid
of a scandal. And so with all the gods&mdash;not
one was bold enough to decide on
such a terrible question as the beauty of
three rival goddesses who were ready to
tear out each other's eyes. For Juno
was looking like a thundercloud, and
Minerva like lightning, and Venus like a
smiling but treacherous sea.</p>

<p>"I have it," said Jupiter at last.
"Men are better judges of beauty than
the gods are, who never see anything but
its perfection. King Priam of Troy has
a son named Paris, whose judgment as a
critic I would take even before my own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
I propose that you, Juno, and you,
Minerva, and you, Venus, shall go
together before Paris and submit yourselves
to his decision, whatever it
may be."</p>

<p>And so it was settled, for each of the
three goddesses was equally sure that,
whoever the judge might be, the golden
apple was safe to be hers. The quarrel
came to an end, and the feast ended
pleasantly; but Ate, who had been watching
and listening, laughed in her sleeve.</p>

<p>Troy, where King Priam reigned, was a
great and ancient city on the shore of
Asia: it was a sacred city, whose walls
had been built by Neptune, and it possessed
the Palladium, the image of
Minerva, which kept it from all harm.
Priam&mdash;who had been the friend of Hercules&mdash;and
his wife Hecuba had many
sons and daughters, all brave and noble
princes and beautiful princesses; and of
his sons, while the bravest and noblest
was his first-born, Hector, the handsomest
and most amiable was Paris,
whom Jupiter had appointed to be the
judge of beauty.</p>

<p>Paris, unlike his brothers, cared nothing
for affairs of State, but lived as a
shepherd upon Mount Ida with his wife
Oenone, a nymph of that mountain, in
perfect happiness and peace, loved and
honored by the whole country round,
which had given him the name of "Alexander,"
which means "The Helper."
One would think that if anybody was safe
from the mischief of Ate, it was he.</p>

<p>But one day, while he was watching
his flocks and thinking of Oenone, there
came to him what he took for three
beautiful women&mdash;the most beautiful he
had ever seen. Yet something told him
they were more than mere women, or
even than Oreads, before the tallest said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is debate in Olympus which
is the most beautiful of us three, and
Jupiter has appointed you to be the
judge between us. I am Juno, the
queen of gods and men, and if you
decide for me, I will make you king
of the whole world."</p>

<p>"And I," said the second, "am
Minerva, and you shall know everything
in the whole universe if you decide
for me."</p>

<p>"But I," said the third, "am Venus,
who can give neither wisdom nor power;
but if you decide for me, I will give you
the love of the most beautiful woman
that ever was or ever will be born."</p>

<p>Paris looked from one to the other,
wondering to which he should award the
golden apple, the prize of beauty. He
did not care for power; he would be
quite content to rule his sheep, and even
that was not always easy. Nor did he
care for wisdom or knowledge: he had
enough for all his needs. Nor ought he
to have desired any love but Oenone's.
But then Venus was really the most
beautiful of all the goddesses&mdash;the very
goddess of beauty; no mortal could
refuse anything she asked him, so great
was her charm. So he took the apple
and placed it in the hands of Venus
without a word, while Juno and Minerva
departed in a state of wrath with Paris,
Venus, and each other, which made Ate
laugh to herself more than ever.</p>

<p>Now the most beautiful woman in the
whole world was Helen, step-daughter
of King Tyndarus of Sparta, and sister
of Castor and Pollux: neither before her
nor after her has there been any to
compare with her for beauty. Thirty-one
of the noblest princes in Greece
came to her father's Court at the same
time to seek her in marriage, so that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Tyndarus knew not what to do, seeing
that, whomsoever he chose for his son-in-law,
he would make thirty powerful
enemies. The most famous among them
were Ulysses, King of the island of Ithaca;
Diomed, King of Aetolia; Ajax, King of
Salamis, the bravest and strongest man
in Greece; his brother Teucer; Philoctetes,
the friend of Hercules; and
Menelaus, King of Sparta. At last, as
there was no other way of deciding among
them, an entirely new idea occurred to
Ulysses&mdash;namely, that Helen should be
allowed to choose her own husband
herself, and that, before she chose, all
the rival suitors should make a great
and solemn oath to approve her choice,
and to defend her and her husband
against all enemies thenceforth and
forever. This oath they all took loyally
and with one accord, and Helen chose
Menelaus, King of Sparta, who married
her with great rejoicing, and took her
away to his kingdom.</p>

<p>And all would have gone well but for
that wretched apple. For Venus was
faithful to her promise that the most
beautiful of all women should be the
wife of Paris: and so Menelaus, returning
from a journey, found that a Trojan
prince had visited his Court during his
absence, and had gone away, taking
Helen with him to Troy. This Trojan
prince was Paris, who, seeing Helen, had
forgotten Oenone, and could think of
nothing but her whom Venus had
given him.</p>

<p>Then, through all Greece and all the
islands, went forth the summons of
King Menelaus, reminding the thirty
princes of their great oath: and each
and all of them, and many more, came
to the gathering-place with all their
ships and all their men, to help Menelaus
and to bring back Helen. Such a host
as gathered together at Aulis had never
been seen since the world began; there
were nearly twelve hundred ships and
more than a hundred thousand men:
it was the first time that all the Greeks
joined together in one cause. There,
besides those who had come for their
oath's sake, were Nestor, the old King
of Pylos&mdash;so old that he remembered
Jason and the Golden Fleece, but, at
ninety years old, as ready for battle as
the youngest there; and Achilles, the
son of Peleus and Thetis, scarcely more
than a boy, but fated to outdo the deeds
of the bravest of them all. The kings
and princes elected Agamemnon, King
of Mycenae and Argos, and brother of
Menelaus, to be their general-in-chief;
and he forthwith sent a herald to Troy
to demand the surrender of Helen.</p>

<p>But King Priam was indignant that
these chiefs of petty kingdoms should
dare to threaten the sacred city of
Troy: and he replied to the demand by
a scornful challenge, and by sending
out his summons also to his friends and
allies. And it was as well answered as
that of Menelaus had been. There came
to his standard Rhesus, with a great army
from Thrace; and Sarpedon, the greatest
king in all Asia; and Memnon, king of
Aethiopia, with twenty thousand men&mdash;the
hundred thousand Greeks were not
so many as the army of Priam. Then
Agamemnon gave the order to sail for
Troy: and Ate laughed aloud, for her
apple had brought upon mankind the
First Great War.</p>

<div class="hang1">The little book of <i>Old Greek Folk Stories</i>, by
Josephine P. Peabody, is especially valuable,
not only for its fine versions of many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the more interesting myths, but because it
supplements the dozen retold by Hawthorne
in his <i>Wonder-Book</i> and <i>Tanglewood Tales</i>.
The two stories that follow are taken from
that book and are used by permission of

(Copyright: Houghton Mifflin
Co., Boston.) It is worth noticing that
the idea of being able to fly through the
air successfully is found in a very remote
past, and that Daedalus discarded his
invention because of the tragedy related
below. Only a few years since, most people
looked upon one who tried to work out
practically the problem of flying as somewhat
"short" mentally. Hence the use
of such efforts for comic effect as in "Darius
Green and His Flying Machine" (No. <a href="#Note_375">375</a>).</div>


<h4><br />ICARUS AND DAEDALUS</h4>

<div class='center'>JOSEPHINE PRESTON PEABODY</div>

<p>Among all those mortals who grew
so wise that they learned the secrets of
the gods, none was more cunning than
Daedalus.</p>

<p>He once built, for King Minos of Crete,
a wonderful Labyrinth of winding ways
so cunningly tangled up and twisted
around that, once inside, you could
never find your way out again without
a magic clue. But the king's favor
veered with the wind, and one day he
had his master architect imprisoned in
a tower. Daedalus managed to escape
from his cell; but it seemed impossible
to leave the island, since every ship that
came or went was well guarded by order
of the king.</p>

<p>At length, watching the sea gulls in
the air,&mdash;the only creatures that were
sure of liberty,&mdash;he thought of a plan
for himself and his young son Icarus,
who was captive with him.</p>

<p>Little by little, he gathered a store of
feathers great and small. He fastened
these together with thread, moulded
them in with wax, and so fashioned two
great wings like those of a bird. When
they were done, Daedalus fitted them
to his own shoulders, and after one or
two efforts, he found that by waving
his arms he could winnow the air and
cleave it, as a swimmer does the sea.
He held himself aloft, wavered this way
and that with the wind, and at last,
like a great fledgling, he learned to fly.</p>

<p>Without delay, he fell to work on a
pair of wings for the boy Icarus, and
taught him carefully how to use them,
bidding him beware of rash adventures
among the stars. "Remember," said
the father, "never to fly very low or
very high, for the fogs about the earth
would weigh you down, but the blaze
of the sun will surely melt your feathers
apart if you go too near."</p>

<p>For Icarus, these cautions went in at
one ear and out by the other. Who
could remember to be careful when he
was to fly for the first time? Are birds
careful? Not they! And not an idea
remained in the boy's head but the one
joy of escape.</p>

<p>The day came, and the fair wind that
was to set them free. The father bird
put on his wings, and, while the light
urged them to be gone, he waited to see
that all was well with Icarus, for the two
could not fly hand in hand. Up they
rose, the boy after his father. The
hateful ground of Crete sank beneath
them; and the country folk, who caught
a glimpse of them when they were high
above the tree-tops, took it for a vision
of the gods,&mdash;Apollo, perhaps, with
Cupid after him.</p>

<p>At first there was a terror in the joy.
The wide vacancy of the air dazed them,&mdash;a
glance downward made their brains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
reel. But when a great wind filled their
wings, and Icarus felt himself sustained,
like a halcyon-bird in the hollow of a
wave, like a child uplifted by his mother,
he forgot everything in the world but
joy. He forgot Crete and the other
islands that he had passed over: he saw
but vaguely that winged thing in the
distance before him that was his father
Daedalus. He longed for one draught
of flight to quench the thirst of his
captivity: he stretched out his arms
to the sky and made towards the highest
heavens.</p>

<p>Alas for him! Warmer and warmer
grew the air. Those arms, that had
seemed to uphold him, relaxed. His
wings wavered, drooped. He fluttered
his young hands vainly,&mdash;he was falling,&mdash;and
in that terror he remembered.
The heat of the sun had melted the wax
from his wings; the feathers were falling,
one by one, like snowflakes; and there
was none to help.</p>

<p>He fell like a leaf tossed down the
wind, down, down, with one cry that
overtook Daedalus far away. When he
returned, and sought high and low for
the poor boy, he saw nothing but the
bird-like feathers afloat on the water,
and he knew that Icarus was drowned.</p>

<p>The nearest island he named Icaria,
in memory of the child; but he, in heavy
grief, went to the temple of Apollo in
Sicily, and there hung up his wings as
an offering. Never again did he attempt
to fly.</p>

<div class="hang1">This story of how Apollo, god of music and
poetry, was sent to earth for a space to
serve a mortal is also from <i>Old Greek Folk
Stories</i>, by arrangement with the publishers.
(Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston.)
James Russell Lowell wrote a very fine
poetic treatment of this same story
in "The Shepherd of King Admetus"
(No. <a href="#Note_373">373</a>).</div>


<h4><br />ADMETUS AND THE SHEPHERD</h4>

<div class='center'>JOSEPHINE PRESTON PEABODY</div>

<p>Apollo did not live always free of care,
though he was the most glorious of the
gods. One day, in anger with the
Cyclopes who work at the forges of Vulcan,
he sent his arrows after them, to
the wrath of all the gods, but especially
of Zeus. (For the Cyclopes always
make his thunderbolts, and make them
well.) Even the divine archer could
not go unpunished, and as a penalty he
was sent to serve some mortal for a
year. Some say one year and some say
nine, but in those days time passed
quickly; and as for the gods, they took
no heed of it.</p>

<p>Now there was a certain king in
Thessaly, Admetus by name, and there
came to him one day a stranger, who
asked leave to serve about the palace.
None knew his name, but he was very
comely, and moreover, when they questioned
him he said that he had come
from a position of high trust. So without
further delay they made him chief
shepherd of the royal flocks.</p>

<p>Every day thereafter, he drove his
sheep to the banks of the river Amphrysus,
and there he sat to watch them
browse. The country folk that passed
drew near to wonder at him, without
daring to ask questions. He seemed to
have a knowledge of leech-craft, and
knew how to cure the ills of any wayfarer
with any weed that grew near
by; and he would pipe for hours in the
sun. A simple-spoken man he was, yet
he seemed to know much more than he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
would say, and he smiled with a kindly
mirth when the people wished him
sunny weather.</p>

<p>Indeed, as days went by, it seemed as
if summer had come to stay, and, like
the shepherd, found the place friendly.
Nowhere else were the flocks so white
and fair to see, like clouds loitering along
a bright sky; and sometimes, when he
chose, their keeper sang to them. Then
the grasshoppers drew near and the
swans sailed close to the river banks,
and the countrymen gathered about to
hear wonderful tales of the slaying of the
monster Python, and of a king with ass's
ears, and of a lovely maiden, Daphne,
who grew into a laurel-tree. In time
the rumor of these things drew the king
himself to listen; and Admetus, who had
been to see the world in the ship Argo,
knew at once that this was no earthly
shepherd, but a god. From that day,
like a true king, he treated his guest
with reverence and friendliness, asking
no questions; and the god was well
pleased.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that Admetus
fell in love with a beautiful maiden,
Alcestis, and, because of the strange
condition that her father Pelias had
laid upon all suitors, he was heavy-hearted.
Only that man who should
come to woo her in a chariot drawn by
a wild boar and a lion might ever marry
Alcestis; and this task was enough to
puzzle even a king.</p>

<p>As for the shepherd, when he heard
of it he rose, one fine morning, and left
the sheep and went his way,&mdash;no one
knew whither. If the sun had gone out,
the people could not have been more
dismayed. The king himself went, late
in the day, to walk by the river Amphrysus,
and wonder if his gracious keeper
of the flocks had deserted him in a time
of need. But at that very moment,
whom should he see returning from the
woods but the shepherd, glorious as
sunset, and leading side by side a lion
and a boar, as gentle as two sheep!
The very next morning, with joy and
gratitude, Admetus set out in his chariot
for the kingdom of Pelias, and there he
wooed and won Alcestis, the most loving
wife that was ever heard of.</p>

<p>It was well for Admetus that he came
home with such a comrade, for the year
was at an end, and he was to lose his
shepherd. The strange man came to
take leave of the king and queen whom
he had befriended.</p>

<p>"Blessed be your flocks, Admetus,"
he said, smiling. "They shall prosper
even though I leave them. And, because
you can discern the gods that come to
you in the guise of wayfarers, happiness
shall never go far from your home, but
ever return to be your guest. No man
may live on earth forever, but this one
gift have I obtained for you. When
your last hour draws near, if any one
shall be willing to meet it in your stead,
he shall die, and you shall live on, more
than the mortal length of days. Such
kings deserve long life."</p>

<p>So ended the happy year when Apollo
tended sheep.</p>

Hawthorne's version of this favorite myth
may be found in his <i>Wonder-Book</i> as "The
Golden Touch."</div>


<h4><br />MIDAS</h4>

<p>Bacchus, on a certain occasion, found
his old schoolmaster and foster-father,
Silenus, missing. The old man had been
drinking, and in that state had wandered
away, and was found by some peasants,
who carried him to their king, Midas.
Midas recognized him and treated him
hospitably, entertaining him for ten
days and nights with an unceasing
round of jollity. On the eleventh day
he brought Silenus back, and restored
him in safety to his pupil. Whereupon
Bacchus offered Midas his choice of
whatever reward he might wish. He
asked that whatever he might touch
should be changed into <i>gold</i>. Bacchus
consented, though sorry that he had not
made a better choice.</p>

<p>Midas went his way, rejoicing in his
newly acquired power, which he hastened
to put to the test. He could scarce
believe his eyes when he found that a
twig of an oak, which he plucked from
the branch, became gold in his hand.
He took up a stone&mdash;it changed to gold.
He touched a sod&mdash;it did the same. He
took an apple from the tree&mdash;you would
have thought he had robbed the garden
of the Hesperides. His joy knew no
bounds, and as soon as he got home, he
ordered the servants to set a splendid
repast on the table. Then he found to
his dismay that whether he touched
bread, it hardened in his hand; or put
a morsel to his lips, it defied his teeth.
He took a glass of wine, but it flowed
down his throat like melted gold.</p>

<p>In consternation at the unprecedented
affliction, he strove to divest himself of
his power; he hated the gift he had
lately coveted. But all in vain; starvation
seemed to await him. He raised
his arms, all shining with gold, in prayer
to Bacchus, begging to be delivered from
his glittering destruction. Bacchus,
merciful deity, heard and consented.
"Go," said he, "to the River Pactolus,
trace the stream to its fountain-head,
there plunge in your head and body and
wash away your fault and its punishment."
He did so, and scarce had he
touched the waters before the gold-creating
power passed into them, and
the river sands became changed into
<i>gold</i>, as they remain to this day.</p>

<p>Thenceforth Midas, hating wealth and
splendor, dwelt in the country and
became a worshipper of Pan, the god
of the fields. On a certain occasion
Pan had the temerity to compare his
music with that of Apollo, and to challenge
the god of the lyre to a trial of
skill. The challenge was accepted; and
Tmolus, the mountain-god, was chosen
umpire. Tmolus took his seat and
cleared away the trees from his ears to
listen. At a given signal Pan blew on
his pipes, and with his rustic melody
gave great satisfaction to himself and his
faithful follower Midas, who happened
to be present. Then Tmolus turned
his head toward the sun-god, and all
his trees turned with him. Apollo rose,
his brow wreathed with Parnassian
laurel, while his robe of Tyrian purple
swept the ground. In his left hand he
held the lyre, and with his right hand
struck the strings. Ravished with the
harmony, Tmolus at once awarded the
victory to the god of the lyre, and all
but Midas acquiesced in the judgment.
He dissented, and questioned the justice
of the award. Apollo would not suffer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
such a depraved pair of ears any longer
to wear the human form, but caused
them to increase in length, grow hairy
within and without, and to become movable
on their roots; in short, to be on
the perfect pattern of those of an ass.</p>

<p>Mortified enough was King Midas at
this mishap; but he consoled himself
with the thought that it was possible to
hide his misfortune, which he attempted
to do by means of an ample turban
or headdress. But his hairdresser of
course knew the secret. He was charged
not to mention it, and threatened with
dire punishment if he presumed to disobey.
But he found it too much for
his discretion to keep such a secret; so
he went out into the meadow, dug a
hole in the ground, and stooping down,
whispered the story, and covered it up.
Before long a thick bed of reeds sprang
up in the meadow, and as soon as it
had gained its growth, began whispering
the story, and has continued to do
so, from that day to this, with every
breeze which passes over the place.</p>

<div class="hang1">The story of Pha&euml;thon is taken by permission
from Gayley's <i>Classic Myths in English
Literature and Art</i>. (Copyright. Ginn &amp;
Co., Boston.) Gayley is by all odds the
one handbook for the whole field of mythology
that teachers should always have
access to. Based upon the older Bulfinch,
it brings the whole subject up to date and
reflects all the results of later scholarship
on the matters of origins and interpretations.
Its bibliographies and extended commentaries
make it invaluable. The story of
Pha&euml;thon is usually thought of as a warning
against presumption, conceit, whim, self-will.
It was probably invented in the first
place to account for the extremely hot
weather of the summer months.</div>


<h4><br />PHA&Euml;THON</h4>

<div class='center'>CHARLES MILLS GAYLEY</div>

<p>Pha&euml;thon was the son of Apollo and
the nymph Clymene. One day Epaphus,
the son of Jupiter and Io, scoffed at the
idea of Pha&euml;thon's being the son of a
god. Pha&euml;thon complained of the insult
to his mother Clymene. She sent him
to Phoebus to ask for himself whether
he had not been truly informed concerning
his parentage. Gladly Pha&euml;thon
traveled toward the regions of sunrise
and gained at last the palace of the sun.
He approached his father's presence, but
stopped at a distance, for the light was
more than he could bear.</p>

<p>Phoebus Apollo, arrayed in purple,
sat on a throne that glittered with
diamonds. Beside him stood the Day,
the Month, the Year, the Hours,
and the Seasons. Surrounded by these
attendants, the Sun beheld the youth
dazzled with the novelty and splendor
of the scene, and inquired the purpose
of his errand. The youth replied, "Oh,
light of the boundless world, Phoebus,
my father&mdash;if thou dost yield me that
name&mdash;give me some proof, I beseech
thee, by which I may be known as
thine!"</p>

<p>He ceased. His father, laying aside
the beams that shone around his head,
bade him approach, embraced him,
owned him for his son, and swore by
the river Styx that whatever proof he
might ask should be granted. Pha&euml;thon
immediately asked to be permitted for
one day to drive the chariot of the sun.
The father repented of his promise and
tried to dissuade the boy by telling him
the perils of the undertaking. "None
but myself," he said, "may drive the
flaming car of day. Not even Jupiter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
whose terrible right arm hurls the
thunderbolts. The first part of the way
is steep and such as the horses when
fresh in the morning can hardly climb;
the middle is high up in the heavens,
whence I myself can scarcely, without
alarm, look down and behold the earth
and sea stretched beneath me. The
last part of the road descends rapidly and
requires most careful driving. Tethys,
who is waiting to receive me, often
trembles for me lest I should fall headlong.
Add to this that the heaven is
all the time turning round and carrying
the stars with it. Couldst thou keep
thy course while the sphere revolved
beneath thee? The road, also, is through
the midst of frightful monsters. Thou
must pass by the horns of the Bull, in
front of the Archer, and near the Lion's
jaws, and where the Scorpion stretches
its arms in one direction and the Crab
in another. Nor wilt thou find it easy
to guide those horses, with their breasts
full of fire that they breathe forth from
their mouths and nostrils. Beware, my
son, lest I be the donor of a fatal gift;
recall the request while yet thou canst."
He ended; but the youth rejected
admonition and held to his demand.
So, having resisted as long as he might,
Phoebus at last led the way to where
stood the lofty chariot.</p>

<p>It was of gold, the gift of Vulcan,&mdash;the
axle of gold, the pole and wheels of
gold, the spokes of silver. Along the
seat were rows of chrysolites and diamonds,
reflecting the brightness of the
sun. While the daring youth gazed in
admiration, the early Dawn threw open
the purple doors of the east and showed
the pathway strewn with roses. The
stars withdrew, marshaled by the Daystar,
which last of all retired also. The
father, when he saw the earth beginning
to glow and the Moon preparing to
retire, ordered the Hours to harness up
the horses. They led forth from the
lofty stalls the steeds full fed with
ambrosia, and attached the reins. Then
the father, smearing the face of his son
with a powerful unguent, made him
capable of enduring the brightness of
the flame. He set the rays on the lad's
head, and, with a foreboding sigh, told
him to spare the whip and hold tight
the reins; not to take the straight road
between the five circles, but to turn off
to the left; to keep within the limit of
the middle zone and avoid the northern
and the southern alike; finally, to keep
in the well-worn ruts and to drive neither
too high nor too low, for the middle
course was safest and best.</p>

<p>Forthwith the agile youth sprang into
the chariot, stood erect, and grasped the
reins with delight, pouring out thanks
to his reluctant parent. But the steeds
soon perceived that the load they drew
was lighter than usual; and as a ship
without its accustomed weight, was
dashed about as if empty. The horses
rushed headlong and left the traveled
road. Then, for the first time, the Great
and Little Bears were scorched with
heat, and would fain, if it were possible,
have plunged into the water; and the
Serpent which lies coiled round the north
pole, torpid and harmless, grew warm,
and with warmth felt its rage revive.
Bo&ouml;tes, they say, fled away, though
encumbered with his plow and unused
to rapid motion.</p>

<p>When hapless Pha&euml;thon looked down
upon the earth, now spreading in vast
extent beneath him, he grew pale, and
his knees shook with terror. He lost
his self-command and knew not whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
to draw tight the reins or throw them
loose; he forgot the names of the horses.
But when he beheld the monstrous forms
scattered over the surface of heaven,&mdash;the
Scorpion extending two great arms,
his tail, and his crooked claws over the
space of two signs of the zodiac,&mdash;when
the boy beheld him, reeking with poison
and menacing with fangs, his courage
failed, and the reins fell from his hands.
The horses, unrestrained, went off into
unknown regions of the sky in among
the stars, hurling the chariot over pathless
places, now up in high heaven, now
down almost to the earth. The moon
saw with astonishment her brother's
chariot running beneath her own. The
clouds began to smoke. The forest-clad
mountains burned,&mdash;Athos and
Taurus and Tmolus and Oete; Ida, once
celebrated for fountains; the Muses'
mountain Helicon, and Haemus; Aetna,
with fires within and without, and
Parnassus, with his two peaks, and
Rhodope, forced at last to part with
his snowy crown. Her cold climate was
no protection to Scythia; Caucasus
burned, and Ossa and Pindus, and,
greater than both, Olympus,&mdash;the Alps
high in air, and the Apennines crowned
with clouds.</p>

<p>Pha&euml;thon beheld the world on fire
and felt the heat intolerable. Then, too,
it is said, the people of Aethiopia became
black because the blood was called by
the heat so suddenly to the surface;
and the Libyan desert was dried up to
the condition in which it remains to
this day. The Nymphs of the fountains,
with disheveled hair, mourned their
waters, nor were the rivers safe beneath
their banks; Tana&iuml;s smoked, and Ca&iuml;cus,
Xanthus, and Maeander; Babylonian
Euphrates and Ganges, Tagus, with
golden sands, and Ca&yuml;ster, where the
swans resort. Nile fled away and hid
his head in the desert, and there it
still remains concealed. Where he used
to discharge his waters through seven
mouths into the sea, seven dry channels
alone remained. The earth cracked open
and through the chinks light broke into
Tartarus and frightened the king of
shadows and his queen. The sea shrank
up. Even Nereus and his wife Doris
with the Nere&iuml;ds, their daughters, sought
the deepest caves for refuge. Thrice
Neptune essayed to raise his head above
the surface and thrice was driven back
by the heat. Earth, surrounded as she
was by waters, yet with head and shoulders
bare, screening her face with her
hand, looked up to heaven, and with
husky voice prayed Jupiter, if it were
his will that she should perish by fire, to
end her agony at once by his thunderbolts,
or else to consider his own Heaven,
how both the poles were smoking that
sustained his palace, and that all must
fall if they were destroyed.</p>

<p>Earth, overcome with heat and thirst,
could say no more. Then Jupiter, calling
the gods to witness that all was lost
unless some speedy remedy were applied,
thundered, brandished a lightning bolt
in his right hand, launched it against
the charioteer, and struck him at the
same moment from his seat and from
existence. Pha&euml;thon, with his hair on
fire, fell headlong, like a shooting star
which marks the heavens with its brightness
as it falls, and Eridanus, the great
river, received him and cooled his burning
frame. His sisters, the Heliades, as
they lamented his fate, were turned into
poplar trees on the banks of the river;
and their tears, which continued to flow,
became amber as they dropped into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
stream. The Italian Naiads reared a
tomb for him and inscribed these words
upon the stone:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Driver of Phoebus' chariot, Pha&euml;thon,<br />
Struck by Jove's thunder, rests beneath this stone.<br />
He could not rule his father's car of fire,<br />
Yet was it much so nobly to aspire.<br />

<p>The Norse myths originated among peoples
who lived in the country which is now Norway,
Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland. In
these lands of the North, winter is long and
dark, and the intense cold is not easily
endured; but summer brings sunshine,
warmth, and happiness. It is not strange,
therefore, that the evil spirits of Norse
mythology should be represented as huge
frost giants and mountain giants. These
giants, or Jotuns, were first formed from the
mist that came from fields of ice. They
lived in a dreary country called J&ouml;tunheim,
and were enemies of the gods, who lived in
the bright, beautiful city of Asgard.</p>

<p>To live the life of the old Norse folk required
strength and courage, for the little boats
in which they went to fish were too small
for storm-tossed Arctic seas, and the weapons
with which they hunted in the cold,
lonely forests were primitive. It is but
natural, therefore, that they should have
idealized strength and courage and that
they should have represented the gods of
Asgard as being large, strong, and courageous.
Although Thor, the eldest son of
Odin, was small in comparison with the
giants, we are told in one of the myths that
he was a mile in height; also he had great
strength and a wonderful hammer, called
Mjolmer, with which he always defeated
the giants and kept them from Asgard.
Thunder was caused by the stroke of Thor's
hammer; hence Thor was called the Thunderer.</p>

<p>The spiritual ideals in Norse mythology are
more important than the physical ideals.
The long, cold winter nights kept the Norse
folk at home; hence they had a love for
home and family relations and a respect for
women that may not be found revealed in
the mythology of Greece. Wisdom and
judgment, too, were more essential than
craft and fraud in encountering the hardships
of their life; therefore they represented
Odin, the supreme god of Asgard, as being
the god of wisdom. The gods of Greek
mythology often used craft and fraud to
accomplish their purposes, but only Loke
among the inhabitants of Asgard relied
upon deception. Loke was descended from
the giants, but was also related to the gods;
so he was permitted to live in Asgard. It
is significant of the spirit of the Norse folk
that the gods did not trust Loke and came
to regard him as their enemy; and it was he
who finally brought misfortune to the gods.</p>

<div class="hang1">This story of Thor's visit to the land of the
giants is taken from Bulfinch. It deals
with one of the favorite sections of Norse
mythology, satisfying, as it does, the
listeners' demand for courageous struggle
against great and mysterious forces. The
use of illusion by the giant forces of evil
as a method of defeating the open-minded
forces of truth is strikingly exemplified in
the various contests staged at J&ouml;tunheim.</div>


<h4><br />THOR'S VISIT TO J&Ouml;TUNHEIM</h4>

<p>One day the god Thor, with his servant
Thialfi, and accompanied by Loki, set
out on a journey to the giants' country.
Thialfi was of all men the swiftest of
foot. He bore Thor's wallet, containing
their provisions. When night came
on they found themselves in an immense
forest, and searched on all sides for a
place where they might pass the night,
and at last came to a very large hall,
with an entrance that took the whole
breadth of one end of the building. Here
they lay down to sleep, but towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
midnight were alarmed by an earthquake
which shook the whole edifice. Thor,
rising up, called on his companions to
seek with him a place of safety. On the
right they found an adjoining chamber,
into which the others entered, but Thor
remained at the doorway with his mallet
in his hand, prepared to defend himself,
whatever might happen. A terrible
groaning was heard during the night,
and at dawn of day Thor went out and
found lying near him a huge giant, who
slept and snored in the way that had
alarmed them so. It is said that for
once Thor was afraid to use his mallet,
and as the giant soon waked up, Thor
contented himself with simply asking
his name.</p>

<p>"My name is Skrymir," said the giant,
"but I need not ask thy name, for I
know that thou art the god Thor. But
what has become of my glove?" Thor
then perceived that what they had
taken overnight for a hall was the
giant's glove, and the chamber where
his two companions had sought refuge
was the thumb. Skrymir then proposed
that they should travel in company, and
Thor consenting, they sat down to eat
their breakfast, and when they had done,
Skrymir packed all the provisions into
one wallet, threw it over his shoulder,
and strode on before them, taking such
tremendous strides that they were hard
put to it to keep up with him. So they
traveled the whole day, and at dusk
Skrymir chose a place for them to pass
the night in under a large oak tree.
Skrymir then told them he would lie
down to sleep. "But take ye the wallet,"
he added, "and prepare your supper."</p>

<p>Skrymir soon fell asleep and began to
snore strongly; but when Thor tried to
open the wallet, he found the giant had
tied it up so tight he could not untie
a single knot. At last Thor became
wroth, and grasping his mallet with
both hands he struck a furious blow
on the giant's head. Skrymir, awakening,
merely asked whether a leaf had
not fallen on his head, and whether
they had supped and were ready to go
to sleep. Thor answered that they were
just going to sleep, and so saying went
and laid himself down under another
tree. But sleep came not that night to
Thor, and when Skrymir snored again
so loud that the forest re&euml;choed with
the noise, he arose, and grasping his
mallet launched it with such force at
the giant's skull that it made a deep
dint in it. Skrymir, awakening, cried
out, "What's the matter? Are there
any birds perched on this tree? I felt
some moss from the branches fall on
my head. How fares it with thee
Thor?" But Thor went away hastily,
saying that he had just then awoke,
and that as it was only midnight, there
was still time for sleep. He, however,
resolved that if he had an opportunity
of striking a third blow, it should settle
all matters between them.</p>

<p>A little before daybreak he perceived
that Skrymir was again fast asleep, and
again grasping his mallet, he dashed it
with such violence that it forced its way
into the giant's skull up to the handle.
But Skrymir sat up, and stroking his
cheek said, "An acorn fell on my
head. What! Art thou awake, Thor?
Methinks it is time for us to get up and
dress ourselves; but you have not now
a long way before you to the city called
Utgard. I have heard you whispering
to one another that I am not a man of
small dimensions; but if you come to
Utgard you will see there many men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
much taller than I. Wherefore, I advise
you, when you come there, not to make
too much of yourselves, for the followers
of Utgard-Loki will not brook the boasting
of such little fellows as you are.
You must take the road that leads
eastward, mine lies northward, so we
must part here."</p>

<p>Hereupon he threw his wallet over
his shoulders and turned away from
them into the forest, and Thor had no
wish to stop him or to ask for any more
of his company.</p>

<p>Thor and his companions proceeded
on their way, and towards noon descried
a city standing in the middle of a plain.
It was so lofty that they were obliged
to bend their necks quite back on their
shoulders in order to see to the top of
it. On arriving they entered the city,
and seeing a large palace before them with
the door wide open, they went in, and
found a number of men of prodigious
stature, sitting on benches in the hall.
Going further, they came before the
king, Utgard-Loki, whom they saluted
with great respect. The king, regarding
them with a scornful smile, said, "If I
do not mistake me, that stripling yonder
must be the god Thor." Then addressing
himself to Thor, he said, "Perhaps
thou mayst be more than thou appearest
to be. What are the feats that thou
and thy fellows deem yourselves skilled
in, for no one is permitted to remain
here who does not, in some feat or
other, excel all other men?"</p>

<p>"The feat that I know," said Loki,
"is to eat quicker than any one else,
and in this I am ready to give a proof
against any one here who may choose
to compete with me."</p>

<p>"That will indeed be a feat," said
Utgard-Loki, "if thou performest what
thou promisest, and it shall be tried
forthwith."</p>

<p>He then ordered one of his men who
was sitting at the farther end of the
bench, and whose name was Logi, to
come forward and try his skill with
Loki. A trough filled with meat having
been set on the hall floor, Loki placed
himself at one end, and Logi at the other,
and each of them began to eat as fast
as he could, until they met in the middle
of the trough. But it was found that
Loki had only eaten the flesh, while his
adversary had devoured both flesh and
bone, and the trough to boot. All the
company therefore adjudged that Loki
was vanquished.</p>

<p>Utgard-Loki then asked what feat
the young man who accompanied Thor
could perform. Thialfi answered that
he would run a race with any one who
might be matched against him. The
king observed that skill in running was
something to boast of, but if the youth
would win the match he must display
great agility. He then arose and went
with all who were present to a plain where
there was good ground for running on,
and calling a young man named Hugi,
bade him run a match with Thialfi. In
the first course Hugi so much outstripped
his competitor that he turned back and
met him not far from the starting place.
Then they ran a second and a third
time, but Thialfi met with no better
success.</p>

<p>Utgard-Loki then asked Thor in what
feats he would choose to give proofs of
that prowess for which he was so famous.
Thor answered that he would try a
drinking-match with any one. Utgard-Loki
bade his cup-bearer bring the large
horn which his followers were obliged
to empty when they had trespassed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
any way against the law of the feast.
The cup-bearer having presented it to
Thor, Utgard-Loki said, "Whoever is a
good drinker will empty that horn at
a single draught, though most men make
two of it, but the most puny drinker can
do it in three."</p>

<p>Thor looked at the horn, which seemed
of no extraordinary size though somewhat
long; however, as he was very thirsty,
he set it to his lips, and without drawing
breath, pulled as long and as deeply
as he could, that he might not be obliged
to make a second draught of it; but
when he set the horn down and looked
in, he could scarcely perceive that the
liquor was diminished.</p>

<p>After taking breath, Thor went to it
again with all his might, but when he
took the horn from his mouth, it seemed
to him that he had drunk rather less
than before, although the horn could
now be carried without spilling.</p>

<p>"How now, Thor?" said Utgard-Loki;
"thou must not spare thyself. If thou
meanest to drain the horn at the third
draught thou must pull deeply; and I
must needs say that thou wilt not be
called so mighty a man here as thou art
at home if thou showest no greater
prowess in other feats than methinks
will be shown in this."</p>

<p>Thor, full of wrath, again set the horn
to his lips and did his best to empty it;
but on looking in found the liquor was
only a little lower, so he resolved to make
no further attempt, but gave back the
horn to the cup-bearer.</p>

<p>"I now see plainly," said Utgard-Loki,
"that thou art not quite so stout
as we thought thee; but wilt thou try
any other feat, though methinks thou
art not likely to bear any prize away
with thee hence?"</p>

<p>"What new trial hast thou to propose?"
said Thor.</p>

<p>"We have a very trifling game here,"
answered Utgard-Loki, "in which we
exercise none but children. It consists
in merely lifting my cat from the ground;
nor should I have dared to mention such
a feat to the great Thor if I had not
already observed that thou art by no
means what we took thee for."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, a large gray
cat sprang on the hall floor. Thor put
his hand under the cat's belly and did
his utmost to raise him from the floor,
but the cat, bending his back, had,
notwithstanding all Thor's efforts, only
one of his feet lifted up, seeing which
Thor made no further attempt.</p>

<p>"This trial has turned out," said
Utgard-Loki, "just as I imagined it
would. The cat is large, but Thor is
little in comparison to our men."</p>

<p>"Little as ye call me," answered Thor,
"let me see who among you will come
hither now I am in wrath and wrestle
with me."</p>

<p>"I see no one here," said Utgard-Loki,
looking at the men sitting on the benches,
"who would not think it beneath him
to wrestle with thee; let somebody, however,
call hither that old crone, my
nurse Elli, and let Thor wrestle with her
if he will. She has thrown to the ground
many a man not less strong than this
Thor is."</p>

<p>A toothless old woman then entered
the hall, and was told by Utgard-Loki
to take hold of Thor. The tale is shortly
told. The more Thor tightened his
hold on the crone the firmer she stood.
At length after a very violent struggle
Thor began to lose his footing, and was
finally brought down upon one knee.
Utgard-Loki then told them to desist,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
adding that Thor had now no occasion
to ask any one else in the hall to wrestle
with him, and it was also getting late;
so he showed Thor and his companions
to their seats, and they passed the night
there in good cheer.</p>

<p>The next morning, at break of day,
Thor and his companions dressed themselves
and prepared for their departure.
Utgard-Loki ordered a table to be set
for them, on which there was no lack
of victuals or drink. After the repast
Utgard-Loki led them to the gate of
the city, and on parting asked Thor how
he thought his journey had turned out,
and whether he had met with any men
stronger than himself. Thor told him
that he could not deny but that he had
brought great shame on himself. "And
what grieves me most," he added, "is
that ye will call me a person of little
worth."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Utgard-Loki, "it behooves
me to tell thee the truth, now thou art
out of the city, which so long as I live
and have my way thou shalt never enter
again. And, by my troth, had I known
beforehand that thou hadst so much
strength in thee, and wouldst have
brought me so near to a great mishap, I
would not have suffered thee to enter
this time. Know then that I have all
along deceived thee by my illusions;
first in the forest, where I tied up the
wallet with iron wire so that thou
couldst not untie it. After this thou
gavest me three blows with thy mallet;
the first, though the least, would have
ended my days had it fallen on me, but
I slipped aside and thy blows fell on the
mountain, where thou wilt find three
glens, one of them remarkably deep.
These are the dints made by thy mallet.
I have made use of similar illusions in
the contests you have had with my
followers. In the first, Loki, like hunger
itself, devoured all that was set before
him, but Logi was in reality nothing
else than Fire, and therefore consumed
not only the meat, but the trough which
held it. Hugi, with whom Thialfi contended
in running, was Thought, and it
was impossible for Thialfi to keep pace
with that. When thou in thy turn
didst attempt to empty the horn, thou
didst perform, by my troth, a deed so
marvelous that had I not seen it myself
I should never have believed it. For
one end of that horn reached the sea,
which thou wast not aware of, but when
thou comest to the shore thou wilt
perceive how much the sea has sunk
by thy draughts. Thou didst perform
a feat no less wonderful by lifting up
the cat, and to tell thee the truth, when
we saw that one of his paws was off
the floor, we were all of us terror-stricken,
for what thou tookest for a cat was in
reality the Midgard serpent that encompasseth
the earth, and he was so stretched
by thee that he was barely long enough
to enclose it between his head and tail.
Thy wrestling with Elli was also a most
astonishing feat, for there was never
yet a man, nor ever will be, whom Old
Age, for such in fact was Elli, will not
sooner or later lay low. But now, as
we are going to part, let me tell thee
that it will be better for both of us if
thou never come near me again, for
shouldst thou do so, I shall again defend
myself by other illusions, so that thou
wilt only lose thy labor and get no fame
from the contest with me."</p>

<p>On hearing these words Thor in a rage
laid hold of his mallet and would have
launched it at him, but Utgard-Loki had
disappeared, and when Thor would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
returned to the city to destroy it, he
found nothing around him but a verdant
plain.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_265" id="Note_265">265</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">One of the very best sources for the stories of
Norse mythology is the little book called
<i>Norse Stories</i>, by Hamilton Wright Mabie
(1846-1916). (Edited by Katherine Lee
Bates, and published by Rand McNally &amp;
Co., Chicago. Copyright, and used here
by permission.) It reads well as a connected
story and the versions follow closely
the originals as found in the ancient Eddas.
In his introduction Mr. Mabie comments
upon those who made these stories, in language
that suggests something of the value
of the stories to us: "They thought of life
as a tremendous fight, and they wanted to
acquit themselves like men; enduring hardship
without repining, doing hard work
honestly and with a whole heart, and dying
with their faces toward their foes. Their
heaven was a place for heroes, and their
gods were men of heroic size and spirit."
Of the subject of the following myth it has
been said, "Odin had no less than two hundred
names, as, Father of the Ages, Father
of Hosts, Father of Victory, the High One,
the Swift One, the Wanderer, Long-Beard,
Burning-Eye, Slouchy-Hat. Odin is a one-eyed
god, because the sky has but one sun.
His raiment is sometimes blue and sometimes
gray, as the weather is fair or cloudy."</div>


<h4><br />ODIN'S SEARCH FOR WISDOM</h4>

<div class='center'>HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE</div>

<p>The wonderful ash-tree, Ygdrasil, made
a far-spreading shade against the fierce
heat of the sun in summer, and a stronghold
against the piercing winds of winter.
No man could remember when it had
been young. Little children played under
its branches, grew to be strong men
and women, lived to be old and weary
and feeble, and died; and yet the ash-tree
gave no signs of decay. Forever
preserving its freshness and beauty, it
was to live as long as there were men to
look upon it, animals to feed under it,
birds to flutter among its branches.</p>

<p>This mighty ash-tree touched and
bound all the worlds together in its
wonderful circle of life. One root it
sent deep down into the sightless depths
of Hel, where the dead lived; another
it fastened firmly in J&ouml;tunheim, the
dreary home of the giants; and with
the third it grasped Midgard, the dwelling
place of men. Serpents and all
kinds of worms gnawed continually at
its roots, but were never able to destroy
them. Its branches spread out over
the whole earth, and the topmost boughs
swayed in the clear air of Asgard itself,
rustling against the Valhal, the home of
the heroes who had done great deeds
or died manfully in battle. At the foot
of the tree sat the three Norns, wonderful
spinners of fate, who weave the
thread of every man's life, making it
what they will; and a strange weaving
it often was, cut off when the pattern
was just beginning to show itself. And
every day these Norns sprinkled the
tree with the water of life from the
Urdar fountain, and so kept it forever
green. In the topmost branches sat an
eagle singing a strange song about the
birth of the world, its decay and death.
Under its branches browsed all manner
of animals; among its leaves every kind
of bird made its nest; by day the rainbow
hung under it; at night the pale
northern light flashed over it, and as
the winds swept through its rustling
branches, the multitudinous murmur of
the leaves told strange stories of the
past and of the future.</p>

<p>The giants were older than the gods,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and knew so much more of the past
that the gods had to go to them for
wisdom. After a time, however, the
gods became wiser than the giants, or
they would have ceased to be gods, and
been destroyed by the giants, instead
of destroying them. When the world
was still young, and there were still many
things which even the gods had to learn,
Odin was so anxious to become wise
that he went to a deep well whose waters
touched the roots of Ygdrasil itself.
The keeper of the well was a very old
and very wise giant, named Mimer, or
Memory, and he gave no draughts out
of the well until he was well paid; for
the well contained the water of wisdom,
and whoever drank of it became straightway
wonderfully wise.</p>

<p>"Give me a draught of this clear
water, O Mimer," said Odin, when he
had reached the well, and was looking
down into its clear, fathomless depths.</p>

<p>Mimer, the keeper, was so old that
he could remember everything that had
ever happened. His eyes were clear and
calm as the stars, his face was noble and
restful, and his long white beard flowed
down to his waist.</p>

<p>"This water is only to be had at a
great price," he said in a wonderfully
sweet, majestic tone. "I cannot give
to all who ask, but only to those who
are able and willing to give greatly in
return," he continued.</p>

<p>If Odin had been less of a god he
would have thought longer and bargained
sharper, but he was so godlike
that he cared more to be wise and great
than for anything else.</p>

<p>"I will give you whatever you ask,"
he answered.</p>

<p>Mimer thought a moment. "You
must leave an eye," he said at last.</p>

<p>Then he drew up a great draught of
the sparkling water, and Odin quenched
his divine thirst and went away rejoicing,
although he had left an eye behind.
Even the gods could not be wise without
struggle and toil and sacrifice.</p>

<p>So Odin became the wisest in all the
worlds, and there was no god or giant
that could contend with him. There
was one giant, however, who was called
all-wise in J&ouml;tunheim, with whom many
had contended in knowledge, with curious
and difficult questions, and had always
been silenced and killed, for then, as
now, a man's life often depended on his
wisdom. Of this giant, Vafthrudner, and
his wisdom many wonderful stories were
told, and even among the gods his fame
was great. One day as Odin sat thinking
of many strange things in the worlds,
and many mysterious things in the future,
he thought of Vafthrudner. "I will go to
J&ouml;tunheim and measure wisdom with Vafthrudner,
the wisest of the giants," said
he to Frigg, his wife, who was sitting by.</p>

<p>Then Frigg remembered those who had
gone to contend with the all-wise giant
and had never come back, and a fear
came over her that the same fate might
befall Odin.</p>

<p>"You are wisest in all the worlds,
All-Father," she said; "why should
you seek a treacherous giant who knows
not half so much as you?"</p>

<p>But Odin, who feared nothing, could
not be persuaded to stay, and Frigg
sadly said good-by as he passed out of
Asgard on his journey to J&ouml;tunheim.
His blue mantle set with stars and his
golden helmet he left behind him, and
as he journeyed swiftly those who met
him saw nothing godlike in him; nor did
Vafthrudner when at last he stood at
the giant's door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am a simple traveler, Gangraad
by name," he said, as Vafthrudner came
gruffly toward him. "I ask your hospitality
and a chance to strive with you
in wisdom." The giant laughed scornfully
at the thought of a man coming
to contend with him for mastery in
knowledge.</p>

<p>"You shall have all you want of
both," he growled, "and if you cannot
answer my questions you shall never
go hence alive."</p>

<p>He did not even ask Odin to sit down,
but let him stand in the hall, despising
him too much to show him any courtesy.
After a time he began to ask questions.</p>

<p>"Tell me, if you can, O wise Gangraad,
the name of the river which
divides Asgard from J&ouml;tunheim."</p>

<p>"The river Ifing, which never freezes
over," answered Odin quickly, as if it
were the easiest question in the world;
and indeed it was to him, although no
man could have answered it. Vafthrudner
looked up in great surprise
when he heard the reply.</p>

<p>"Good," he said, "you have answered
rightly. Tell me, now, the names of
the horses that carry day and night
across the sky."</p>

<p>Before the words were fairly spoken
Odin replied, "Skinfaxe and Hrimfaxe."
The giant could not conceal his surprise
that a man should know these things.</p>

<p>"Once more," he said quickly, as if
he were risking everything on one question;
"tell me the name of the plain
where the Last Battle will be fought."</p>

<p>This was a terrible question, for the
Last Battle was still far off in the future,
and only the gods and the greatest of
the giants knew where and when it
would come. Odin bowed his head
when he heard the words, for to be ready
for that battle was the divine work of
his life, and then said, slowly and
solemnly, "On the plain of Vigrid, which
is one hundred miles on each side."</p>

<p>Vafthrudner rose trembling from his
seat. He knew now that Gangraad was
some great one in disguise, and that his
own life hung on the answers he himself
would soon be forced to make.</p>

<p>"Sit here beside me," he said, "for
whoever you are, worthier antagonist
has never entered these walls."</p>

<p>Then they sat down together in the
rude stone hall, the mightiest of the
gods and the wisest of the giants, and
the great contest in wisdom, with a life
hanging in either scale, went on between
them. Wonderful secrets of the time
when no man was and the time when
no man will be, those silent walls listened
to as Vafthrudner asked Odin one deep
question after another, the answer coming
swiftly and surely.</p>

<p>After a time the giant could ask no
more, for he had exhausted his wisdom.</p>

<p>"It is my turn now," said Odin, and
one after another he drew out from
Vafthrudner the events of the past and
then the wonderful things of the race
of giants, and finally he began to question
him of that dim, mysterious future
whose secrets only the gods know; and
as he touched these wonderful things
Odin's eyes began to flash, and his form
to grow larger and nobler until he seemed
no longer the humble Gangraad, but the
mighty god he was, and Vafthrudner
trembled as he felt the coming doom
nearing him with every question.</p>

<p>So hours went by, until at last Odin
paused in his swift questioning, stooped
down, and asked the giant, "What did
Odin whisper in the ear of Balder as he
ascended the funeral pile?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Only Odin himself could answer this
question, and Vafthrudner replied
humbly and with awe, "Who but thyself,
All-Father, knoweth the words thou
didst say to thy son in the days of old?
I have brought my doom upon myself,
for in my ignorance I have contended
with wisdom itself. Thou art ever the
wisest of all."</p>

<p>So Odin conquered, and Wisdom was
victorious, as she always has been even
when she has contended with giants.</p>

<div class="hang1">The story of the splendid courage of Tyr at
the time of the chaining up of the terrible
Fenris wolf has always been one of the
favorite Norse tales. The three repulsive
giant monsters in whom the forces of evil
are embodied are well imagined to suggest
to us powers that may finally be stronger
than the gods themselves. The failures to
find a chain strong enough, and the final
success with the magic bond made in
Dwarfland, form a series of powerfully
dramatic steps in the story. The elements
of which the slender rope is made never
fail to fascinate hearers, young or old, with
a sense of the most profound mystery.
"Why the dwarfs should be able to make a
chain strong enough to bind him, which
the gods had failed to do, is a puzzle. May
it mean that subtlety can compass ends
which force has to relinquish, or possibly
a better thing than subtlety, gentleness?"
And the final need of a hero willing to take
extreme risks for some good greater than
himself is amply and admirably satisfied
in the brave Tyr. The version of the story
used here is from Miss E. M. Wilmot-Buxton's
<i>Stories of Norse Heroes</i>.</div>


<h4><br />HOW THE FENRIS WOLF WAS
CHAINED</h4>

<div class='center'>E. M. WILMOT-BUXTON</div>

<p>Fair as were the meads of Asgard, we
have seen that the Asa folk were fond of
wandering far afield in other regions.
Most restless of all was Red Loki, that
cunning fellow who was always bringing
trouble upon himself or upon his
kindred. And because he loved evil,
he would often betake himself to the
gloomy halls of Giantland and mingle
with the wicked folk of that region.</p>

<p>Now one day he met a hideous giantess
named Angur-Boda. This creature had
a heart of ice, and because he loved
ugliness and evil she had a great attraction
for him, and in the end he married
her, and they lived together in a horrible
cave in Giantland.</p>

<p>Three children were born to Loki and
Angur-Boda in this dread abode, and
they were even more terrible in appearance
than their mother. The first was
an immense wolf called Fenris, with a
huge mouth filled with long white teeth,
which he was constantly gnashing
together. The second was a wicked-looking
serpent with a fiery-red tongue
lolling from its mouth. The third was
a hideous giantess, partly blue and partly
flesh color, whose name was Hela.</p>

<p>No sooner were these three terrible
children born than all the wise men of
the earth began to foretell the misery
they would bring upon the Asa folk.</p>

<p>In vain did Loki try to keep them
hidden within the cave wherein their
mother dwelt. They soon grew so
immense in size that no dwelling would
contain them, and all the world began
to talk of their frightful appearance.</p>

<p>It was not long, of course, before
All-Father Odin, from his high seat in
Asgard, heard of the children of Loki.
So he sent for some of the Asas, and said:
"Much evil will come upon us, O my
children, from this giant brood, if we
defend not ourselves against them. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
their mother will teach them wickedness,
and still more quickly will they
learn the cunning wiles of their father.
Fetch me them here, therefore, that I
may deal with them forthwith."</p>

<p>So, after somewhat of a struggle, the
Asas captured the three giant-children
and brought them before Odin's judgment
seat.</p>

<p>Then Odin looked first at Hela, and
when he saw her gloomy eyes, full of
misery and despair, he was sorry, and
dealt kindly with her, saying: "Thou
art the bringer of Pain to man, and
Asgard is no place for such as thou.
But I will make thee ruler of the Mist
Home, and there shalt thou rule over that
unlighted world, the Region of the Dead."</p>

<p>Forthwith he sent her away over
rough roads to the cold, dark region of
the North called the Mist Home. And
there did Hela rule over a grim crew,
for all those who had done wickedness
in the world above were imprisoned by
her in those gloomy regions. To her
came also all those who had died, not on
the battlefield, but of old age or disease.
And though these were treated kindly
enough, theirs was a joyless life in comparison
with that of the dead warriors
who were feasting and fighting in the
halls of Valhalla, under the kindly rule
of All-Father Odin.</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of Hela, Odin
next turned his attention to the serpent.
And when he saw his evil tongue and
cunning, wicked eyes, he said: "Thou
art he who bringest Sin into the world
of men; therefore the ocean shall be
thy home forever."</p>

<p>Then he threw that horrid serpent
into the deep sea which surrounds all
lands, and there the creature grew so
fast that when he stretched himself one
day he encircled all the earth, and held
his own tail fast in his mouth. And
sometimes he grew angry to think that
he, the son of a god, had thus been
cast out; and at those times he would
writhe with his huge body and lash his
tail till the sea spouted up to the sky.
And when that happened the men of the
North said that a great tempest was
raging. But it was only the serpent-son
of Loki writhing in his wrath.</p>

<p>Then Odin turned to the third child.
And behold! the Fenris Wolf was so
appalling to look upon that Odin feared
to cast him forth, and he decided to
endeavor to tame him by kindness so
that he should not wish them ill.</p>

<p>But when he bade them carry food
to the Fenris Wolf, not one of the Asas
would do so, for they feared a snap
from his great jaws. Only the brave
Tyr had courage enough to feed him,
and the wolf ate so much and so fast
that the business took him all his time.
Meantime, too, the Fenris grew so
rapidly, and became so fierce, that the
gods were compelled to take counsel
and consider how they should get rid
of him. They remembered that it would
make their peaceful halls unholy if they
were to slay him, and so they resolved
instead to bind him fast, that he should
be unable to do them harm.</p>

<p>So those of the Asa folk who were
clever smiths set to work and made a
very strong, thick chain; and when it
was finished they carried it out to the
yard where the wolf dwelt, and said to
him, as though in jest: "Here is a fine
proof of thy boasted strength, O Fenris.
Let us bind this about thee, that we may
see if thou canst break it asunder."</p>

<p>Then the wolf gave a great grin with
his wide jaws, and came and stood still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
that they might bind the chain about
him; for he knew what he could do.
And it came to pass that directly they
had fastened the chain, and had slipped
aside from him, the great beast gave
himself a shake, and the chain fell about
him in little bits. At this the Asas
were much annoyed, but they tried not
to show it, and praised him for his
strength.</p>

<p>Then they set to work again upon a
chain much stronger than the last, and
brought it to the Fenris Wolf, saying:
"Great will be thy renown, O Fenris, if
thou canst break this chain as thou didst
the last."</p>

<p>But the wolf looked at them askance,
for the chain they brought was very
much thicker than the one he had already
broken. He reflected, however, that
since that time he himself had grown
stronger and bigger, and moreover, that
one must risk something in order to
win renown.</p>

<p>So he let them put the chain upon
him, and when the Asas said that all
was ready, he gave a good shake and
stretched himself a few times, and again
the fetters lay in fragments on the ground.</p>

<p>Then the gods began to fear that they
would never hold the wolf in bonds;
and it was All-Father Odin who persuaded
them to make one more attempt. So they
sent a messenger to Dwarfland bidding
him ask the Little Men to make a chain
which nothing could possibly destroy.</p>

<p>Setting at once to work, the clever
little smiths soon fashioned a slender
silken rope, and gave it to the messenger,
saying that no strength could break it,
and that the more it was strained the
stronger it would become.</p>

<p>It was made of the most mysterious
things&mdash;the sound of a cat's footsteps,
the roots of a mountain, the sinews of
a bear, the breath of fishes, and other
such strange materials, which only the
dwarfs knew how to use. With this
chain the messenger hastened back over
the Rainbow Bridge to Asgard.</p>

<p>By this time the Fenris Wolf had grown
too big for his yard, so he lived on a
rocky island in the middle of the lake
that lies in the midst of Asgard. And
here the Asas now betook themselves
with their chain, and began to play their
part with wily words.</p>

<p>"See," they cried, "O Fenris! Here is
a cord so soft and thin that none would
think of it binding such strength as
thine." And they laughed great laughs,
and handed it to one another, and tried
its strength by pulling at it with all
their might, but it did not break.</p>

<p>Then they came nearer and used more
wiles, saying: "<i>We</i> cannot break the
cord, though 'tis stronger than it looks,
but thou, O mighty one, will be able
to snap it in a moment."</p>

<p>But the wolf tossed his head in scorn,
and said: "Small renown would there
be to me, O Asa folk, if I were to break
yon slender string. Save, therefore, your
breath, and leave me now alone."</p>

<p>"Aha!" cried the Asas, "thou fearest
the might of the silken cord, thou false
one, and that is why thou wilt not let
us bind thee!"</p>

<p>"Not I," said the Fenris Wolf, growing
rather suspicious, "but if it is made
with craft and guile it shall never come
near my feet."</p>

<p>"But," said the Asas, "thou wilt
surely be able to break this silken cord
with ease, since thou hast already broken
the great iron fetters."</p>

<p>To this the wolf made no answer,
pretending not to hear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come!" said the Asas again, "why
shouldst thou fear? For even if thou
couldst not break the cord we would
immediately let thee free again. To
refuse is a coward's piece of work."</p>

<p>Then the wolf gnashed his teeth at
them in anger, and said: "Well I know
you Asas! For if you bind me so fast
that I cannot get loose you will skulk
away, and it will be long before I get
any help from you; and therefore am
I loth to let this band be laid upon me."</p>

<p>But still the Asas continued to persuade
him and to twit him with cowardice
until at length the Fenris Wolf said,
with a sullen growl: "Have it your own
way then. But, as a pledge that this
is done without deceit, let one of you
lay his hand in my mouth while you are
binding me, and afterwards while I try
to break the bonds."</p>

<p>Then the Asa folk looked at one
another in dismay, for they knew very
well what this would mean. And while
they consulted together the wolf stood
gnashing his teeth at them with a horrid
grin.</p>

<p>At length Tyr the Brave hesitated no
longer. Boldly he stalked up to the
wolf and thrust his arm into his enormous
mouth, bidding the Asas bind fast the
beast. Scarce had they done so when
the wolf began to strain and pull, but
the more he did so the tighter and
stiffer the rope became.</p>

<p>The gods shouted and laughed with
glee when they saw how all his efforts
were in vain. But Tyr did not join in
their mirth, for the wolf in his rage
snapped his great teeth together and
bit off his hand at the wrist.</p>

<p>Now when the Asas discovered that
the animal was fast bound, they took the
chain which was fixed to the rope and
drew it through a huge rock, and fastened
this rock deep down in the earth, so
that it could never be moved. And this
they fastened to another great rock which
was driven still deeper into the ground.</p>

<p>When the Fenris Wolf found that he
had been thus secured he opened his
mouth terribly wide, and twisted himself
right and left, and tried his best to
bite the Asa folk. He uttered, moreover,
such terrible howls that at length
the gods could bear it no longer. So
they took a sword and thrust it into his
mouth, so that the hilt rested on his
lower, and the point against his upper,
jaw. And there he was doomed to
remain until the end of All Things shall
come, when he</p>

<h3><br /><a name="Note_267" id="Note_267">267</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">The story of Frey in the Norse mythology
corresponds to that of Persephone (Proserpine)
in classic mythology. (See No. <a href="#Note_255">255</a>.)
Frey is "the god of the earth's fruitfulness,
presiding over rain, sunshine, and all the
fruits of the earth, and dispensing wealth
among men." Skirnir is the sun-warmed
air, and Gerda is the seed. The version of
the story used below is from <i>The Heroes of
Asgard</i> by Annie and Eliza Keary. This
book was first published in 1854, and while
a little old-fashioned in style is still one of
the most pleasing attempts to tell the Norse
myths for young people.</div>


<h4><br />FREY</h4>

<div class='center'>A. AND E. KEARY</div>


<div class='center'><br />PART I</div>

<div class='center'>ON TIPTOE IN AIR THRONE</div>

<p>Wherever Frey came there was summer
and sunshine. Flowers sprang up
under his footsteps, and bright-winged
insects, like flying flowers, hovered round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
his head. His warm breath ripened the
fruit on the trees, and gave a bright
yellow color to the corn, and purple
bloom to the grapes, as he passed through
fields and vineyards.</p>

<p>When he rode along in his car, drawn
by the stately boar, Golden Bristles,
soft winds blew before him, filling the
air with fragrance and spreading abroad
the news, "Van Frey is coming!" and
every half-closed flower burst into perfect
beauty, and forest, and field, and
hill flushed their richest colors to greet
his presence.</p>

<p>Under Frey's care and instruction the
pretty little light elves forgot their idle
ways and learned all the pleasant tasks
he had promised to teach them. It
was the prettiest possible sight to see
them in the evening filling their tiny
buckets, and running about among the
woods and meadows to hang the dew-drops
deftly on the slender tips of the
grass-blades, or to drop them into the
half-closed cups of the sleepy flowers.
When this last of their day's tasks was
over they used to cluster round their
summer-king, like bees about the queen,
while he told them stories about the
wars between the Aesir and the giants,
or of the old time when he lived alone
with his father Ni&ouml;rd, in Noatun, and
listened to the waves singing songs of
far distant lands. So pleasantly did
they spend their time in Alfheim.</p>

<p>But in the midst of all this work and
play Frey had a wish in his mind, of
which he could not help often talking to
his clear-minded messenger and friend
Skirnir. "I have seen many things,"
he used to say, "and traveled through
many lands; but to see all the world at
once, as Asa Odin does from Air Throne,
<i>that</i> must be a splendid sight."</p>

<p>"Only Father Odin may sit on Air
Throne," Skirnir would say; and it
seemed to Frey that this answer was not
so much to the purpose as his friend's
sayings generally were.</p>

<p>At length, one very clear summer
evening, when Odin was feasting with
the other Aesir in Valhalla, Frey could
restrain his curiosity no longer. He left
Alfheim, where all the little elves were
fast asleep, and, without asking any
one's advice, climbed into Air Throne,
and stood on tiptoe in Odin's very seat.
It was a clear evening, and I had,
perhaps, better not even try to tell you
what Frey saw.</p>

<p>He looked first all round him over
Manheim, where the rosy light of the
set sun still lingered, and where men,
and birds, and flowers were gathering
themselves up for their night's repose;
then he glanced towards the heavenly
hills where Bifr&ouml;st rested, and then
towards the shadowy land which deepened
down into Niflheim. At length he
turned his eyes northward to the misty
land of J&ouml;tunheim. There the shades
of evening had already fallen; but from
his high place Frey could still see distinct
shapes moving about through the gloom.
Strange and monstrous shapes they were,
and Frey stood a little higher, on tiptoe,
that he might look further after them.
In this position he could just descry a
tall house standing on a hill in the very
middle of J&ouml;tunheim. While he looked
at it a maiden came and lifted up her
arms to undo the latch of the door. It
was dusk in J&ouml;tunheim; but when this
maiden lifted up her white arms, such
a dazzling reflection came from them,
that J&ouml;tunheim, and the sky, and all
the sea were flooded with clear light.
For a moment everything could be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
distinctly seen; but Frey saw nothing but
the face of the maiden with the uplifted
arms; and when she had entered the
house and shut the door after her, and
darkness fell again on earth, and sky,
and sea,&mdash;darkness fell, too, upon Frey's
heart.</p>


<div class='center'><br />PART II</div>

<div class='center'>THE GIFT</div>

<p>The next morning, when the little elves
awoke up with the dawn, and came
thronging round their king to receive his
commands, they were surprised to see
that he had changed since they last
saw him.</p>

<p>"He has grown up in the night,"
they whispered one to another sorrowfully.
And in truth he was no longer
so fit a teacher and playfellow for the
merry little people as he had been a few
hours before.</p>

<p>It was to no purpose that the sweet
winds blew, and the flowers opened,
when Frey came forth from his chamber.
A bright white light still danced
before him, and nothing now seemed
to him worth looking at. That evening
when the sun had set, and work
was over, there were no stories for the
light elves.</p>

<p>"Be still," Frey said, when they pressed
round. "If you will be still and listen,
there are stories enough to be heard
better than mine."</p>

<p>I do not know whether the elves heard
anything; but to Frey it seemed that
flowers, and birds, and winds, and the
whispering rivers, united that day in
singing one song, which he never wearied
of hearing. "We are fair," they said;
"but there is nothing in the whole world
so fair as Gerda, the giant-maiden whom
you saw last night in J&ouml;tunheim."</p>

<p>"Frey has dew-drops in his eyes," the
little elves said to each other in whispers
as they sat round looking up at him, and
they felt very much surprised; for only
to men and the Aesir is it permitted to
be sorrowful and weep. Soon, however,
wiser people noticed the change that had
come over the summer-king, and his
good-natured father, Ni&ouml;rd, sent Skirnir
one day into Alfheim to inquire into the
cause of Frey's sorrow.</p>

<p>He found him walking alone in a shady
place, and Frey was glad enough to tell
his trouble to his wise friend.</p>

<p>When he had related the whole story,
he said, "And now you will see that
there is no use in asking me to be merry
as I used to be; for how can I ever be
happy in Alfheim, and enjoy the summer
and sunshine, while my dear Gerda, whom
I love, is living in a dark, cold land,
among cruel giants?"</p>

<p>"If she be really as beautiful and
beloved as you say," answered Skirnir,
"she must be sadly out of place in
J&ouml;tunheim. Why do not you ask her
to be your wife, and live with you in
Alfheim?"</p>

<p>"That would I only too gladly do,"
answered Frey; "but if I were to leave
Alfheim only for a few hours, the cruel
giant Ryme,&mdash;the Frost Giant&mdash;would
rush in to take my place; all the labors
of the year would be undone in a night,
and the poor, toiling men, who are
watching for the harvest, would wake
some morning to find their corn fields
and orchards buried in snow."</p>

<p>"Well," said Skirnir, thoughtfully, "I
am neither so strong nor so beautiful
as you, Frey; but, if you will give me
the sword that hangs by your side, I will
undertake the journey to J&ouml;tunheim;
and I will speak in such a way of you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
and of Alfheim, to the lovely Gerda,
that she will gladly leave her land and
the house of her giant-father to come to
you."</p>

<p>Now, Frey's sword was a gift, and he
knew well enough that he ought not to
part with it, or trust it in any hands
but his own; and yet how could he
expect Skirnir to risk all the dangers
of J&ouml;tunheim for any less recompense
than an enchanted sword? And what
other hope had he of ever seeing his dear
Gerda again?</p>

<p>He did not allow himself a moment
to think of the choice he was making.
He unbuckled his sword from his side
and put it into Skirnir's hands; and
then he turned rather pettishly away,
and threw himself down on a mossy
bank under a tree.</p>

<p>"You will be many days in traveling
to J&ouml;tunheim," he said, "and all that
time I shall be miserable."</p>

<p>Skirnir was too sensible to think this
speech worth answering. He took a
hasty farewell of Frey, and prepared to
set off on his journey; but, before he
left the hill, he chanced to see the reflection
of Frey's face in a little pool of
water that lay near. In spite of its
sorrowful expression, it was as beautiful
as the woods are in full summer, and a
clever thought came into Skirnir's mind.
He stooped down, without Frey's seeing
him, and, with cunning touch, stole the
picture out of the water; then he fastened
it up carefully in his silver drinking-horn,
and, hiding it in his mantle, he
mounted his horse and rode towards
J&ouml;tunheim, secure of succeeding in
his mission, since he carried a matchless
sword to conquer the giant,
and a matchless picture to win the
maiden.</p>


<div class='center'><br />PART III</div>

<div class='center'>FAIREST GERDA</div>

<p>The house of Gymir, Gerda's father,
stood in the middle of J&ouml;tunheim, so it
will not be difficult for you to imagine
what a toilsome and wondrous journey
Skirnir had. He was a brave hero, and
he rode a brave horse; but, when they
came to the barrier of murky flame that
surrounds J&ouml;tunheim, a shudder came
over both.</p>

<p>"Dark it is without," said Skirnir to
his horse, "and you and I must leap
through flame, and go over hoar mountains
among Giant Folk. The giants
will take us both, or we shall return
victorious together." Then he patted
his horse's neck, and touched him with
his armed heel, and with one bound he
cleared the barrier, and his hoofs rang
on the frozen land.</p>

<p>Their first day's journey was through
the land of the Frost Giants, whose
prickly touch kills, and whose breath is
sharper than swords. Then they passed
through the dwellings of the horse-headed
and vulture-headed giants&mdash;monsters
terrible to see. Skirnir hid
his face, and the horse flew along swifter
than the wind.</p>

<p>On the evening of the third day they
reached Gymir's house. Skirnir rode
round it nine times; but though there
were twenty doors, he could find no
entrance; for fierce three-headed dogs
guarded every doorway.</p>

<p>At length he saw a herdsman pass
near, and he rode up and asked him
how it was possible for a stranger to
enter Gymir's house, or get a sight of
his fair daughter Gerda.</p>

<p>"Are you doomed to death, or are
you already a dead man," answered the
herdsman, "that you talk of seeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Gymir's fair daughter, or entering a
house from which no one ever returns?"</p>

<p>"My death is fixed for one day,"
said Skirnir, in answer, and his voice,
the voice of an Asa, sounded loud and
clear through the misty air of J&ouml;tunheim.
It reached the ears of the fair Gerda as
she sat in her chamber with her maidens.</p>

<p>"What is that noise of noises," she
said, "that I hear? The earth shakes
with it, and all Gymir's halls tremble."</p>

<p>Then one of the maidens got up, and
peeped out of the window. "I see a
man," she said; "he has dismounted
from his horse, and he is fearlessly letting
it graze before the door."</p>

<p>"Go out and bring him in stealthily,
then," said Gerda; "I must again hear
him speak; for his voice is sweeter than
the ringing of bells."</p>

<p>So the maiden rose, and opened the
house-door softly, lest the grim giant,
Gymir, who was drinking mead in the
banquet-hall with seven other giants,
should hear and come forth.</p>

<p>Skirnir heard the door open, and understanding
the maiden's sign, he entered
with stealthy steps, and followed her to
Gerda's chamber. As soon as he entered
the doorway the light from her face shone
upon him, and he no longer wondered
that Frey had given up his sword.</p>

<p>"Are you the son of an Asa, or an Alf,
or of a wise Van?" asked Gerda; "and
why have you come through flame and
snow to visit our halls?"</p>

<p>Then Skirnir came forward and knelt
at Gerda's feet, and gave his message,
and spoke as he had promised to speak
of Van Frey and of Alfheim.</p>

<p>Gerda listened; and it was pleasant
enough to talk to her, looking into her
bright face; but she did not seem to
understand much of what he said.</p>

<p>He promised to give her eleven golden
apples from Iduna's grove if she would
go with him, and that she should have
the magic ring Draupnir from which
every day a still fairer jewel fell. But
he found there was no use in talking
of beautiful things to one who had never
in all her life seen anything beautiful.
Gerda smiled at him as a child smiles
at a fairy tale.</p>

<p>At length he grew angry. "If you
are so childish, maiden," he said, "that
you can believe only what you have
seen, and have no thought of Aesirland
or the Aesir, then sorrow and utter
darkness shall fall upon you; you shall
live alone on the Eagle Mount turned
towards Hel. Terrors shall beset you;
weeping shall be your lot. Men and
Aesir will hate you, and you shall be
doomed to live for ever with the Frost
Giant, Ryme, in whose cold arms you
will wither away like a thistle on a
house-top."</p>

<p>"Gently," said Gerda, turning away
her bright head, and sighing. "How
am I to blame? You make such a talk
of your Aesir and your Aesir; but how
can I know about it, when all my life
long I have lived with giants?"</p>

<p>At these words, Skirnir rose as if he
would have departed, but Gerda called
him back. "You must drink a cup of
mead," she said, "in return for your
sweet-sounding words."</p>

<p>Skirnir heard this gladly, for now he
knew what he would do. He took the
cup from her hand, drank off the mead,
and, before he returned it, he contrived
cleverly to pour in the water from his
drinking-horn, on which Frey's image
was painted; then he put the cup into
Gerda's hand, and bade her look.</p>

<p>She smiled as she looked; and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
longer she looked, the sweeter grew her
smile; for she looked for the first time
on a face that loved her, and many
things became clear to her that she had
never understood before. Skirnir's words
were no longer like fairy tales. She
could now believe in Aesirland, and in
all beautiful things.</p>

<p>"Go back to your master," she said,
at last, "and tell him that in nine days
I will meet him in the warm wood
Barri."</p>

<p>After hearing these joyful words,
Skirnir made haste to take leave, for
every moment that he lingered in the
giant's house he was in danger. One
of Gerda's maidens conducted him to
the door, and he mounted his horse
again, and rode from J&ouml;tunheim with
a glad heart.</p>


<div class='center'><br />PART IV</div>

<div class='center'>THE WOOD BARRI</div>

<p>When Skirnir got back to Alfheim,
and told Gerda's answer to Frey, he was
disappointed to find that his master did
not immediately look as bright and happy
as he expected.</p>

<p>"Nine days!" he said; "but how can
I wait nine days? One day is long,
and three days are very long, but 'nine
days' might as well be a whole year."</p>

<p>I have heard children say such things
when one tells them to wait for a new toy.</p>

<p>Skirnir and old Ni&ouml;rd only laughed
at it; but Freyja and all the ladies of
Asgard made a journey to Alfheim, when
they heard the story, to comfort Frey,
and hear all the news about the wedding.</p>

<p>"Dear Frey," they said, "it will
never do to lie still here, sighing under
a tree. You are quite mistaken about
the time being long; it is hardly long
enough to prepare the marriage presents,
and talk over the wedding. You have
no idea how busy we are going to be;
everything in Alfheim will have to be
altered a little."</p>

<p>At these words Frey really did lift
up his head, and wake up from his musings.
He looked, in truth, a little frightened
at the thought; but, when all the
Asgard ladies were ready to work for
his wedding, how could he make any
objection? He was not allowed to have
much share in the business himself; but
he had little time, during the nine days,
to indulge in private thought, for never
before was there such a commotion in
Alfheim. The ladies found so many
things that wanted overlooking, and the
little light elves were not of the slightest
use to any one. They forgot all their
usual tasks, and went running about
through groves and fields, and by the
sedgy banks of rivers, peering into earth-holes,
and creeping down into flower-cups
and empty snail-shells, every one hoping
to find a gift for Gerda.</p>

<p>Some stole the light from glowworms'
tails, and wove it into a necklace, and
others pulled the ruby spots from cowslip
leaves, to set with jewels the acorn
cups that Gerda was to drink from;
while the swiftest runners chased the
butterflies, and pulled feathers from
their wings to make fans and bonnet-plumes.</p>

<p>All the work was scarcely finished when
the ninth day came, and Frey set out
from Alfheim with all his elves, to the
warm wood Barri.</p>

<p>The Aesir joined him on the way, and
they made, together, something like a
wedding procession. First came Frey
in his chariot, drawn by Golden Bristles,
and carrying in his hand the wedding ring,
which was none other than Draupnir,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
the magic ring of which so many stories
are told.</p>

<p>Odin and Frigga followed with their
wedding gift, the Ship Skidbladnir, in
which all the Aesir could sit and sail,
though it could afterwards be folded up
so small that you might carry it in your
hand.</p>

<p>Then came Iduna, with eleven golden
apples in a basket on her fair head, and
then two and two all the heroes and
ladies with their gifts.</p>

<p>All round them flocked the elves, toiling
under the weight of their offerings.
It took twenty little people to carry one
gift, and yet there was not one so large
as a baby's finger. Laughing, and singing,
and dancing, they entered the warm
wood, and every summer flower sent a
sweet breath after them. Everything
on earth smiled on the wedding-day of
Frey and Gerda, only&mdash;when it was all
over, and every one had gone home, and
the moon shone cold into the wood&mdash;it
seemed as if the Vanir spoke to one
another.</p>

<p>"Odin," said one voice, "gave his eye
for wisdom, and we have seen that it
was well done."</p>

<p>"Frey," answered the other, "has
given his sword for happiness. It may
be well to be unarmed while the sun
shines and bright days last; but when
Ragnar&ouml;k has come, and the sons of
Muspell ride down to the last fight, will
not Frey regret his sword?"</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_268" id="Note_268">268</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Balder represented sunlight. He was a son
of Odin. If we try to imagine how welcome
the sunlight of spring must have been to
the Norse folk after the long Arctic night of
winter, we may understand why everything
in the world, except the evil Loke, was
willing to weep in order to bring Balder
back from Helheim. Some knowledge of
the geography of Norse mythology will aid
the reader in understanding the myth of
Balder. Far below Asgard, the home of
the gods, was Niflheim, the region of cold
and darkness. Here in a deep cavern was
Helheim, the city of the dead, over which
Hel ruled. Midway between Asgard and
Niflheim was Midgard, the earth. The
whole universe was supported by Ygdrasil,
a wonderful ash-tree, one root of which
extended into Midgard, one into J&ouml;tunheim,
and one into Niflheim.</div>

<div class='hang1'>"Balder is another figure of that radiant type
to which belong all bright and genial heroes,
righters of wrong, blazing to consume evil,
gentle and strong to uplift weakness: Apollo,
Hercules, Perseus, Achilles, Sigard, St.
George, and many another." Balder has
been a favorite subject for poetic treatment,
perhaps to best effect in Matthew Arnold's
dignified "Balder Dead."</div>


<h4>THE DEATH OF BALDER</h4>

<div class='center'>HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE</div>

<p>There was one shadow which always
fell over Asgard. Sometimes in the long
years the gods almost forgot it, it lay so
far off, like a dim cloud in a clear sky;
but Odin saw it deepen and widen as he
looked out into the universe, and he
knew that the last great battle would
surely come, when the gods themselves
would be destroyed and a long twilight
would rest on all the worlds; and now the
day was close at hand. Misfortunes
never come singly to men, and they did
not to the gods. Idun, the beautiful
goddess of youth, whose apples were the
joy of all Asgard, made a resting place
for herself among the massive branches
of Ygdrasil, and there every evening came
Brage, and sang so sweetly that the birds
stopped to listen, and even the Norns,
those implacable sisters at the foot of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the tree, were softened by the melody.
But poetry cannot change the purposes
of fate, and one evening no song was
heard of Brage or birds, the leaves of the
world-tree hung withered and lifeless on
the branches, and the fountain from
which they had daily been sprinkled was
dry at last. Idun had fallen into the
dark valley of death, and when Brage,
Heimdal, and Loke went to question her
about the future she could answer them
only with tears. Brage would not leave
his beautiful wife alone amid the dim
shades that crowded the dreary valley,
and so youth and genius vanished out of
Asgard forever.</p>

<p>Balder was the most god-like of all
the gods, because he was the purest and
the best. Wherever he went his coming
was like the coming of sunshine, and all
the beauty of summer was but the
shining of his face. When men's hearts
were white like the light, and their lives
clear as the day, it was because Balder
was looking down upon them with those
soft, clear eyes that were open windows
to the soul of God. He had always lived
in such a glow of brightness that no
darkness had ever touched him; but one
morning, after Idun and Brage had gone,
Balder's face was sad and troubled. He
walked slowly from room to room in his
palace Breidablik, stainless as the sky
when April showers have swept across it
because no impure thing had ever crossed
the threshold, and his eyes were heavy
with sorrow. In the night terrible
dreams had broken his sleep, and made it
a long torture. The air seemed to be full
of awful changes for him, and for all the
gods. He knew in his soul that the
shadow of the last great day was sweeping
on; as he looked out and saw the
worlds lying in light and beauty, the
fields yellow with waving grain, the deep
fiords flashing back the sunbeams from
their clear depths, the verdure clothing
the loftiest mountains, and knew that
over all this darkness and desolation
would come, with silence of reapers
and birds, with fading of leaf and
flower, a great sorrow fell on his heart.</p>

<p>Balder could bear the burden no
longer. He went out, called all the gods
together, and told them the terrible
dreams of the night. Every face was
heavy with care. The death of Balder
would be like the going out of the sun,
and after a long, sad council the gods
resolved to protect him from harm by
pledging all things to stand between him
and any hurt. So Frigg, his mother,
went forth and made everything promise,
on a solemn oath, not to injure her son.
Fire, iron, all kinds of metal, every sort
of stone, trees, earth, diseases, birds,
beasts, snakes, as the anxious mother
went to them, solemnly pledged themselves
that no harm should come near
Balder. Everything promised, and Frigg
thought she had driven away the cloud;
but fate was stronger than her love, and
one little shrub had not sworn.</p>

<p>Odin was not satisfied even with these
precautions, for whichever way he looked
the shadow of a great sorrow spread over
the worlds. He began to feel as if he
were no longer the greatest of the gods,
and he could almost hear the rough
shouts of the frost-giants crowding the
rainbow bridge on their way into Asgard.
When trouble comes to men it is hard
to bear, but to a god who had so many
worlds to guide and rule it was a new
and terrible thing. Odin thought and
thought until he was weary, but no gleam
of light could he find anywhere; it was
thick darkness everywhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he could bear the suspense no
longer, and saddling his horse he rode
sadly out of Asgard to Niflheim, the
home of Hel, whose face was as the face
of death itself. As he drew near the
gates, a monstrous dog came out and
barked furiously, but Odin rode a little
eastward of the shadowy gates to the
grave of a wonderful prophetess. It was
a cold, gloomy place, and the soul of
the great god was pierced with a feeling
of hopeless sorrow as he dismounted
from Sleipner, and bending over the
grave began to chant weird songs, and
weave magical charms over it. When
he had spoken those wonderful words
which could waken the dead from their
sleep, there was an awful silence for a
moment, and then a faint ghost-like
voice came from the grave.</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" it said. "Who
breaketh the silence of death, and calleth
the sleeper out of her long slumbers?
Ages ago I was laid at rest here, snow
and rain have fallen upon me through
myriad years; why dost thou disturb
me?"</p>

<p>"I am Vegtam," answered Odin,
"and I come to ask why the couches of
Hel are hung with gold and the benches
strewn with shining rings?"</p>

<p>"It is done for Balder," answered the
awful voice; "ask me no more."</p>

<p>Odin's heart sank when he heard these
words; but he was determined to know
the worst.</p>

<p>"I will ask thee until I know all.
Who shall strike the fatal blow?"</p>

<p>"If I must, I must," moaned the
prophetess. "Hoder shall smite his
brother Balder and send him down to
the dark home of Hel. The mead is
already brewed for Balder, and the
despair draweth near."</p>

<p>Then Odin, looking into the future
across the open grave, saw all the days
to come.</p>

<p>"Who is this," he said, seeing that
which no mortal could have seen,&mdash;"who
is this that will not weep for Balder?"</p>

<p>Then the prophetess knew that it was
none other than the greatest of the gods
who had called her up.</p>

<p>"Thou are not Vegtam," she exclaimed,
"thou art Odin himself, the
king of men."</p>

<p>"And thou," answered Odin angrily,
"art no prophetess, but the mother of
three giants."</p>

<p>"Ride home, then, and exult in what
thou hast discovered," said the dead
woman. "Never shall my slumbers be
broken again until Loke shall burst his
chains and the great battle come."</p>

<p>And Odin rode sadly homeward knowing
that already Niflheim was making
itself beautiful against the coming of
Balder.</p>

<p>The other gods meanwhile had become
merry again; for had not everything
promised to protect their beloved Balder?
They even made sport of that which
troubled them, for when they found that
nothing could hurt Balder, and that all
things glanced aside from his shining
form, they persuaded him to stand as a
target for their weapons; hurling darts,
spears, swords, and battle-axes at him,
all of which went singing through the
air and fell harmless at his feet. But
Loke, when he saw these sports, was
jealous of Balder, and went about thinking
how he could destroy him.</p>

<p>It happened that as Frigg sat spinning
in her house Fensal, the soft wind
blowing in at the windows and bringing
the merry shouts of the gods at play, an
old woman entered and approached her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know," asked the newcomer,
"what they are doing in Asgard? They
are throwing all manner of dangerous
weapons at Balder. He stands there like
the sun for brightness, and against his
glory, spears and battle-axes fall powerless
to the ground. Nothing can harm him."</p>

<p>"No," answered Frigg, joyfully;
"nothing can bring him any hurt, for
I have made everything in heaven and
earth swear to protect him."</p>

<p>"What!" said the old woman, "has
everything sworn to guard Balder?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Frigg, "everything has
sworn except one little shrub which is
called Mistletoe, and grows on the eastern
side of Valhal. I did not take an
oath from that because I thought it
too young and weak."</p>

<p>When the old woman heard this a
strange light came into her eyes; she
walked off much faster than she had
come in, and no sooner had she passed
beyond Frigg's sight than this same
feeble old woman grew suddenly erect,
shook off her woman's garments, and
there stood Loke himself. In a moment
he had reached the slope east of Valhal,
had plucked a twig of the unsworn Mistletoe,
and was back in the circle of the
gods, who were still at their favorite
pastime with Balder. Hoder was standing
silent and alone outside the noisy throng,
for he was blind. Loke touched him.</p>

<p>"Why do you not throw something
at Balder?"</p>

<p>"Because I cannot see where Balder
stands, and have nothing to throw if I
could," replied Hoder.</p>

<p>"If that is all," said Loke, "come
with me. I will give you something to
throw, and direct your aim."</p>

<p>Hoder, thinking no evil, went with
Loke and did as he was told.</p>

<p>The little sprig of Mistletoe shot
through the air, pierced the heart of
Balder, and in a moment the beautiful
god lay dead upon the field. A shadow
rose out of the deep beyond the worlds
and spread itself over heaven and
earth, for the light of the universe had
gone out.</p>

<p>The gods could not speak for horror.
They stood like statues for a moment,
and then a hopeless wail burst from their
lips. Tears fell like rain from eyes that
had never wept before, for Balder, the
joy of Asgard, had gone to Niflheim and
left them desolate. But Odin was saddest
of all, because he knew the future,
and he knew that peace and light had
fled from Asgard forever, and that the
last day and the long night were hurrying
on.</p>

<p>Frigg could not give up her beautiful
son, and when her grief had spent itself
a little, she asked who would go to Hel
and offer her a rich ransom if she would
permit Balder to return to Asgard.</p>

<p>"I will go," said Hermod; swift at
the word of Odin, Sleipner was led forth,
and in an instant Hermod was galloping
furiously away.</p>

<p>Then the gods began with sorrowful
hearts to make ready for Balder's funeral.
When the once beautiful form had been
arrayed in grave-clothes they carried it
reverently down to the deep sea, which
lay, calm as a summer afternoon, waiting
for its precious burden. Close to the
water's edge lay Balder's Ringhorn, the
greatest of all the ships that sailed the
seas, but when the gods tried to launch
it they could not move it an inch. The
great vessel creaked and groaned, but no
one could push it down to the water.
Odin walked about it with a sad face,
and the gentle ripple of the little waves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
chasing each other over the rocks seemed
a mocking laugh to him.</p>

<p>"Send to J&ouml;tunheim for Hyrroken,"
he said at last; and a messenger was
soon flying for that mighty giantess.</p>

<p>In a little time, Hyrroken came riding
swiftly on a wolf so large and fierce that
he made the gods think of Fenris. When
the giantess had alighted, Odin ordered
four Berserkers of mighty strength to
hold the wolf, but he struggled so angrily
that they had to throw him on the
ground before they could control him.
Then Hyrroken went to the prow of the
ship and with one mighty effort sent it
far into the sea, the rollers underneath
bursting into flame, and the whole earth
trembling with the shock. Thor was so
angry at the uproar that he would have
killed the giantess on the spot if he had
not been held back by the other gods.
The great ship floated on the sea as she
had often done before, when Balder, full
of life and beauty, set all her sails and
was borne joyfully across the tossing seas.
Slowly and solemnly the dead god was
carried on board, and as Nanna, his
faithful wife, saw her husband borne for
the last time from the earth which he
had made dear to her and beautiful to
all men, her heart broke with sorrow,
and they laid her beside Balder on the
funeral pyre.</p>

<p>Since the world began no one had
seen such a funeral. No bell tolled,
no long procession of mourners moved
across the hills, but all the worlds lay
under a deep shadow, and from every
quarter came those who had loved or
feared Balder. There at the very water's
edge stood Odin himself, the ravens flying
about his head, and on his majestic
face a gloom that no sun would ever
lighten again; and there was Frigg, the
desolate mother, whose son had already
gone so far that he would never come
back to her; there was Frey standing
sad and stern in his chariot; there was
Freyja, the goddess of love, from whose
eyes fell a shining rain of tears; there,
too, was Heimdal on his horse Goldtop;
and around all these glorious ones from
Asgard crowded the children of J&ouml;tunheim,
grim mountain-giants seamed with
scars from Thor's hammer, and frost-giants
who saw in the death of Balder
the coming of that long winter in which
they should reign through all the
worlds.</p>

<p>A deep hush fell on all created things,
and every eye was fixed on the great
ship riding near the shore, and on the
funeral pyre rising from the deck crowned
with the forms of Balder and Nanna.
Suddenly a gleam of light flashed over
the water; the pile had been kindled,
and the flames, creeping slowly at first,
climbed faster and faster until they met
over the dead and rose skyward. A lurid
light filled the heavens and shone on the
sea, and in the brightness of it the gods
looked pale and sad, and the circle of
giants grew darker and more portentous.
Thor struck the fast burning pyre with
his consecrating hammer, and Odin cast
into it the wonderful ring Draupner.
Higher and higher leaped the flames,
more and more desolate grew the scene;
at last they began to sink, the funeral
pyre was consumed. Balder had vanished
forever, the summer was ended,
and winter waited at the doors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hermod was riding hard
and fast on his gloomy errand. Nine
days and nights he rode through valleys
so deep and dark that he could not see
his horse. Stillness and blackness and
solitude were his only companions until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
he came to the golden bridge which
crosses the river Gjol. The good horse
Sleipner, who had carried Odin on so
many strange journeys, had never traveled
such a road before, and his hoofs
rang drearily as he stopped short at the
bridge, for in front of him stood its
porter, the gigantic Modgud.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked, fixing her
piercing eyes on Hermod. "What is
your name and parentage? Yesterday
five bands of dead men rode across the
bridge, and beneath them all it did not
shake as under your single tread. There
is no color of death in your face. Why
ride you hither, the living among the
dead?"</p>

<p>"I come," said Hermod, "to seek for
Balder. Have you seen him pass this
way?"</p>

<p>"He has already crossed the bridge
and taken his journey northward to Hel."</p>

<p>Then Hermod rode slowly across the
bridge that spans the abyss between life
and death, and found his way at last to
the barred gates of Hel's dreadful home.
There he sprang to the ground, tightened
the girths, remounted, drove the spurs
deep into the horse, and Sleipner, with
a mighty leap, cleared the wall. Hermod
rode straight to the gloomy palace, dismounted,
entered, and in a moment was
face to face with the terrible queen of
the kingdom of the dead. Beside her,
on a beautiful throne, sat Balder, pale
and wan, crowned with a withered wreath
of flowers, and close at hand was Nanna,
pallid as her husband, for whom she had
died. And all night long, while ghostly
forms wandered restless and sleepless
through Helheim, Hermod talked with
Balder and Nanna. There is no record
of what they said, but the talk was sad
enough, doubtless, and ran like a still
stream among the happy days in Asgard
when Balder's smile was morning over
the earth and the sight of his face the
summer of the world.</p>

<p>When the morning came, faint and
dim, through the dusky palace, Hermod
sought Hel, who received him as cold
and stern as fate.</p>

<p>"Your kingdom is full, O Hel!" he
said, "and without Balder, Asgard is
empty. Send him back to us once
more, for there is sadness in every heart
and tears are in every eye. Through
heaven and earth all things weep for
him."</p>

<p>"If that is true," was the slow, icy
answer, "if every created thing weeps
for Balder, he shall return to Asgard;
but if one eye is dry he remains henceforth
in Helheim."</p>

<p>Then Hermod rode swiftly away, and
the decree of Hel was soon told in
Asgard. Through all the worlds the
gods sent messengers to say that all
who loved Balder should weep for his
return, and everywhere tears fell like
rain. There was weeping in Asgard, and
in all the earth there was nothing that
did not weep. Men and women and
little children, missing the light that had
once fallen into their hearts and homes,
sobbed with bitter grief; the birds of
the air, who had sung carols of joy at
the gates of the morning since time began,
were full of sorrow; the beasts of the
fields crouched and moaned in their
desolation; the great trees, that had put
on their robes of green at Balder's command,
sighed as the wind wailed through
them; and the sweet flowers, that waited
for Balder's footstep and sprang up in
all the fields to greet him, hung their
frail blossoms and wept bitterly for the
love and the warmth and the light that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
had gone out. Throughout the whole
earth there was nothing but weeping,
and the sound of it was like the wailing
of those storms in autumn that weep
for the dead summer as its withered
leaves drop one by one from the trees.</p>

<p>The messengers of the gods went gladly
back to Asgard, for everything had wept
for Balder; but as they journeyed they
came upon a giantess, called Thok, and
her eyes were dry.</p>

<p>"Weep for Balder," they said.</p>

<p>"With dry eyes only will I weep for
Balder," she answered. "Dead or alive,
he never gave me gladness. Let him
stay in Helheim."</p>

<p>When she had spoken these words a
terrible laugh broke from her lips, and
the messengers looked at each other with
pallid faces, for they knew it was the
voice of Loke.</p>

<p>Balder never came back to Asgard,
and the shadows deepened over all things,
for the night of death was fast coming on.</p>

<h2>SECTION VII. POETRY</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p>Many teachers have more difficulty in interesting their pupils in poetry than
in any other form of literature. This difficulty may be due to any one of a number
of causes. It may be due to a lack of poetic appreciation on the part of the teacher,
leading to poor judgment in selecting and presenting poetry. It may be due to the
feeling that there is something occult and mysterious about poetry that puts it outside
the range of common interests, or to the idea that the technique of verse must
in some way be emphasized. The first step in using poetry successfully with children
is to brush away all these and other extraneous matters and to realize that poetry is
in essence a simple and natural mode of expression, and that all attempts to explain
how poetry does its work may be left for later stages of study. It is not necessary
even for the teacher to be able to recognize and name all the varieties of rhythm to
be able to present poetry enthusiastically and understandingly. Least of all is it
necessary to have a prescribed list of the hundred "best poems." Some of the best
poems for children would not belong in any such list.</p>

<p>The selections in this section cover a wide variety. They are not all equally
great, but no teacher can fail to find here something suitable and interesting for
any grade. The few suggestions which it is possible to make in this brief introduction
may best, perhaps, and without any intention of being exhaustive, be thrown
into the form of dogmatic statements:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. If in doubt about what to use beyond the material in the following pages,
depend upon some of the fine collections mentioned in the bibliography. Every
teacher should have access to Stevenson's <i>Home Book of Verse for Young Folks</i>,
which contains many poems from recent writers as well as the older favorites.
If possible, have the advantage of the fine taste and judgment of the collections
made by Andrew Lang, Miss Repplier, E. V. Lucas, and as many of the others
as are available.</p>

<p>2. Remember that in poetry, more than elsewhere, one can present only
what one is really interested in and, as a consequence, enthusiastic about. Even
poems about whose fitness all judges agree should be omitted rather than run
the risk of deadening them for children by a dead and formal handling.</p>

<p>3. Mainly, poetry should be presented orally. The appeal is first to the ear
just as in music. The teacher should read or, better, recite the poem in order
to get the best results. There should be no effort at "elocution" in its worst
sense, but a simple, sincere rendering of the language of the poem. The more
informal the process is, the better. There should be much repetition of favorite
poems, so that the rich details and pictures may sink into the mind.</p>

<p>4. There should be great variety in choice that richness and breadth of impression
may thus be gained. It is a mistake to confine the work in poetry entirely
to lyrics or entirely to ballads. Wordsworth's "Daffodils" and Gilbert's "Yarn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
of the Nancy Bell" are far apart, but there is a place for each. Teachers
should always be on the lookout for poetry old or new, in the magazines or elsewhere,
which they can bring into the schoolroom. Such "finds" are often fresh
with some timely suggestion and may prove just what is needed to start some
hesitating pupil to reading poetry.</p>

<p>5. The earliest poetry should be that in which the music is very prominent
and the idea absent or not prominent. The perfection of the Mother Goose
jingles for little folks is in their fulfillment of this principle. Use and encourage
strongly emphasized rhythm in reading poetry, especially in the early work.
Gradually the meaning in poetry takes on more prominence as the work proceeds.</p>

<p>6. Children should be encouraged to commit much poetry to memory. They
do this very easily after hearing it repeated a time or two. Such memorizing
should not be done usually as a task. Children are, however, very obliging
about liking what a teacher is enthusiastic about, and what they like they can
hold in mind with surprising ease. The game of giving quotations that no
one else in the class has given is always a delight. Don't be misled by the fun
poked at the "memory gem method" of studying poetry. The error is not in
memorizing complete poems and fine poetic passages, but in doing this in a
mechanical fashion.</p>

<p>7. It is a mistake to use too much poetry at one time. Children, as well
as grown people, tire of it more quickly than they do of prose. The mind seems
soon to reach the saturation point where it is unable to take in any more. Frequent
returns to a poem rather than long periods of study give the best results.</p>

<p>8. Encourage children to read poetry aloud. By example and suggestion
help them keep their minds on the ideas, the pictures, the characters. Only
by doing this can they really read so as to interpret a poem. No one can read
with a lazy mind, or merely by imitation. Encourage them to croon or recite
the lines when alone.</p>

<p>9. It is not necessary that children should understand everything in a poem.
If it is worth while they will get enough of its meaning to justify its use and
they will gradually see more and more in it as time passes. In fact it is this
constantly growing content of a poem that makes its possession in memory
such a treasure. Neither should the presence of difficult words be allowed to
rule out a poem that possesses some large element of accessible value. Many
words are understood by the ear that are not recognized by sight.</p></div>


<h3><br />SUGGESTIONS FOR READING</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Books such as Woodberry's <i>Heart of Man</i> and <i>Appreciation of Literature</i> are of especial value
for getting the right attitude toward poetry. The most illuminating practical help would come from
consulting the published lectures of Lafcadio Hearn, explaining poetry to Japanese students. His
problem was not unlike that faced by the teacher of poetry in the grades. These lectures have
been edited by John Erskine as <i>Interpretations of Literature</i> (2 vols.), <i>Appreciations of Poetry</i>, and
<i>Life and Literature</i>. The whole philosophy of poetry is treated compactly in Professor Gayley's
"The Principles of Poetry," which forms the introduction to Gayley and Young's <i>Principles and
Progress of English Poetry</i>.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<div class="hang1">Mrs. Follen (1787-1860) was a rather voluminous
writer and adapter of juvenile
material. Her verses are old-fashioned,
simple, and child-like, and have pleased
several generations of children. While they
have no such air of distinction as belongs
to Stevenson's poems for children, they
are full of the fancies that children enjoy,
and deserve their continued popularity.</div>


<h4><br />THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS</h4>

<div class='center'>ELIZA LEE FOLLEN<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Three little kittens lost their mittens;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they began to cry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh, mother dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We very much fear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That we have lost our mittens."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Lost your mittens!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You naughty kittens!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then you shall have no pie!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"No, you shall have no pie."</span><br />
<br />
The three little kittens found their mittens;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they began to cry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh, mother dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">See here, see here!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See, we have found our mittens!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Put on your mittens,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You silly kittens,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And you may have some pie."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, let us have the pie!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r."</span><br />
<br />
The three little kittens put on their mittens,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And soon ate up the pie;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh, mother dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We greatly fear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That we have soiled our mittens!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Soiled your mittens!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You naughty kittens!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then they began to sigh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then they began to sigh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow."</span><br />
<br />
The three little kittens washed their mittens,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hung them out to dry;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Oh, mother dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Do not you hear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That we have washed our mittens?"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Washed your mittens!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh, you're good kittens!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I smell a rat close by;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hush, hush! Mee-ow, mee-ow."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"We smell a rat close by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow."</span><br />

O look at the moon!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She is shining up there;</span><br />
O mother, she looks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a lamp in the air.</span><br />
<br />
Last week she was smaller,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shaped like a bow;</span><br />
But now she's grown bigger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And round as an O.</span><br />
<br />
Pretty moon, pretty moon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How you shine on the door,</span><br />
And make it all bright<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On my nursery floor!</span><br />
<br />
You shine on my playthings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And show me their place,</span><br />
And I love to look up<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At your pretty bright face.</span><br />
<br />
And there is a star<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Close by you, and maybe</span><br />
That small twinkling star<br />

"Stop, stop, pretty water!"<br />

<br />
"You run on so fast!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wish you would stay;</span><br />
My boat and my flowers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You will carry away.</span><br />

"But I will run after:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mother says that I may;</span><br />
For I would know where<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You are running away."</span><br />
<br />
So Mary ran on;<br />

That she never could find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the brook ran away.</span><br />

<div class="hang1">Mrs. Prentiss (1818-1878) was the author of
<i>The Susy Books</i>, published from 1853 to
1856, forerunners of many series of such
juvenile publications. The following poem
has retained its hold on the affections of
children.</div>


<h4><br />THE LITTLE KITTY</h4>

<div class='center'>ELIZABETH PRENTISS<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Once there was a little kitty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whiter than snow;</span><br />
In a barn she used to frolic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long time ago.</span><br />
<br />
In the barn a little mousie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ran to and fro;</span><br />
For she heard the kitty coming,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long time ago.</span><br />
<br />
Two eyes had little kitty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Black as a sloe;</span><br />
And they spied the little mousie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long time ago.</span><br />
<br />
Four paws had little kitty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Paws soft as dough;</span><br />
And they caught the little mousie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long time ago.</span><br />
<br />
Nine teeth had little kitty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All in a row;</span><br />
And they bit the little mousie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long time ago.</span><br />
<br />
When the teeth bit little mousie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little mouse cried, "Oh!"</span><br />
But she got away from kitty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long time ago.</span><br />

<div class="hang1">Mrs. Hale (1788-1879), left a widow with
five children to support, devoted herself
to a literary career. She wrote fiction,
edited the <i>Ladies' Magazine</i> of Boston,
afterward the <i>Ladies' Book</i> of Philadelphia,
compiled a book of poetical quotations, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
biographies of celebrated women. Most
of her work was ephemeral in character,
and she lives for us in the one poem that
follows. It is usually printed without the

moralizing.</div>


<h4><br />MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB</h4>

<div class='center'>SARA J. HALE<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Mary had a little lamb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its fleece was white as snow,</span><br />
And everywhere that Mary went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lamb was sure to go.</span><br />
<br />
He followed her to school one day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That was against the rule;</span><br />
It made the children laugh and play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see a lamb at school.</span><br />
<br />
And so the Teacher turned him out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But still he lingered near,</span><br />
And waited patiently about,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till Mary did appear:</span><br />
<br />
And then he ran to her, and laid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His head upon her arm,</span><br />
As if he said, "I'm not afraid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You'll save me from all harm."</span><br />
<br />
"What makes the lamb love Mary so?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The eager children cry&mdash;</span><br />
"Oh, Mary loves the lamb, you know,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Teacher did reply.</span><br />
<br />
And you each gentle animal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In confidence may bind,</span><br />
And make them follow at your will,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If you are only kind.</span><br />

<div class="hang1">Theodore Tilton (1835-1907) was a very
brilliant New York orator, poet, and
journalist. His poetry, published in a
complete volume in 1897, contains some
really distinguished verse. He is largely
known to the new generation, however, by
some stanzas from the following poem,
which are usually found in readers and
poetic compilations for children. The
entire poem is given here. Does our

negate the kindly attitude emphasized in
the poem?</div>


<h4><br />BABY BYE</h4>

<div class='center'>THEODORE TILTON<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Baby bye,<br />
Here's a fly;<br />
Let us watch him, you and I.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How he crawls</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Up the walls,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet he never falls!</span><br />
I believe with six such legs<br />
You and I could walk on eggs.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There he goes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On his toes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tickling baby's nose.</span><br />
<br />
Spots of red<br />
Dot his head;<br />
Rainbows on his back are spread;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That small speck</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is his neck;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">See him nod and beck.</span><br />
I can show you, if you choose,<br />
Where to look to find his shoes,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Three small pairs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Made of hairs;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">These he always wears.</span><br />
<br />
Black and brown<br />
Is his gown;<br />
He can wear it upside down;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It is laced</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Round his waist;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I admire his taste.</span><br />
Yet though tight his clothes are made<br />
He will lose them, I'm afraid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If to-night</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He gets sight</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of the candle-light.</span><br />
<br />
In the sun<br />
Webs are spun;<br />
What if he gets into one?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When it rains</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He complains</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the window-panes.</span><br />
Tongue to talk have you and I;<br />
God has given the little fly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No such things,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So he sings</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With his buzzing wings.</span><br />
<br />
He can eat<br />
Bread and meat;<br />
There's his mouth between his feet.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On his back</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is a pack</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like a pedler's sack.</span><br />
Does the baby understand?<br />
Then the fly shall kiss her hand;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Put a crumb</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On her thumb,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Maybe he will come.</span><br />
<br />
Catch him? No,<br />
Let him go,<br />
Never hurt an insect so;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But no doubt</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He flies out</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Just to gad about.</span><br />
Now you see his wings of silk<br />
Drabbled in the baby's milk;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fie, oh fie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Foolish fly!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How will he get dry?</span><br />
<br />
All wet flies<br />
Twist their thighs,<br />
Thus they wipe their head and eyes;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cats, you know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wash just so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then their whiskers grow.</span><br />
Flies have hair too short to comb,<br />
So they fly bareheaded home;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But the gnat</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wears a hat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Do you believe that?</span><br />
<br />
Flies can see<br />
More than we.<br />
So how bright their eyes must be!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Little fly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ope your eye;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Spiders are near by.</span><br />
For a secret I can tell,&mdash;<br />
Spiders never use flies well.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then away!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Do not stay.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Little fly, good-day!</span><br />

autobiography called <i>A New England

And what does he say, little girl, little boy?<br />
"Oh, the world's running over with joy!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Don't you hear? Don't you see?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hush! Look! In my tree</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>I'm as happy as happy can be!"<br />
<br />
And the brown thrush keeps singing, "A nest do you see,<br />
And five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree?<br />
Don't meddle! Don't touch! little girl, little boy,<br />
Or the world will lose some of its joy!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now I'm glad! Now I'm free!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I always shall be,</span><br />
If you never bring sorrow to me."<br />
<br />
So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,<br />
To you and to me, to you and to me.<br />
And he sings all the day, little girl, little boy,<br />
"Oh, the world's running over with joy!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But long it won't be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Don't you know? don't you see?</span><br />
Unless we are as good as can be.<br />

<div class="hang1">Mrs. Child (1802-1880) was the editor of
the first monthly for children in the United
States, the <i>Juvenile Miscellany</i>. She wrote
and compiled several works for children,
and her optimistic outlook has led someone
to speak of her as the "Apostle of Cheer."
She wrote a novel, <i>Hobomak</i> (1821), which
is still spoken of with respect, and she was
a prominent figure in the anti-slavery
agitation. The two poems following have
held their own with children for reasons
easily recognized.</div>


<h4><br />THANKSGIVING DAY</h4>

<div class='center'>LYDIA MARIA CHILD<br /><br /></div>

Over the river and through the wood,<br />

Over the river and through the wood&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, how the wind does blow!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It stings the toes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And bites the nose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As over the ground we go.</span><br />
<br />
Over the river and through the wood,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We seem to go</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Extremely slow,</span><br />

<br />
Over the river and through the wood&mdash;<br />

<h3><br />WHO STOLE THE BIRD'S

"Bob-o'-link! Bob-o'-link!<br />

Who stole a nest away<br />
From the plum-tree, to-day?"<br />

<br />
"To-whit! to-whit! to-whee!<br />

<div class="hang1">"Susan Coolidge" was the pseudonym used
by Sarah C. Woolsey (1845-1905). She
wrote numerous tales and verses for young
people, and her series of <i>Katy Books</i> was
widely known and enjoyed. The poem
that follows is a very familiar one, and its
treatment of its theme may be compared
with that in Henry Ward Beecher's little
prose apologue (No. <a href="#Note_249">249</a>).</div>


<h4><br />HOW THE LEAVES CAME
DOWN</h4>

<div class='center'>"SUSAN COOLIDGE"</div>

<div class='poem'>
I'll tell you how the leaves came down:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The great Tree to his children said,</span><br />
"You're getting sleepy, Yellow and Brown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yes, very sleepy, little Red;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is quite time to go to bed."</span><br />
<br />
"Ah!" begged each silly, pouting leaf,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Let us a little longer stay;</span><br />
Dear Father Tree, behold our grief!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis such a very pleasant day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We do not want to go away."</span><br />
<br />
So, just for one more merry day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the great Tree the leaflets clung,</span><br />
Frolicked and danced and had their way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the autumn breezes swung,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whispering all their sports among,</span><br />
<br />
"Perhaps the great Tree will forget<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And let us stay until the spring,</span><br />
If we all beg and coax and fret."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the great Tree did no such thing;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He smiled to hear their whispering.</span><br />
<br />
"Come, children all, to bed," he cried;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ere the leaves could urge their prayer,</span><br />
He shook his head, and far and wide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fluttering and rustling everywhere,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down sped the leaflets through the air.</span><br />
<br />
I saw them; on the ground they lay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Golden and red, a huddled swarm,</span><br />
Waiting till one from far away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">White bedclothes heaped up on her arm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should come to wrap them safe and warm.</span><br />
<br />
The great bare Tree looked down and smiled.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Good-night, dear little leaves," he said;</span><br />
And from below each sleepy child<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Replied, "Good-night," and murmur&egrave;d,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It is <i>so</i> nice to go to bed."</span><br />
<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class="hang1">The poems for young readers produced by
the sisters Alice Cary (1820-1871) and
Phoebe Cary (1824-1871) constitute the
most successful body of juvenile verse yet
produced in this country. One of Alice
Cary's poems, "An Order for a Picture,"
is of a very distinguished quality, but as
its appeal is largely to mature readers, two
of Phoebe Cary's poems of simpler quality
are chosen for use here. The first of these
marks, by means of three illustrations
within the range of children's observation,
a very common defect of child nature and
is, by the force of these illustrations, a
good lesson in practical ethics. The appeal
of the second is to that inherent ideal of
disinterested heroism which is so strong in
children. The setting of the story amidst
the ever-present threat of the sea affords a
good chance for the teacher to do effective
work in emphasizing the geographical background.
This should be done, however,
not as geography merely, but with the
attention on the human elements involved.</div>

<h4><br />THEY DIDN'T THINK</h4>

<div class='center'>PHOEBE CARY<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Once a trap was baited<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a piece of cheese;</span><br />
Which tickled so a little mouse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It almost made him sneeze;</span><br />
An old rat said, "There's danger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be careful where you go!"</span><br />
"Nonsense!" said the other,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I don't think you know!"</span><br />
So he walked in boldly&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nobody in sight;</span><br />
First he took a nibble,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he took a bite;</span><br />
Close the trap together<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Snapped as quick as wink,</span><br />
Catching mousey fast there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Cause he didn't think.</span><br />
<br />
Once a little turkey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fond of her own way,</span><br />
Wouldn't ask the old ones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where to go or stay;</span><br />
She said, "I'm not a baby,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here I am half-grown;</span><br />
Surely, I am big enough<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To run about alone!"</span><br />
Off she went, but somebody<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hiding saw her pass;</span><br />
Soon like snow her feathers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Covered all the grass.</span><br />
So she made a supper<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a sly young mink,</span><br />
'Cause she was so headstrong<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That she wouldn't think.</span><br />
<br />
Once there was a robin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lived outside the door,</span><br />
Who wanted to go inside<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hop upon the floor.</span><br />
"Ho, no," said the mother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You must stay with me;</span><br />
Little birds are safest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sitting in a tree."</span><br />
"I don't care," said Robin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gave his tail a fling,</span><br />
"I don't think the old folks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Know quite everything."</span><br />
Down he flew, and Kitty seized him.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before he'd time to blink.</span><br />
"Oh," he cried, "I'm sorry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I didn't think."</span><br />
<br />
Now my little children,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You who read this song,</span><br />
Don't you see what trouble<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comes of thinking wrong?</span><br />
And can't you take a warning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From their dreadful fate</span><br />
Who began their thinking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When it was too late?</span><br />
Don't think there's always safety<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where no danger shows,</span><br />
Don't suppose you know more<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than anybody knows;</span><br />
But when you're warned of ruin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pause upon the brink,</span><br />
And don't go under headlong,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Cause you didn't think.</span><br />

<h4><br />THE LEAK IN THE DIKE</h4>

<div class='center'>A Story of Holland<br />
<br />
PHOEBE CARY<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
The good dame looked from her cottage<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the close of the pleasant day,</span><br />
And cheerily called to her little son<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Outside the door at play:</span><br />
"Come, Peter, come! I want you to go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While there is light to see,</span><br />
To the hut of the blind old man who lives<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Across the dike, for me;</span><br />
And take these cakes I made for him&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They are hot and smoking yet;</span><br />
You have time enough to go and come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before the sun is set."</span><br />
<br />
Then the good-wife turned to her labor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Humming a simple song,</span><br />
And thought of her husband, working hard<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the sluices all day long;</span><br />
And set the turf a-blazing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And brought the coarse black bread;</span><br />
That he might find a fire at night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And find the table spread.</span><br />
<br />
And Peter left the brother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With whom all day he had played,</span><br />
And the sister who had watched their sports<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the willow's tender shade;</span><br />
And told them they'd see him back before<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They saw a star in sight,</span><br />
Though he wouldn't be afraid to go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the very darkest night!</span><br />
<br />
For he was a brave, bright fellow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With eye and conscience clear;</span><br />
He could do whatever a boy might do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he had not learned to fear.</span><br />
Why, he wouldn't have robbed a bird's nest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor brought a stork to harm,</span><br />
Though never a law in Holland<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had stood to stay his arm!</span><br />
<br />
And now, with his face all glowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And eyes as bright as the day</span><br />
With the thoughts of his pleasant errand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He trudged along the way;</span><br />
And soon his joyous prattle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made glad a lonesome place&mdash;</span><br />
Alas! if only the blind old man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could have seen that happy face!</span><br />
Yet he somehow caught the brightness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which his voice and presence lent;</span><br />
And he felt the sunshine come and go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As Peter came and went.</span><br />
<br />
And now, as the day was sinking,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the winds began to rise,</span><br />
The mother looked from her door again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shading her anxious eyes;</span><br />
And saw the shadows deepen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And birds to their homes come back,</span><br />
But never a sign of Peter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along the level track.</span><br />
But she said: "He will come at morning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So I need not fret or grieve&mdash;</span><br />
Though it isn't like my boy at all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To stay without my leave."</span><br />
<br />
But where was the child delaying?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the homeward way was he,</span><br />
And across the dike while the sun was up<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An hour above the sea.</span><br />
He was stopping now to gather flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now listening to the sound,</span><br />
As the angry waters dashed themselves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against their narrow bound.</span><br />
<br />
"Ah! well for us," said Peter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"That the gates are good and strong,</span><br />
And my father tends them carefully,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or they would not hold you long!</span><br />
You're a wicked sea," said Peter;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I know why you fret and chafe;</span><br />
You would like to spoil our lands and homes;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But our sluices keep you safe!"</span><br />
<br />
But hark! Through the noise of waters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comes a low, clear, trickling sound;</span><br />
And the child's face pales with terror,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his blossoms drop to the ground.</span><br />
He is up the bank in a moment,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And stealing through the sand,</span><br />
He sees a stream not yet so large<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As his slender, childish hand.</span><br />
<br />
'<i>Tis a leak in the dike!</i> He is but a boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unused to fearful scenes;</span><br />
But, young as he is, he has learned to know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dreadful thing that means.</span><br />
<i>A leak in the dike!</i> The stoutest heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grows faint that cry to hear,</span><br />
And the bravest man in all the land<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turns white with mortal fear.</span><br />
For he knows the smallest leak may grow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a flood in a single night;</span><br />
And he knows the strength of the cruel sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When loosed in its angry might.</span><br />
<br />
And the boy! He has seen the danger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, shouting a wild alarm,</span><br />
He forces back the weight of the sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the strength of his single arm!</span><br />
He listens for the joyful sound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a footstep passing nigh;</span><br />
And lays his ear to the ground, to catch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The answer to his cry.</span><br />
And he hears the rough winds blowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the waters rise and fall,</span><br />
But never an answer comes to him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Save the echo of his call.</span><br />
He sees no hope, no succor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His feeble voice is lost;</span><br />
Yet what shall he do but watch and wait,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though he perish at his post!</span><br />
<br />
So, faintly calling and crying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the sun is under the sea;</span><br />
Crying and moaning till the stars<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come out for company;</span><br />
He thinks of his brother and sister,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Asleep in their safe warm bed;</span><br />
He thinks of his father and mother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of himself as dying&mdash;and dead;</span><br />
And of how, when the night is over,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They must come and find him at last:</span><br />
But he never thinks he can leave the place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where duty holds him fast.</span><br />
<br />
The good dame in the cottage<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is up and astir with the light,</span><br />
For the thought of her little Peter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has been with her all night.</span><br />
And now she watches the pathway,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As yester eve she had done;</span><br />
But what does she see so strange and black<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against the rising sun?</span><br />
Her neighbors are bearing between them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Something straight to her door;</span><br />
Her child is coming home, but not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he ever came before!</span><br />
<br />
"He is dead!" she cries; "my darling!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the startled father hears,</span><br />
And comes and looks the way she looks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fears the thing she fears:</span><br />
Till a glad shout from the bearers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thrills the stricken man and wife&mdash;</span><br />
"Give thanks, for your son has saved our land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And God has saved his life!"</span><br />
So, there in the morning sunshine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They knelt about the boy;</span><br />
And every head was bared and bent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In tearful, reverent joy.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis many a year since then; but still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the sea roars like a flood,</span><br />
Their boys are taught what a boy can do<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who is brave and true and good.</span><br />
For every man in that country<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Takes his son by the hand,</span><br />
And tells him of little Peter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose courage saved the land.</span><br />
<br />
They have many a valiant hero,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remembered through the years:</span><br />
But never one whose name so oft<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is named with loving tears.</span><br />
And his deed shall be sung by the cradle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And told to the child on the knee,</span><br />
So long as the dikes of Holland<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Divide the land from the sea!</span><br />

<div class="hang1">The world's greatest writer of verse for
children, Robert Louis Stevenson, was
born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1850.
After he was twenty-five years old he spent
much of the rest of his short life traveling in
search of health. From 1889 to the time
of his death in 1894 he resided in Samoa.
The verses given here (Nos. <a href="#Note_282">282</a>-<a href="#Note_295">295</a>) are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
taken from his famous book, <i>A Child's
Garden of Verses</i>, which, says Professor
Saintsbury, "is, perhaps, the most perfectly
natural book of the kind. It was
supplemented later by other poems for
children; and some of his work outside
this, culminating in the widely known epitaph</div>

<div class='poem'>
Home is the sailor, home from sea,<br />
And the hunter home from the hill,<br />
</div>

<div class='hang1'><br />has the rarely combined merits of simplicity,
sincerity, music, and strength."
One of the best of Stevenson's poems for
children outside the <i>Child's Garden of
Verses</i> is the powerfully dramatic story
called <i>Heather Ale</i>. In attempting to
solve the secret of Stevenson's supremacy,
Edmund Gosse calls attention to the
"curiously candid and confidential attitude
of mind" in these poems, to the
"extraordinary clearness and precision
with which the immature fancies of eager
childhood" are reproduced, and particularly,
to the fact that they give us "a
transcript of that child-mind which we
have all possessed and enjoyed, but of
which no one, except Mr. Stevenson, seems
to have carried away a photograph." It
is this ability to hand on a photographic
transcript of the child's way of seeing things
that, according to Mr. Gosse, puts Stevenson
in a class which contains only two other
members, Hans Christian Andersen in
nursery stories, and Juliana Horatia Ewing
in the more realistic prose tale. Children
find expressed in these poems their own
active fancies. It has been objected to
them that the child pictured there is a
lonely child, but every child, like every
mature person, has an inner world of dreams
and experiences in which he delights now
and then to dwell. The presence of the
qualities mentioned put at least two of
Stevenson's prose romances among the
most splendid adventure stories for young
people, <i>Treasure Island</i> and <i>Kidnapped</i>.
Perhaps no book is more popular among
pupils of the seventh and eighth grades
than the former. It has been called a
"sublimated dime novel," that is, it has
all the decidedly attractive features of
the "dime novel" plus the fine art of story-telling
which is always lacking in that
sensational type of story.</div>

All in the pleasant open air,<br />

And blown by all the winds that pass<br />

She walks among the meadow grass<br />

<h4><br />A GOOD PLAY</h4>

<div class='poem'>
We built a ship upon the stairs<br />
All made of the back-bedroom chairs,<br />
And filled it full of sofa pillows<br />
To go a-sailing on the billows.<br />
<br />
We took a saw and several nails,<br />
And water in the nursery pails;<br />
And Tom said, "Let us also take<br />
An apple and a slice of cake;"&mdash;<br />
Which was enough for Tom and me<br />
To go a-sailing on, till tea.<br />
<br />
We sailed along for days and days,<br />
And had the very best of plays;<br />
But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,<br />
So there was no one left but me.<br />

<br />
Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,<br />
And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;<br />
But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,<br />
O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!<br />
<br />
For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,<br />
And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;<br />
And O! before you hurry by with ladder and with light,<br />
O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night!<br />

From breakfast on through all the day<br />
At home among my friends I stay,<br />
But every night I go abroad<br />

All by myself I have to go,<br />
With none to tell me what to do&mdash;<br />
All alone beside the streams<br />
And up the mountain sides of dreams.<br />
<br />
The strangest things are there for me,<br />
Both things to eat and things to see,<br />
And many frightening sights abroad,<br />
Till morning in the land of Nod.<br />

Try as I like to find the way,<br />
I never can get back by day,<br />
Nor can remember plain and clear<br />
The curious music that I hear.<br />

<div class='poem'>
At evening when the lamp is lit,<br />
Around the fire my parents sit;<br />
They sit at home and talk and sing,<br />
And do not play at anything.<br />
<br />
Now, with my little gun, I crawl<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>All in the dark along the wall,<br />
And follow round the forest track<br />
Away behind the sofa back.<br />
<br />
There, in the night, where none can spy,<br />
All in my hunter's camp I lie,<br />
And play at books that I have read<br />
Till it is time to go to bed.<br />
<br />
These are the hills, these are the woods,<br />
These are my starry solitudes;<br />
And there the river by whose brink<br />
The roaring lion comes to drink.<br />
<br />
I see the others far away<br />
As if in firelit camp they lay,<br />
And I, like to an Indian scout,<br />
Around their party prowled about.<br />
<br />
So when my nurse comes in for me,<br />
Home I return across the sea,<br />
And go to bed with backward looks<br />
At my dear Land of Story-books.<br />

<h4><br />MY BED IS A BOAT</h4>

<div class='center'>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
My bed is like a little boat;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nurse helps me in when I embark:</span><br />
She girds me in my sailor's coat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And starts me in the dark.</span><br />
<br />
At night, I go on board and say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Good-night to all my friends on shore;</span><br />
I shut my eyes and sail away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And see and hear no more.</span><br />
<br />
And sometimes things to bed I take,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As prudent sailors have to do;</span><br />
Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perhaps a toy or two.</span><br />
<br />
All night across the dark we steer;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when the day returns at last,</span><br />
Safe in my room, beside the pier,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I find my vessel fast.</span><br />

<h4><br />MY SHADOW</h4>

<div class='center'>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,<br />
And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.<br />
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;<br />
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.<br />
<br />
The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow&mdash;<br />
Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;<br />
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,<br />
And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.<br />
<br />
He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,<br />
And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.<br />
He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;<br />
I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!<br />
<br />
One morning, very early, before the sun was up,<br />
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;<br />
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,<br />
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.<br />

<div class='center'>FRANK DEMPSTER SHERMAN<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Long ago there lived a King<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A mighty man and bold,</span><br />
Who had two sons, named Dong and Ding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of whom this tale is told.</span><br />
<br />
Prince Ding was clear of voice, and tall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Prince in every line;</span><br />
Prince Dong, his voice was very small,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he but four feet nine.</span><br />
<br />
Now both these sons were very dear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Bell, the mighty King.</span><br />
They always hastened to appear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he for them would ring.</span><br />
<br />
Ding never failed the first to be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Dong, he followed well,</span><br />
And at the second summons he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Responded to King Bell.</span><br />
<br />
This promptness of each royal Prince<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is all of them we know,</span><br />
Except that all their kindred since<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have done exactly so.</span><br />
<br />
And if you chance to know a King<br />

Across the sky the Moon will go;<br />
It is a lady, sweet and fair,<br />
Who comes to gather daisies there.<br />
<br />
For, when at morning I arise,<br />
There's not a star left in the skies;<br />
She's picked them all and dropped them down<br />
Into the meadows of the town.<br /><br /><br />

<h4><br />WYNKEN, BLYNKEN, AND NOD</h4>

<div class='center'>EUGENE FIELD<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sailed off in a wooden shoe,&mdash;</span><br />
Sailed on a river of crystal light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into a sea of dew.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>"Where are you going, and what do you wish?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old moon asked the three.</span><br />
"We have come to fish for the herring fish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That live in this beautiful sea;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nets of silver and gold have we!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Said Wynken,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Blynken,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And Nod.</span><br />
<br />
The old moon laughed and sang a song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they rocked in the wooden shoe;</span><br />
And the wind that sped them all night long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ruffled the waves of dew.</span><br />
The little stars were the herring fish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That lived in that beautiful sea&mdash;</span><br />
"Now cast your nets wherever you wish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never afeard are we!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So cried the stars to the fishermen three,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Wynken,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Blynken,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And Nod.</span><br />
<br />
All night long their nets they threw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the stars in the twinkling foam,&mdash;</span><br />
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bringing the fishermen home:</span><br />
'Twas all so pretty a sail, it seemed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if it could not be;</span><br />
And some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of sailing that beautiful sea;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I shall name you the fishermen three:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Wynken,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Blynken,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And Nod.</span><br />
<br />
Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Nod is a little head,</span><br />
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is a wee one's trundle-bed;</span><br />
So shut your eyes while Mother sings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of wonderful sights that be,</span><br />
And you shall see the beautiful things<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you rock in the misty sea</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Wynken,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Blynken,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">And Nod.</span><br />

<h4><br />THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE</h4>

<div class='poem'>
Have you ever heard of the Sugar-Plum Tree?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis a marvel of great renown!</span><br />
It blooms on the shore of the Lollypop sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the garden of Shut-Eye Town;</span><br />

That good little children have only to eat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of that fruit to be happy next day.</span><br />
<br />
When you've got to the tree, you would have a hard time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To capture the fruit which I sing;</span><br />
The tree is so tall that no person could climb<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the boughs where the sugar-plums swing!</span><br />
But up in that tree sits a chocolate cat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a gingerbread dog prowls below&mdash;</span><br />
And this is the way you contrive to get at<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those sugar-plums tempting you so:</span><br />
<br />
You say but the word to that gingerbread dog<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he barks with such terrible zest</span><br />
That the chocolate cat is at once all agog,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As her swelling proportions attest.</span><br />
And the chocolate cat goes cavorting around<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">From this leafy limb unto that,</span><br />
And the sugar-plums tumble, of course, to the ground&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hurrah for that chocolate cat!</span><br />
<br />
There are marshmallows, gumdrops, and peppermint canes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With stripings of scarlet or gold,</span><br />
And you carry away of the treasure that rains,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As much as your apron can hold!</span><br />
So come, little child, cuddle closer to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In your dainty white nightcap and gown,</span><br />
And I'll rock you away to that Sugar-Plum Tree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the garden of Shut-Eye Town.</span><br />

<h4><br />THE DUEL</h4>

<div class='center'>EUGENE FIELD<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
The gingham dog and the calico cat<br />
Side by side on the table sat;<br />
'Twas half past twelve, and (what do you think!)<br />
Nor one nor t'other had slept a wink!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Appeared to know as sure as fate</span><br />
There was going to be a terrible spat.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>I wasn't there; I simply state</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>What was told to me by the Chinese plate!</i>)</span><br />
<br />
The gingham dog went "Bow-wow-wow!"<br />
And the calico cat replied "Mee-ow!"<br />
The air was littered, an hour or so,<br />
With bits of gingham and calico,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the old Dutch clock in the chimney place</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up with its hands before its face,</span><br />
For it always dreaded a family row!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>Now mind: I'm only telling you</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>What the old Dutch clock declares is true!</i>)</span><br />
<br />
The Chinese plate looked very blue,<br />
And wailed, "Oh, dear! what shall we do!"<br />
But the gingham dog and the calico cat<br />
Wallowed this way and tumbled that,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Employing every tooth and claw</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the awfullest way you ever saw&mdash;</span><br />
And, oh! how the gingham and calico flew!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>Don't fancy I exaggerate&mdash;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>I got my news from the Chinese plate!</i>)</span><br />
<br />
Next morning, where the two had sat<br />
They found no trace of dog or cat:<br />
And some folks think unto this day<br />
That burglars stole that pair away!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the truth about the cat and pup</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is this: they ate each other up!</span><br />
Now what do you really think of that!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>The old Dutch clock it told me so,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And that is how I came to know.</i>)</span><br />

<div class="hang1">James Whitcomb Riley was born in Greenfield,
Indiana, in 1849, and died at Indianapolis
in 1916. His success was largely
due to his ability to present homely
phases of life in the Hoosier dialect. "The
Raggedy Man" is a good illustration of this
skill. In his prime Mr. Riley was an
excellent oral interpreter of his own work,
and his personifications of the Hoosier
types in his poems in recitals all over the
country had much to do with giving him
an understanding body of readers. He
had much of the power in which Stevenson
was so supreme&mdash;that power of remembering
accurately and giving full expression to
the points of view of childhood. The
perennial fascination of the circus as in
"The Circus Day Parade" illustrates this
particularly well. "The Treasures of the
Wise Man" represents another class of
Mr. Riley's poems in which he moralizes
in a fashion that makes people willing to be
preached at. It may be said very truly
that most of his poems have their chief
attraction in enabling older readers to
recall the almost vanished thrilling delights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
of youth, but poems that do that are
generally found to interest children also.</div>

O the night was dark and the night was late,<br />

They picked the locks of his palace gate,<br />
Seized his jewels and gems of state,<br />
His coffers of gold and his priceless plate&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The robbers that came to rob him.</span><br />
<br />
But loud laughed he in the morning red!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For of what had the robbers robbed him?&mdash;</span><br />
Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the robbers came to rob him,&mdash;</span><br />
They robbed him not of a golden shred<br />
Of the childish dreams in his wise old head&mdash;<br />
"And they're welcome to all things else," he said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the robbers came to rob him.</span><br />

Oh, the Circus-Day parade! How the bugles played and played!<br />
And how the glossy horses tossed their flossy manes, and neighed,<br />

How the grand band-wagon shone with a splendor all its own,<br />
And glittered with a glory that our dreams had never known!<br />
And how the boys behind, high and low of every kind,<br />
Marched in unconscious capture, with a rapture undefined!<br />
<br />
How the horsemen, two and two, with their plumes of white and blue,<br />
And crimson, gold and purple, nodding by at me and you,<br />
Waved the banners that they bore, as the Knights in days of yore,<br />
Till our glad eyes gleamed and glistened like the spangles that they wore!<br />
<br />
How the graceless-graceful stride of the elephant was eyed,<br />
And the capers of the little horse that cantered at his side!<br />
How the shambling camels, tame to the plaudits of their fame,<br />
With listless eyes came silent, masticating as they came.<br />
<br />
How the cages jolted past, with each wagon battened fast,<br />
And the mystery within it only hinted of at last<br />
From the little grated square in the rear, and nosing there<br />
The snout of some strange animal that sniffed the outer air!<br />
<br />
And, last of all, The Clown, making mirth for all the town,<br />
With his lips curved ever upward and his eyebrows ever down,<br />
And his chief attention paid to the little mule that played<br />

<div class="hang1">James Hogg (1770-1835) was a poet of Scotland
and a contemporary of Sir Walter
Scott. He was known as the Ettrick
Shepherd, from the place of his birth and
from the fact that as a boy he tended the
sheep. He had little schooling and was a
thoroughly self-made man. The strongly
marked and energetic swing of the rhythm,
fitting in so well with the vigorous out-of-door
experiences suggested, has made "A
Boy's Song" a great favorite. Other poems
of his that are still read are "The Skylark"
and the verse fairy tale called "Kilmeny."</div>

<div class='center'>MARY HOWITT<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
"Will you walk into my parlor?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the Spider to the Fly;</span><br />
"'Tis the prettiest little parlor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That ever you did spy.</span><br />
<br />
"The way into my parlor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is up a winding stair,</span><br />
And I have many curious things<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To show when you are there."</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, no, no," said the little Fly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To ask me is in vain;</span><br />
For who goes up your winding stair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can ne'er come down again."</span><br />
<br />
"I'm sure you must be weary, dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With soaring up so high;</span><br />
Will you rest upon my little bed?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the Spider to the Fly.</span><br />
<br />
"There are pretty curtains drawn around;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sheets are fine and thin,</span><br />
And if you like to rest awhile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll snugly tuck you in!"</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, no, no," said the little Fly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For I've often heard it said,</span><br />
They never, never wake again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who sleep upon your bed."</span><br />
<br />
Said the cunning Spider to the Fly:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Dear friend, what can I do</span><br />
To prove the warm affection<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've always felt for you?</span><br />
<br />
"I have within my pantry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Good store of all that's nice:</span><br />
I'm sure you're very welcome&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will you please to take a slice?"</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, no, no," said the little Fly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Kind sir, that cannot be;</span><br />
I've heard what's in your pantry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I do not wish to see."</span><br />
<br />
"Sweet creature!" said the Spider,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You're witty and you're wise;</span><br />
How handsome are your gauzy wings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How brilliant are your eyes!</span><br />
<br />
"I have a little looking-glass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon my parlor shelf;</span><br />
If you'll step in one moment, dear,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">You shall behold yourself."</span><br />
<br />
"I thank you, gentle sir," she said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For what you're pleased to say,</span><br />
And, bidding you good-morning now,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll call another day."</span><br />
<br />
The Spider turned him round about.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And went into his den,</span><br />
For well he knew the silly Fly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would soon come back again:</span><br />
<br />
So he wove a subtle web<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a little corner sly,</span><br />
And set his table ready<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To dine upon the Fly.</span><br />
<br />
Then came out to his door again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And merrily did sing:</span><br />
"Come hither, hither, pretty Fly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the pearl and silver wing;</span><br />
<br />
"Your robes are green and purple&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's a crest upon your head;</span><br />
Your eyes are like the diamond bright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But mine are dull as lead!"</span><br />
<br />
Alas, alas! how very soon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This silly little Fly,</span><br />
Hearing his wily, flattering words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came slowly flitting by;</span><br />
<br />
With buzzing wings she hung aloft,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then near and nearer drew,</span><br />
Thinking only of her brilliant eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And green and purple hue&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Thinking only of her crested head&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor, foolish thing! At last,</span><br />
Up jumped the cunning Spider,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fiercely held her fast.</span><br />
<br />
He dragged her up his winding stair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into his dismal den,</span><br />
Within his little parlor&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she ne'er came out again.</span><br />
<br />
And now, dear little children,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who may this story read,</span><br />
To idle, silly, flattering words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I pray you ne'er give heed.</span><br />
<br />
Unto an evil counsellor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Close heart and ear and eye,</span><br />
And take a lesson from this tale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the Spider and the Fly.</span><br />

<div class="hang1">William Howitt (1792-1879) and his wife,
author of the preceding poem, worked
together on many literary projects. One of
William Howitt's poems, "The Wind in a
Frolic," has long found a place in collections
for children. It presents the wind in a
sprightly, mischievous, and boisterous mood.</div>


<h4><br />THE WIND IN A FROLIC</h4>

<div class='center'>WILLIAM HOWITT<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem2'>
The wind one morning sprang up from sleep,<br />
Saying, "Now for a frolic! now for a leap!<br />
Now for a madcap galloping chase!<br />
I'll make a commotion in every place!"<br />
<br />
So it swept with a bustle right through a great town,<br />
Cracking the signs and scattering down<br />
Shutters; and whisking, with merciless squalls,<br />
Old women's bonnets and gingerbread stalls,<br />
There never was heard a much lustier shout,<br />
As the apples and oranges trundled about;<br />
And the urchins that stand with their thievish eyes<br />
For ever on watch, ran off each with a prize.<br />
<br />
Then away to the field it went, blustering and humming,<br />
And the cattle all wondered whatever was coming;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>It plucked by the tails the grave matronly cows,<br />
And tossed the colts' manes all over their brows;<br />
Till, offended at such an unusual salute,<br />
They all turned their backs, and stood sulky and mute.<br />
<br />
So on it went capering and playing its pranks,<br />
Whistling with reeds on the broad river's banks,<br />
Puffing the birds as they sat on the spray,<br />
Or the traveller grave on the king's highway.<br />
It was not too nice to hustle the bags<br />
Of the beggar, and flutter his dirty rags;<br />
<br />
'Twas so bold that it feared not to play its joke<br />
With the doctor's wig or the gentleman's cloak.<br />
Through the forest it roared, and cried gaily, "Now,<br />
You sturdy old oaks, I'll make you bow!"<br />
And it made them bow without more ado,<br />
Or it cracked their great branches through and through.<br />
<br />
Then it rushed like a monster on cottage and farm,<br />
Striking their dwellers with sudden alarm;<br />
And they ran out like bees in a midsummer swarm;&mdash;<br />
<br />
There were dames with their kerchiefs tied over their caps,<br />
To see if their poultry were free from mishaps;<br />
The turkeys they gobbled, the geese screamed aloud,<br />
And the hens crept to roost in a terrified crowd;<br />
There was rearing of ladders, and logs laying on,<br />
Where the thatch from the roof threatened soon to be gone.<br />
<br />
But the wind had swept on, and had met in a lane<br />
With a schoolboy, who panted and struggled in vain;<br />
For it tossed him and twirled him, then passed, and he stood<br />
With his hat in a pool and his shoes in the mud.<br />
<br />
Then away went the wind in its holiday glee,<br />
And now it was far on the billowy sea,<br />
And the lordly ships felt its staggering blow,<br />
And the little boats darted to and fro.<br />
<br />
But lo! it was night, and it sank to rest<br />
On the sea-bird's rock in the gleaming West,<br />
Laughing to think, in its fearful fun,<br />
How little of mischief it really had done.<br /><br /><br /><br />

<div class="hang1">Ann Taylor (1782-1866) and Jane Taylor
(1783-1824), English writers of verse and
prose for children, have earned a permanent
place in the history of juvenile literature on
account of the real worth of their work and
because they were among the first authors to
write poetry especially for children. They
published jointly three volumes of verse for
children: <i>Original Poems for Infant Minds</i>,
<i>Rhymes for the Nursery</i>, and <i>Hymns for
Infant Minds</i>. Many of their poems seem
a little too didactic, but they were genuine
in their ethical earnestness and largely
succeeded in putting things in terms of
the child's own comprehension. The four
poems given here represent them at their
best, which was good enough to win the
admiration of Sir Walter Scott.</div>

<h4><br />MEDDLESOME MATTY</h4>

One ugly trick has often spoiled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sweetest and the best;</span><br />
Matilda, though a pleasant child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One ugly trick possessed,</span><br />
Which, like a cloud before the skies,<br />
Hid all her better qualities.<br />
<br />
Sometimes she'd lift the tea-pot lid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To peep at what was in it;</span><br />
Or tilt the kettle, if you did<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But turn your back a minute.</span><br />

Her trick of meddling grew so much.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by mistake she laid</span><br />
Her spectacles and snuff-box gay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too near the little maid;</span><br />
"Ah! well," thought she, "I'll try them on,<br />
As soon as grandmamma is gone."<br />
<br />
Forthwith she placed upon her nose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The glasses large and wide;</span><br />
And looking round, as I suppose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The snuff-box too she spied:</span><br />
"Oh! what a pretty box is that;<br />
I'll open it," said little Matt.<br />
<br />
"I know that grandmamma would say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Don't meddle with it, dear,'</span><br />
But then, she's far enough away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no one else is near:</span><br />
Besides, what can there be amiss<br />
In opening such a box as this?"<br />
<br />
So thumb and finger went to work<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To move the stubborn lid,</span><br />
And presently a mighty jerk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mighty mischief did;</span><br />
For all at once, ah! woeful case,<br />
The snuff came puffing in her face.<br />
<br />
Poor eyes, and nose, and mouth beside<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dismal sight presented;</span><br />
In vain, as bitterly she cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her folly she repented.</span><br />
In vain she ran about for ease;<br />
She could do nothing else but sneeze.<br />
<br />
She dashed the spectacles away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wipe her tingling eyes,</span><br />
And as in twenty bits they lay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her grandmamma she spies.</span><br />
"Heyday! and what's the matter now?"<br />
Says grandmamma with lifted brow.<br />
<br />
Matilda, smarting with the pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tingling still, and sore,</span><br />
Made many a promise to refrain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From meddling evermore.</span><br />
And 'tis a fact, as I have heard,<br />
She ever since has kept her word.<br />

I like little Pussy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her coat is so warm;</span><br />
And if I don't hurt her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She'll do me no harm.</span><br />

And she'll love me because<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am gentle and good.</span><br />
<br />
I'll pat little Pussy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then she will purr,</span><br />
And thus show her thanks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For my kindness to her;</span><br />
I'll not pinch her ears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor tread on her paw,</span><br />
Lest I should provoke her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To use her sharp claw;</span><br />
I never will vex her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor make her displeased,</span><br />
For Pussy can't bear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be worried or teased.</span><br />

<h4><br />THE STAR</h4>

<div class='center'>JANE TAYLOR<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br />
How I wonder what you are.<br />
Up above the world so high,<br />
Like a diamond in the sky.<br />
<br />
When the blazing sun is gone,<br />
When he nothing shines upon,<br />
Then you show your little light,<br />
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.<br />
<br />
Then the traveler in the dark<br />
Thanks you for your tiny spark;<br />
He could not see which way to go,<br />
If you did not twinkle so.<br />
<br />
In the dark blue sky you keep,<br />
And often through my curtains peep,<br />
For you never shut your eye<br />
Till the sun is in the sky.<br />
<br />
As your bright and tiny spark<br />
Lights the traveler in the dark,<br />
Though I know not what you are,<br />
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.<br /><br /><br />

<div class="hang1">Although Christina G. Rossetti (1830-1894)
is not known primarily as a writer for
children, her <i>Sing-Song</i>, from which the
next seven poems are taken, is a juvenile
classic. She ranks very high among the
women poets of the nineteenth century,
her only equal being Mrs. Browning.
Besides the brief poems in <i>Sing-Song</i>, Miss
Rossetti's "Goblin Market" and "Uphill"
please young people of a contemplative
mood. While there is an undercurrent of
sadness in much of her work, it is a natural
accompaniment of her themes and is not
unduly emphasized.</div>

<h4><br />GOOD-NIGHT AND GOOD-MORNING</h4>

<div class='center'>RICHARD MONCKTON MILNES<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
A fair little girl sat under a tree,<br />
Sewing as long as her eyes could see;<br />
Then smoothed her work and folded it right<br />
And said, "Dear work, good-night, good-night!"<br />
<br />
Such a number of rooks came over her head,<br />
Crying "Caw! Caw!" on their way to bed,<br />
She said, as she watched their curious flight,<br />
"Little black things, good-night, good-night!"<br />
<br />
The horses neighed, and the oxen lowed,<br />
The sheep's "Bleat! Bleat!" came over the road;<br />
All seeming to say, with a quiet delight,<br />
"Good little girl, good-night, good-night!"<br />
<br />
She did not say to the sun, "Good-night!"<br />
Though she saw him there like a ball of light;<br />
For she knew he had God's time to keep<br />
All over the world and never could sleep.<br />
<br />
The tall pink foxglove bowed his head;<br />
The violets curtsied, and went to bed;<br />
And good little Lucy tied up her hair,<br />
And said, on her knees, her favorite prayer.<br />
<br />
And while on her pillow she softly lay,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>She knew nothing more till again it was day;<br />
And all things said to the beautiful sun,<br />

<div class="hang1">It is quite impossible for us to realize why the
English reading public should have been
so excited over the following poem in the
years immediately following its first appearance
in 1806. It attracted the attention of
royalty, was set to music, had a host of
imitators, and established itself as a nursery
classic. It was written by William
Roscoe (1753-1831), historian, banker,
and poet, for his son Robert, and was
merely an entertaining skit upon an actual
banquet. Probably the fact that the
characters at the butterfly's ball were
drawn with human faces in the original
illustrations to represent the prominent
guests at the actual banquet had much to
do with the initial success. The impulse
which it received a hundred years ago,
coupled with its own undoubted power of
fancy, has projected it thus far, and children
seem inclined to approve and still
further insure its already long life.</div>


<h4><br />THE BUTTERFLY'S BALL</h4>

<div class='center'>WILLIAM ROSCOE<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
"Come, take up your hats, and away let us haste<br />
To the Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast,<br />
The Trumpeter, Gadfly, has summon'd the crew,<br />
And the Revels are now only waiting for you."<br />
So said little Robert, and pacing along,<br />
His merry Companions came forth in a throng,<br />
And on the smooth Grass by the side of a Wood,<br />
Beneath a broad oak that for ages had stood,<br />
Saw the Children of Earth and the Tenants of Air<br />
For an Evening's Amusement together repair.<br />
<br />
And there came the Beetle, so blind and so black,<br />
Who carried the Emmet, his friend, on his back,<br />
And there was the Gnat and the Dragonfly too,<br />
With all their Relations, green, orange and blue.<br />
And there came the Moth, with his plumage of down,<br />
And the Hornet in jacket of yellow and brown;<br />
Who with him the Wasp, his companion, did bring,<br />
But they promised that evening to lay by their sting.<br />
And the sly little Dormouse crept out of his hole,<br />
And brought to the Feast his blind Brother, the Mole;<br />
And the Snail, with his horns peeping out of his shell,<br />
Came from a great distance, the length of an ell.<br />
<br />
A Mushroom, their Table, and on it was laid<br />
A water-dock leaf, which a table-cloth made.<br />
The Viands were various, to each of their taste,<br />
And the Bee brought her honey to crown the Repast.<br />
Then close on his haunches, so solemn and wise,<br />
The Frog from a corner look'd up to the skies;<br />
And the Squirrel, well pleased such diversion to see,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>Mounted high overhead and look'd down from a tree.<br />
Then out came the Spider, with finger so fine,<br />
To show his dexterity on the tight-line,<br />
From one branch to another his cobwebs he slung,<br />
Then quick as an arrow he darted along,<br />
But just in the middle&mdash;oh! shocking to tell,<br />
From his rope, in an instant, poor Harlequin fell.<br />
Yet he touch'd not the ground, but with talons outspread,<br />
Hung suspended in air, at the end of a thread.<br />
<br />
Then the Grasshopper came with a jerk and a spring,<br />
Very long was his Leg, though but short was his Wing;<br />
He took but three leaps, and was soon out of sight,<br />
Then chirp'd his own praises the rest of the night.<br />
With step so majestic the Snail did advance,<br />
And promised the Gazers a Minuet to dance;<br />
But they all laughed so loud that he pulled in his head,<br />
And went in his own little chamber to bed.<br />
Then as Evening gave way to the shadows of Night,<br />
Their Watchman, the Glowworm, came out with a light.<br />
"Then Home let us hasten while yet we can see,<br />
For no Watchman is waiting for you and for me."<br />
So said little Robert, and pacing along,<br />
His merry Companions return'd in a throng.<br />

A traveler on a dusty road<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strewed acorns on the lea;</span><br />
And one took root and sprouted up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And grew into a tree.</span><br />
Love sought its shade at evening-time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To breathe its early vows;</span><br />
And Age was pleased, in heats of noon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To bask beneath its boughs.</span><br />
The dormouse loved its dangling twigs,<br />

A little spring had lost its way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amid the grass and fern;</span><br />
A passing stranger scooped a well<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where weary men might turn;</span><br />
He walled it in, and hung with care<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A ladle at the brink;</span><br />
He thought not of the deed he did,<br />

A dreamer dropped a random thought;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas old, and yet 'twas new;</span><br />
A simple fancy of the brain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But strong in being true.</span><br />
It shone upon a genial mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, lo! its light became</span><br />
A lamp of life, a beacon ray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A monitory flame.</span><br />
The thought was small; its issue great;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A watch-fire on the hill,</span><br />
It sheds its radiance far adown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cheers the valley still.</span><br />
<br />
A nameless man, amid the crowd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That thronged the daily mart,</span><br />
Let fall a word of hope and love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unstudied from the heart,&mdash;</span><br />
A whisper on the tumult thrown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A transitory breath,&mdash;</span><br />
It raised a brother from the dust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It saved a soul from death.</span><br />
O germ! O fount! O word of love!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O thought at random cast!</span><br />
Ye were but little at the first,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whence all but him had fled;</span><br />
The flame that lit the battle's wreck<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shone round him o'er the dead.</span><br />
<br />
Yet beautiful and bright he stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As born to rule the storm;</span><br />
A creature of heroic blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A proud, though child-like form.</span><br />
<br />
The flames rolled on; he would not go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without his father's word;</span><br />
That father, faint in death below,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His voice no longer heard.</span><br />
<br />
He called aloud, "Say, father, say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If yet my task be done!"</span><br />
He knew not that the chieftain lay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unconscious of his son.</span><br />
<br />
"Speak, father!" once again he cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"If I may yet be gone!"</span><br />
And but the booming shots replied,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fast the flames rolled on.</span><br />
<br />
Upon his brow he felt their breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in his waving hair,</span><br />
And looked from that lone post of death<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In still, yet brave despair.</span><br />
<br />
And shouted but once more aloud,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My father! must I stay?"</span><br />
While o'er him, fast, through sail and shroud,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wreathing fires made way.</span><br />
<br />
They wrapt the ship in splendor wild,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They caught the flag on high,</span><br />
And streamed above the gallant child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like banners in the sky.</span><br />
<br />
There came a burst of thunder sound:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The boy,&mdash;oh! where was he?</span><br />
Ask of the winds, that far around<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With fragments strewed the sea,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That well had borne their part,&mdash;</span><br />
But the noblest thing that perished there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was that young, faithful heart.</span><br /><br /><br />

<div class="hang1">The five numbers that follow are from the
works of the great English poet and mystic
William Blake (1757-1827). All except the
first are given in their entirety. No. <a href="#Note_328">328</a>
is made up of three couplets taken from the
loosely strung together <i>Auguries of Innocence</i>.
Nos. <a href="#Note_329">329</a>, <a href="#Note_330">330</a>, and <a href="#Note_332">332</a> are from
<i>Songs of Innocence</i> (1789), where the last
was printed as an introduction without any
other title. No. <a href="#Note_331">331</a> is from <i>Songs of Experience</i>
(1794). Blake labored in obscurity
and poverty, though he has now come to
be regarded as one of England's most
important poets. It is not necessary that
children should understand fully all that
Blake says, but it is important for teachers
to realize that most children are natural
mystics and that Blake's poetry, more than
any other, is the natural food for them.</div>

So I sung the same again,<br />
While he wept with joy to hear.<br />
<br />
"Piper, sit thee down and write<br />
In a book that all may read."<br />
So he vanish'd from my sight;<br />
And I pluck'd a hollow reed,<br />
<br />
And I made a rural pen,<br />
And I stain'd the water clear,<br />
And I wrote my happy songs<br />
Every child may joy to hear.<br />

<h3><br /><a name="Note_333" id="Note_333">333</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Eliza Cook (1818-1889) was an English poet
who had quite a vogue in her day, and
whose poem "Try Again" deals with one of
those incidents held in affectionate remembrance
by youth. Bruce and the spider
may be less historically true, but it seems
destined to eternal life alongside Leonidas
and his Spartans. Older readers may
remember Miss Cook's "My Old Arm
Chair," which is usually given the place
of honor as her most popular poem.</div>


<h4><br />TRY AGAIN</h4>

<div class='center'>ELIZA COOK<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
King Bruce of Scotland flung himself down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a lonely mood to think:</span><br />
'Tis true he was monarch, and wore a crown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But his heart was beginning to sink.</span><br />
<br />
For he had been trying to do a great deed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make his people glad;</span><br />
He had tried and tried, but couldn't succeed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so he became quite sad.</span><br />
<br />
He flung himself down in low despair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As grieved as man could be;</span><br />
And after a while as he pondered there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I'll give it all up," said he.</span><br />
<br />
Now, just at the moment, a spider dropped,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With its silken, filmy clue;</span><br />
And the King, in the midst of his thinking, stopped<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see what the spider would do.</span><br />
<br />
'Twas a long way up to the ceiling dome,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it hung by a rope so fine,</span><br />
That how it would get to its cobweb home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">King Bruce could not divine.</span><br />
<br />
It soon began to cling and crawl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Straight up, with strong endeavor;</span><br />
But down it came with a slippery sprawl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As near to the ground as ever.</span><br />
<br />
Up, up it ran, not a second to stay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To utter the least complaint,</span><br />
Till it fell still lower, and there it lay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little dizzy and faint.</span><br />
<br />
Its head grew steady&mdash;again it went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And traveled a half yard higher;</span><br />
'Twas a delicate thread it had to tread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a road where its feet would tire.</span><br />
<br />
Again it fell and swung below,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But again it quickly mounted;</span><br />
Till up and down, now fast, now slow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nine brave attempts were counted.</span><br />
<br />
"Sure," cried the King, "that foolish thing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will strive no more to climb;</span><br />
When it toils so hard to reach and cling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tumbles every time."</span><br />
<br />
But up the insect went once more;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah me! 'tis an anxious minute;</span><br />
He's only a foot from his cobweb door.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, say, will he lose or win it?</span><br />
<br />
Steadily, steadily, inch by inch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Higher and higher he got;</span><br />
And a bold little run at the very last pinch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Put him into his native cot.</span><br />
<br />
"Bravo, bravo!" the King cried out;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"All honor to those who <i>try;</i></span><br />
The spider up there, defied despair;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He conquered, and why shouldn't I?"</span><br />
<br />
And Bruce of Scotland braced his mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gossips tell the tale,</span><br />
That he tried once more as he tried before,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that time did not fail.</span><br />
<br />
Pay goodly heed, all ye who read,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And beware of saying, "I <i>can't</i>";</span><br />
'Tis a cowardly word, and apt to lead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To idleness, folly, and want.</span><br />
<br />
Whenever you find your heart despair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of doing some goodly thing,</span><br />
Con over this strain, try bravely again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And remember the spider and King!</span><br />

<div class="hang1">Nonsense verse seems to have its special
place in the economy of life as a sort of
balance to the over-serious tendency. One
of the two great masters of verse of this
sort was the English author Edward Lear
(1812-1888). He was also a famous illustrator
of books and magazines. Among
his juvenile books, illustrated by himself,
were <i>Nonsense Songs</i> and <i>More Nonsense
Songs</i>. All his verse is now generally
published under the first title. Good
nonsense verse precludes explanation, the
mind of the hearer being too busy with the
delightfully odd combinations to figure on
how they happened.</div>


<h4><br />THE OWL AND THE
PUSSY-CAT</h4>

<div class='center'>EDWARD LEAR<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a beautiful pea-green boat:</span><br />
They took some honey, and plenty of money<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wrapped up in a five-pound note.</span><br />
The Owl looked up to the stars above,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sang to a small guitar,</span><br />
"O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What a beautiful Pussy you are,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">You are,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">You are!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What a beautiful Pussy you are!"</span><br />
<br />
Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How charmingly sweet you sing!</span><br />
Oh! let us be married; too long we have tarried:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But what shall we do for a ring?"</span><br />
They sailed away, for a year and a day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the land where the bong-tree grows;</span><br />
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a ring at the end of his nose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His nose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His nose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a ring at the end of his nose.</span><br />
<br />
"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I will."</span><br />
So they took it away, and were married next day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the Turkey who lives on the hill.</span><br />
They dined on mince, and slices of quince,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which they ate with a runcible spoon;</span><br />
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They danced by the light of the moon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The moon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The moon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They danced by the light of the moon.</span><br /></div>

<h4><br />THE TABLE AND THE CHAIR</h4>

<div class='center'>EDWARD LEAR<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Said the Table to the Chair,<br />
"You can hardly be aware<br />
How I suffer from the heat<br />
And from chilblains on my feet.<br />
If we took a little walk,<br />
We might have a little talk;<br />
Pray let us take the air,"<br />
Said the Table to the Chair.<br />
<br />
Said the Chair unto the Table,<br />
"Now, you <i>know</i> we are not able:<br />
How foolishly you talk,<br />
When you know we <i>cannot</i> walk!"<br />
Said the Table with a sigh,<br />
"It can do no harm to try.<br />
I've as many legs as you:<br />
Why can't we walk on two?"<br />
<br />
So they both went slowly down,<br />
And walked about the town<br />
With a cheerful bumpy sound<br />
As they toddled round and round;<br />
And everybody cried,<br />
As they hastened to their side,<br />
"See! the Table and the Chair<br />
Have come out to take the air!"<br />
<br />
But in going down an alley,<br />
To a castle in a valley,<br />
They completely lost their way,<br />
And wandered all the day;<br />
Till, to see them safely back,<br />
They paid a Ducky-quack,<br />
And a Beetle, and a Mouse,<br />
Who took them to their house.<br />
<br />
Then they whispered to each other,<br />
"O delightful little brother,<br />
What a lovely walk we've taken!<br />
Let us dine on beans and bacon."<br />
So the Ducky and the leetle<br />
Browny-mousy and the Beetle<br />
Dined, and danced upon their heads<br />
Till they toddled to their beds.<br />

<h4><br />THE POBBLE WHO HAS
NO TOES</h4>

<div class='center'>EDWARD LEAR<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
The Pobble who has no toes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had once as many as we;</span><br />
When they said, "Some day you may lose them all";<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He replied&mdash;"Fish fiddle-de-dee!"</span><br />
And his Aunt Jobiska made him drink<br />
Lavender water tinged with pink,<br />
For she said, "The world in general knows<br />
There's nothing so good for a Pobble's toes!"<br />
<br />
The Pobble who has no toes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swam across the Bristol Channel;</span><br />
But before he set out he wrapped his nose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a piece of scarlet flannel.</span><br />
For his Aunt Jobiska said, "No harm<br />
Can come to his toes if his nose is warm;<br />
And it's perfectly known that a Pobble's toes<br />
Are safe&mdash;provided he minds his nose."<br />
<br />
The Pobble swam fast and well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when boats or ships came near him</span><br />
He tinkledy-binkledy-winkled a bell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So that all the world could hear him.</span><br />
And all the Sailors and Admirals cried,<br />
When they saw him nearing the farther side,&mdash;<br />
"He has gone to fish for his Aunt Jobiska's<br />
Runcible Cat with crimson whiskers!"<br />
<br />
But before he touched the shore,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The shore of the Bristol Channel,</span><br />
A sea-green Porpoise carried away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His wrapper of scarlet flannel.</span><br />
And when he came to observe his feet,<br />
Formerly garnished with toes so neat,<br />
His face at once became forlorn<br />
On perceiving that all his toes were gone!<br />
<br />
And nobody ever knew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From that dark day to the present,</span><br />
Whoso had taken the Pobble's toes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a manner so far from pleasant.</span><br />
Whether the shrimps or crawfish gray,<br />
Or crafty Mermaids stole them away&mdash;<br />
Nobody knew; and nobody knows<br />
How the Pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!<br />
<br />
The Pobble who has no toes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was placed in a friendly Bark,</span><br />
And they rowed him back, and carried him up<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To his Aunt Jobiska's Park.</span><br />
And she made him a feast at his earnest wish<br />
Of eggs and buttercups fried with fish;&mdash;<br />
And she said,&mdash;"It's a fact the whole world knows,<br />
That Pobbles are happier without their toes."<br />

<div class="hang1">The two great classics among modern nonsense
books are Lewis Carroll's <i>Alice in

They are in prose with poems interspersed.
"The Walrus and the Carpenter," is from

This latter book never achieved the success

<h4><br />THE WALRUS AND THE
CARPENTER</h4>

<div class='center'>"LEWIS CARROLL"<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
The sun was shining on the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shining with all his might:</span><br />
He did his very best to make<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The billows smooth and bright&mdash;</span><br />
And this was odd, because it was<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The middle of the night.</span><br />
<br />
The moon was shining sulkily,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because she thought the sun</span><br />
Had got no business to be there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">After the day was done&mdash;</span><br />
"It's very rude of him," she said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To come and spoil the fun!"</span><br />
<br />
The sea was wet as wet could be.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sands were dry as dry.</span><br />
You could not see a cloud, because<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No cloud was in the sky;</span><br />
No birds were flying overhead&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There were no birds to fly.</span><br />
<br />
The Walrus and the Carpenter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were walking close at hand;</span><br />
They wept like anything to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such quantities of sand:</span><br />
"If this were only cleared away,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They said, "it would be grand!"</span><br />
<br />
"If seven maids with seven mops<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swept it for half a year,</span><br />
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"That they could get it clear?"</span><br />
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shed a bitter tear.</span><br />
<br />
"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Walrus did beseech.</span><br />
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along the briny beach:</span><br />
We cannot do with more than four,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To give a hand to each."</span><br />
<br />
The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But never a word he said:</span><br />
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shook his heavy head&mdash;</span><br />
Meaning to say he did not choose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To leave the oyster-bed.</span><br />
<br />
But four young Oysters hurried up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All eager for the treat:</span><br />
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their shoes were clean and neat&mdash;</span><br />
And this was odd, because, you know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They hadn't any feet.</span><br />
<br />
Four other Oysters followed them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet another four;</span><br />
And thick and fast they came at last,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And more, and more, and more&mdash;</span><br />
All hopping through the frothy waves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scrambling to the shore.</span><br />
<br />
The Walrus and the Carpenter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walked on a mile or so,</span><br />
And then they rested on a rock<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conveniently low:</span><br />
And all the little Oysters stood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And waited in a row.</span><br />
<br />
"The time has come," the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To talk of many things:</span><br />
Of shoes&mdash;and ships&mdash;and sealing wax<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of cabbages&mdash;and kings&mdash;</span><br />
And why the sea is boiling hot&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And whether pigs have wings."</span><br />
<br />
"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Before we have our chat;</span><br />
For some of us are out of breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all of us are fat!"</span><br />
"No hurry!" said the Carpenter.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They thanked him much for that.</span><br />
<br />
"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Is what we chiefly need:</span><br />
Pepper and vinegar besides<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are very good indeed&mdash;</span><br />
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We can begin to feed."</span><br />
<br />
"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turning a little blue.</span><br />
"After such kindness, that would be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dismal thing to do!"</span><br />
"The night is fine," the Walrus said.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Do you admire the view?</span><br />
<br />
"It was so kind of you to come!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And you are very nice!"</span><br />
The Carpenter said nothing but<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Cut me another slice:</span><br />
I wish you were not quite so deaf&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've had to ask you twice!"</span><br />
<br />
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"To play them such a trick,</span><br />
After we've brought them out so far,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made them trot so quick!"</span><br />
The Carpenter said nothing but<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The butter's spread too thick!"</span><br />
<br />
"I weep for you," the Walrus said:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I deeply sympathize."</span><br />
With sobs and tears he sorted out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those of the largest size,</span><br />
Holding his pocket handkerchief<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before his streaming eyes.</span><br />
<br />
"O Oysters," cried the Carpenter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"You've had a pleasant run!</span><br />
Shall we be trotting home again?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But answer came there none&mdash;</span><br />
And this was scarcely odd, because<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They'd eaten every one.</span><br />

<div class="hang1">Isaac Watts (1674-1748) was an English
minister and the writer of many hymns
still included in our hymn books. He had
a notion that verse might be used as a
means of religious and ethical instruction
for children, and wrote some poems as
illustrations of his theory so that they
might suggest to better poets how to carry
out the idea. But Watts did this work
so well that two or three of his poems and
several of his stanzas have become common
possessions. They are dominated, of course,
by the heavy didactic moralizing, but are
all so genuine and true that young readers
feel their force and enjoy them.</div>

<div class='poem'>
O 'tis a lovely thing for youth<br />
To walk betimes in wisdom's way;<br />
To fear a lie, to speak the truth,<br />
That we may trust to all they say.<br />
<br />
But liars we can never trust,<br />
Though they should speak the thing that's true;<br />
And he that does one fault at first,<br />
And lies to hide it, makes it two.<br />

Appear in gayer coats than I;<br />
Let me be dressed fine as I will,<br />
Flies, worms, and flowers exceed me still.<br />

<div class="hang1">Most of the work of Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow (1807-1882) is within the range
of children's interests and comprehension.
Three poems are given here, "The Skeleton
in Armor," as representative of Longfellow's
large group of narrative poems, "The Day
Is Done," as an expression of the value of
poetry in everyday life, and "The Psalm
of Life," as the finest and most popular
example of his hortatory poems.</div>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_341" id="Note_341">341</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">"The Skeleton in Armor" is one of Longfellow's
first and best American art ballads.
In Newport, Rhode Island, is an old stone
tower known as the "Round Tower,"
which some people think was built by the
Northmen, though it probably was not.
In 1836 workmen unearthed a strange skeleton
at Fall River, Massachusetts. It was
wrapped in bark and coarse cloth. On
the breast was a plate of brass, and around
the waist was a belt of brass tubes. Apparently
it was not the skeleton of an Indian,
and people supposed it might have been that
of one of the old Norsemen. Longfellow
used these two historic facts as a basis for
the plot of his poem, which he wrote in 1840.</div>


<h4><br />THE SKELETON IN ARMOR</h4>

<div class='center'>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
"Speak! speak! thou fearful guest!<br />
Who, with thy hollow breast<br />
Still in rude armor drest,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comest to daunt me!</span><br />
Wrapt not in Eastern balms,<br />
But with thy fleshless palms<br />
Stretched, as if asking alms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Why dost thou haunt me?"</span><br />
<br />
Then, from those cavernous eyes<br />
Pale flashes seemed to rise,<br />
As when the Northern skies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gleam in December;</span><br />
And, like the water's flow<br />
Under December's snow,<br />
Came a dull voice of woe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From the heart's chamber.</span><br />
<br />
"I was a Viking old!<br />
My deeds, though manifold,<br />
No Skald in song has told,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No Saga taught thee!</span><br />
Take heed, that in thy verse<br />
Thou dost the tale rehearse,<br />
Else dread a dead man's curse!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For this I sought thee.</span><br />
<br />
"Far in the Northern Land,<br />
By the wild Baltic's strand,<br />
I, with my childish hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tamed the ger-falcon;</span><br />
And, with my skates fast-bound.<br />
Skimmed the half-frozen Sound,<br />
That the poor whimpering hound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Trembled to walk on.</span><br />
<br />
"Oft to his frozen lair<br />
Tracked I the grisly bear,<br />
While from my path the hare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fled like a shadow;</span><br />
Oft through the forest dark<br />
Followed the were-wolf's bark,<br />
Until the soaring lark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sang from the meadow.</span><br />
<br />
"But when I older grew,<br />
Joining a corsair's crew,<br />
O'er the dark sea I flew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With the marauders.</span><br />
Wild was the life we led;<br />
Many the souls that sped,<br />
Many the hearts that bled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By our stern orders.</span><br />
<br />
"Many a wassail-bout<br />
Wore the long Winter out;<br />
Often our midnight shout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Set the cocks crowing,</span><br />
As we the Berserk's tale<br />
Measured in cups of ale,<br />
Draining the oaken pail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Filled to o'erflowing.</span><br />
<br />
"Once, as I told in glee<br />
Tales of the stormy sea,<br />
Soft eyes did gaze on me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Burning, yet tender;</span><br />
And as the white stars shine<br />
On the dark Norway pine,<br />
On that dark heart of mine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fell their soft splendor.</span><br />
<br />
"I wooed the blue-eyed maid,<br />
Yielding, yet half afraid,<br />
And in the forest's shade<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our vows were plighted.</span><br />
Under its loosened vest<br />
Fluttered her little breast,<br />
Like birds within their nest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By the hawk frighted.</span><br />
<br />
"Bright in her father's hall<br />
Shields gleamed upon the wall,<br />
Loud sang the minstrels all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Chanting his glory:</span><br />
When of old Hildebrand<br />
I asked his daughter's hand,<br />
Mute did the minstrel stand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To hear my story.</span><br />
<br />
"While the brown ale he quaffed,<br />
Loud then the champion laughed,<br />
And as the wind-gusts waft<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sea-foam brightly,</span><br />
So the loud laugh of scorn,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>Out of those lips unshorn,<br />
From the deep drinking-horn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Blew the foam lightly.</span><br />
<br />
"She was a Prince's child,<br />
I but a Viking wild,<br />
And though she blushed and smiled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I was discarded!</span><br />
Should not the dove so white<br />
Follow the sea-new's flight,<br />
Why did they leave that night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her nest unguarded?</span><br />
<br />
"Scarce had I put to sea,<br />
Bearing the maid with me,&mdash;<br />
Fairest of all was she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Among the Norsemen!&mdash;</span><br />
When on the white-sea strand,<br />
Waving his arm&egrave;d hand,<br />
Saw we old Hildebrand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With twenty horsemen.</span><br />
<br />
"Then launched they to the blast,<br />
Bent like a reed each mast,<br />
Yet we were gaining fast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When the wind failed us;</span><br />
And with a sudden flaw<br />
Came round the gusty Skaw,<br />
So that our foe we saw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Laugh as he hailed us.</span><br />
<br />
"And as to catch the gale<br />
Round veered the flapping sail,<br />
'Death!' was the helmsman's hail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Death without quarter!</span><br />
Mid-ships with iron-keel<br />
Struck we her ribs of steel;<br />
Down her black hulk did reel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through the black water.</span><br />
<br />
"As with his wings aslant,<br />
Sails the fierce cormorant,<br />
Seeking some rocky haunt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With his prey laden;</span><br />
So toward the open main,<br />
Beating the sea again,<br />
Through the wild hurricane,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bore I the maiden.</span><br />
<br />
"Three weeks we westward bore,<br />
And when the storm was o'er,<br />
Cloud-like we saw the shore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stretching to leeward;</span><br />
There for my lady's bower<br />
Built I the lofty tower,<br />
Which, to this very hour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stands looking seaward.</span><br />
<br />
"There lived we many years;<br />
Time dried the maiden's tears;<br />
She had forgot her fears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She was a mother;</span><br />
Death closed her mild blue eyes,<br />
Under that tower she lies;<br />
Ne'er shall the sun arise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On such another!</span><br />
<br />
"Still grew my bosom then,<br />
Still as a stagnant fen!<br />
Hateful to me were men,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sunlight hateful!</span><br />
In the vast forest here,<br />
Clad in my warlike gear,<br />
Fell I upon my spear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh, death was grateful!</span><br />
<br />
"Thus, seamed with many scars,<br />
Bursting these prison bars,<br />
Up to its native stars<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My soul ascended!</span><br />
There from the flowing bowl<br />
Deep drinks the warrior's soul,<br />
<i>Skoal!</i> to the Northland! <i>Skoal!</i>"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;Thus the tale ended.</span><br />

The day is done, and the darkness<br />

As a feather is wafted downward<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From an eagle in its flight.</span><br />
<br />
I see the lights of the village<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gleam through the rain and the mist,</span><br />
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That my soul cannot resist:</span><br />
<br />
A feeling of sadness and longing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That is not akin to pain,</span><br />
And resembles sorrow only<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the mist resembles the rain.</span><br />
<br />
Come, read to me some poem,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some simple and heartfelt lay,</span><br />
That shall soothe this restless feeling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And banish the thoughts of day.</span><br />
<br />
Not from the grand old masters,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not from the bards sublime,</span><br />
Whose distant footsteps echo<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the corridors of Time.</span><br />
<br />
For, like strains of martial music,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their mighty thoughts suggest</span><br />
Life's endless toil and endeavor;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to-night I long for rest.</span><br />
<br />
Read from some humbler poet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose songs gushed from his heart,</span><br />
As showers from the clouds of summer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or tears from the eyelids start;</span><br />
<br />
Who, through long days of labor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nights devoid of ease,</span><br />
Still heard in his soul the music<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of wonderful melodies.</span><br />
<br />
Such songs have power to quiet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The restless pulse of care,</span><br />
And come like the benediction<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That follows after prayer.</span><br />
<br />
Then read from the treasured volume<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The poem of thy choice,</span><br />
And lend to the rhyme of the poet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The beauty of thy voice.</span><br />
<br />
And the night shall be filled with music,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the cares that infest the day,</span><br />
Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as silently steal away.</span><br />

Tell me not, in mournful numbers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Life is but an empty dream!&mdash;</span><br />

<br />
Life is real! Life is earnest!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the grave is not its goal;</span><br />

Art is long, and Time is fleeting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our hearts, though stout and brave,</span><br />
Still, like muffled drums, are beating<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Funeral marches to the grave.</span><br />

Be not like dumb, driven cattle!<br />

Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!<br />

Act,&mdash;act in the living Present!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heart within, and God o'erhead!</span><br />

Lives of great men all remind us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We can make our lives sublime,</span><br />

Let us, then, be up and doing,<br />

juvenile literature. His <i>Water Babies</i> is
popular with children of the fourth and
fifth grade, while his book of Greek myths
entitled <i>The Heroes</i> is a classic for older
children. The next two poems are popular
with both adults and children. Kingsley
was a minister and his church was located
in Devon so that the tragedies of the sea
among the fisher folk were often brought
to his attention. Both these poems deal
with such tragedies.</div>


<h4><br />THE THREE FISHERS</h4>

<div class='center'>CHARLES KINGSLEY<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Three fishers went sailing out into the west,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out into the west as the sun went down;</span><br />
Each thought of the woman who loved him the best,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the children stood watching them out of the town;</span><br />
For men must work, and women must weep;<br />
And there's little to earn, and many to keep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though the harbor bar be moaning.</span><br />
<br />
Three wives sat up in the light-house tower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And trimmed the lamps as the sun went down;</span><br />
And they looked at the squall, and they looked at the shower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the rack it came rolling up, ragged and brown;</span><br />
But men must work, and women must weep,<br />
Though storms be sudden, and waters deep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the harbor bar be moaning.</span><br />
<br />
Three corpses lay out on the shining sands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the morning gleam as the tide went down,</span><br />
And the women are watching and wringing their hands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For those who will never come back to the town;</span><br />
For men must work, and women must weep,&mdash;<br />
And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And good-by to the bar and its moaning.</span><br />

<h4><br />THE SANDS OF DEE</h4>

<div class='center'>CHARLES KINGSLEY<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
"O Mary, go and call the cattle home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And call the cattle home,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And call the cattle home</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Across the sands of Dee!"</span><br />
The western wind was wild and dank with foam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And all alone went she.</span><br />
<br />
The western tide crept up along the sand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And o'er and o'er the sand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And round and round the sand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As far as eye could see.</span><br />
The rolling mist came down and hid the land:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And never home came she.</span><br />
<br />
"Oh! is it weed, or fish, or floating hair&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A tress of golden hair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A drown&egrave;d maiden's hair</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Above the nets at sea?</span><br />
Was never salmon yet that shone so fair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Among the stakes on Dee."</span><br />
<br />
They rowed her in across the sailing foam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The cruel crawling foam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The cruel hungry foam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To her grave beside the sea:</span><br />
But still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Across the sands of Dee!</span><br /><br /><br />

<div class='poem'>
The rain had fallen, the Poet arose,<br />

A light wind blew from the gates of the sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And waves of shadow went over the wheat,</span><br />
And he sat him down in a lonely place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And chanted a melody loud and sweet,</span><br />
That made the wild-swan pause in her cloud,<br />

The swallow stopt as he hunted the bee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The snake slipt under a spray,</span><br />
The wild hawk stood with the down on his beak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And stared, with his foot on the prey,</span><br />
And the nightingale thought, "I have sung many songs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But never a one so gay,</span><br />
For he sings of what the world will be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the years have died away."</span><br />

<div class="hang1">Those who live near the sea know that outside
a harbor a bar is formed of earth
washed down from the land. At low tide
this may be so near the surface as to be
dangerous to ships passing in and out, and
the waves may beat against it with a moaning
sound. In his eighty-first year Tennyson
wrote "Crossing the Bar" to express
his thought about death. He represents
the soul as having come from the boundless
deep of eternity into this world-harbor of
Time and Place, and he represents death
as the departure from the harbor. He
would have no lingering illness to bar the
departure. He would have the end of
life's day to be peaceful and without sadness
of farewell, for he trusts that his
journey into the sea of eternity will be
guided by "my Pilot." This poem may
be somewhat beyond the comprehension of
eighth-grade pupils, but they can perceive
the beauty of the imagery and music, and
later in life it will be a source of hope and
comfort.</div>


<h4><br />CROSSING THE BAR</h4>

<div class='center'>ALFRED TENNYSON<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Sunset and evening star,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And one clear call for me!</span><br />
And may there be no moaning of the bar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I put out to sea,</span><br />
<br />
But such a tide as moving seems asleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too full for sound and foam,</span><br />
When that which drew from out the boundless deep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turns again home.</span><br />
<br />
Twilight and evening bell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And after that the dark!</span><br />
And may there be no sadness of farewell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I embark;</span><br />
<br />
For though from out our bourne of Time and Place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The flood may bear me far,</span><br />
I hope to see my Pilot face to face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I have crossed the bar.</span><br />

<div class="hang1">Leigh Hunt (1784-1859) was an English
essayist, journalist, and poet. His one
universally known poem is "Abou Ben
Adhem." The secret of its appeal is no
doubt the emphasis placed on the idea
that a person's attitude toward his fellows
is more important than mere professions.
The line "Write me as one that loves his
fellow men" is on Hunt's tomb in Kensal
Green Cemetery, London.</div>

<div class='center'>LEIGH HUNT<br /><br /></div>

Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)<br />
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,<br />
And saw, within the moonlight in his room,<br />
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,<br />
An angel writing in a book of gold:<br />
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,<br />
And to the presence in the room he said,<br />
"What writest thou?"&mdash;the vision rais'd its head,<br />
And with a look made all of sweet accord,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>Answer'd, "The names of those that love the Lord."<br />
"And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so,"<br />
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,<br />
But cheerly still; and said, "I pray thee, then,<br />
Write me as one that loves his fellow men."<br />
The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night<br />
It came again with a great wakening light,<br />
And show'd the names whom love of God had blest,<br />
And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.<br />

<h3><br /><a name="Note_353" id="Note_353">353</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Lord Byron (1788-1824) was the most popular
of English poets in his day. His fame
has since declined, although his fiery,
impetuous nature, expressing itself in
rapid verse of great rhetorical and satiric
power, still reaches kindred spirits. His
"Prisoner of Chillon" is often studied in
the upper grades. It is full of the passion
for freedom which was the dominating
idea in Byron's work as it was in his life.
He gave his life for this idea, striving to
help the Greeks gain their independence.
The poem which follows is from an early
work called <i>Hebrew Melodies</i>. We learn
from II Chronicles 32:21 that Sennacherib,
King of Assyria, having invaded
Judah, Hezekiah cried unto heaven, "And
the Lord sent an angel, which cut off the
mighty men of valor, and the leaders and
captains in the camp of the King of Assyria.
So he returned with shame of face to his
own land." Byron's title seems to indicate
that Sennacherib was himself destroyed.
The fine swinging measure of the lines, and
the vivid picture of the destroyed hosts in
contrast to the brilliant glory of their
triumphant invasion, are two of the chief
elements in its appeal.</div>


<h4><br />THE DESTRUCTION OF
SENNACHERIB</h4>

<div class='center'>LORD BYRON<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold,<br />
And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;<br />
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,<br />
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.<br />
<br />
Like the leaves of the forest when summer is green,<br />
That host with their banners at sunset were seen:<br />
Like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown,<br />
The host on the morrow lay wither'd and strown.<br />
<br />
For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,<br />
And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;<br />
And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,<br />
And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!<br />
<br />
And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,<br />
But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride:<br />
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,<br />
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.<br />
<br />
And there lay the rider distorted and pale,<br />
With the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail;<br />
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,<br />
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.<br />
<br />
And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,<br />
And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;<br />
And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,<br />
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord.<br />

youth and the maturity of America's first

(1794-1878), although neither is in the
style that characterizes his nature verse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
He wrote "To a Waterfowl" in 1815.
When he had completed his study of law,
he set out on foot to find a village where
he might begin work as a lawyer. He was
poor and without friends. At the end of
a day's journey, when he began to feel
discouraged, he saw a wild duck flying
alone high in the sky. Then the thought
came to him that he would be guided
aright, just as the bird was, and he wrote
"To a Waterfowl," the most artistic of
all his poems. The poem is suitable for

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vainly the fowler's eye</span><br />

The desert and illimitable air&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lone wandering, but not lost.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All day thy wings have fanned</span><br />
At that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere,<br />
Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though the dark night is near.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And soon that toil shall end;</span><br />
Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,<br />
And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon, o'er thy sheltered nest.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven</span><br />
Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart<br />
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shall not soon depart.</span><br />

Cleave the tough greensward with the spade:<br />
Wide let its hollow bed be made;<br />
There gently lay the roots, and there<br />
Sift the dark mould with kindly care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And press it o'er them tenderly,</span><br />
As, round the sleeping infant's feet,<br />
We softly fold the cradle-sheet;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So plant we the apple-tree.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What plant we in this apple-tree?</span><br />
Buds, which the breath of summer days<br />
Shall lengthen into leafy sprays;<br />
Boughs where the thrush, with crimson breast,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>Shall haunt, and sing, and hide her nest;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We plant, upon the sunny lea,</span><br />
A shadow for the noontide hour,<br />
A shelter from the summer shower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When we plant the apple-tree.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What plant we in this apple-tree?</span><br />
Sweets for a hundred flowery springs<br />
To load the May-wind's restless wings,<br />
When, from the orchard row, he pours<br />
Its fragrance through our open doors;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A world of blossoms for the bee,</span><br />
Flowers for the sick girl's silent room,<br />
For the glad infant sprigs of bloom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We plant with the apple-tree.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What plant we in this apple-tree?</span><br />
Fruits that shall swell in sunny June,<br />
And redden in the August noon,<br />
And drop, when gentle airs come by,<br />
That fan the blue September sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While children come, with cries of glee,</span><br />
And seek them where the fragrant grass<br />
Betrays their bed to those who pass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the foot of the apple-tree.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when, above this apple-tree,</span><br />
The winter stars are quivering bright,<br />
And winds go howling through the night,<br />
Girls, whose young eyes o'erflow with mirth,<br />
Shall peel its fruit by cottage-hearth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And guests in prouder homes shall see,</span><br />
Heaped with the grape of Cintra's vine<br />
And golden orange of the line,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fruit of the apple-tree.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fruitage of this apple-tree</span><br />
Winds and our flag of stripe and star<br />
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar,<br />
Where men shall wonder at the view,<br />
And ask in what fair groves they grew;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sojourners beyond the sea</span><br />
Shall think of childhood's careless day,<br />
And long, long hours of summer play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the shade of the apple-tree.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each year shall give this apple-tree</span><br />
A broader flush of roseate bloom,<br />
A deeper maze of verdurous gloom,<br />
And loosen, when the frost-clouds lower,<br />
The crisp brown leaves in thicker shower.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The years shall come and pass, but we</span><br />
Shall hear no longer, where we lie,<br />
The summer's songs, the autumn's sigh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the boughs of the apple-tree.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And time shall waste this apple-tree.</span><br />
Oh, when its ag&egrave;d branches throw<br />
Thin shadows on the ground below,<br />
Shall fraud and force and iron will<br />
Oppress the weak and helpless still?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What shall the tasks of mercy be,</span><br />
Amid the toils, the strifes, the tears<br />
Of those who live when length of years<br />

<div class="hang1">The next poem, by the English poet Thomas
Edward Brown (1830-1897), deserves to
be classed with the most beautiful and
artistic verse in our language. Students
will notice the allusion to the biblical
tradition that God walked in the Garden
of Eden in the cool of the evening.</div>


<h4><br />MY GARDEN</h4>

<div class='center'>THOMAS EDWARD BROWN<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
A garden is a lovesome thing, God wot!<br />
Rose plot,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>Fringed pool,<br />

Not God! in gardens! when the eve is cool?<br />
Nay, but I have a sign;<br />
'T is very sure God walks in mine.<br />

<div class="hang1">William Wordsworth (1770-1850) ranks very
high among English poets. He endeavored
to bring poetry close to actual life and to
get rid of the stilted language of conventional
verse. The struggle was long
and difficult, but Wordsworth lived long
enough to know that the world had realized
his greatness. Many of his poems are
suitable for use with children. Their
simplicity, their directness, and their utter
sincerity made many of them, while not
written especially for the young, seem as
if directly addressed to the childlike mind.
"We are Seven," "Lucy Gray," and
"Michael" belong to this number, as do
the two masterpieces among short poems
which are quoted here. "How many
people," exclaims Dr. Oliver Wendell
Holmes, "have been waked to a quicker
consciousness of life by Wordsworth's simple
lines about the daffodils, and what he says
of the thoughts suggested to him by 'the
meanest flower that blows'!" In both
poems the imagery is of the utmost importance.
Through it the reader is able to
put himself with the poet and see things
as the poet saw them. In "The Daffodils"
the flowers, jocund in the breeze, drive away
the melancholy mood with which the poet
had approached them and enable him to
carry away a picture in his memory that
can be drawn upon for help on future
occasions of gloom. In "The Solitary
Reaper" the weird and haunting notes of
the song coming to his ear in an unknown
tongue suggest possible ideas back of the
strong feeling which he recognizes in the
singer. Here also, the poet's memory
carries something away,</div>

<div class='poem'>
"The music in my heart I bore,<br />
Long after it was heard no more."<br />
</div>

<div class='hang1'><br />One of the purposes in teaching poetry
should be to store the mind, not with words
only, but with impressions that may later
be recalled to beautify and strengthen life.</div>


<h4><br />DAFFODILS</h4>

<div class='center'>WILLIAM WORDSWORTH<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
I wander'd lonely as a cloud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</span><br />
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A host, of golden daffodils;</span><br />
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br />
<br />
Continuous as the stars that shine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And twinkle on the Milky Way,</span><br />
They stretch'd in never-ending line<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along the margin of a bay:</span><br />
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br />
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br />
<br />
The waves beside them danced, but they<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Outdid the sparkling waves in glee:</span><br />
A poet could not but be gay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In such a jocund company:</span><br />
I gazed&mdash;and gazed&mdash;but little thought<br />
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br />
<br />
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In vacant or in pensive mood,</span><br />
They flash upon that inward eye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which is the bliss of solitude;</span><br />
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br />
And dances with the daffodils.<br />

Behold her, single in the field,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yon solitary highland lass!</span><br />
Reaping and singing by herself;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stop here, or gently pass!</span><br />
Alone she cuts and binds the grain,<br />
And sings a melancholy strain;<br />
Oh, listen! for the vale profound<br />
Is overflowing with the sound.<br />
<br />
No nightingale did ever chant<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More welcome notes to weary bands</span><br />
Of travelers in some shady haunt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Among Arabian sands:</span><br />
A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard<br />
In spring-time from the cuckoo-bird,<br />
Breaking the silence of the seas<br />
Among the farthest Hebrides.<br />
<br />
Will no one tell me what she sings?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow</span><br />
For old, unhappy, far-off things,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And battles long ago!</span><br />
Or is it some more humble lay,<br />
Familiar matter of to-day?<br />
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,<br />
That has been, and may be again?<br />
<br />
Whate'er the theme, the maiden sang<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if her song could have no ending:</span><br />
I saw her singing at her work,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And o'er the sickle bending;&mdash;</span><br />
I listen'd, motionless and still;<br />
And, as I mounted up the hill,<br />
The music in my heart I bore,<br />
Long after it was heard no more.<br />

among the great poets, but she wrote
several poems that were immense favorites

Among them are "Bingen on the Rhine,"

<div class='center'>CAROLINE E. NORTON<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem2'>
My beautiful! my beautiful! that standest meekly by,<br />
With thy proudly arched and glossy neck, and dark and fiery eye,<br />
Fret not to roam the desert now, with all thy wing&egrave;d speed;<br />
I may not mount on thee again,&mdash;thou'rt sold, my Arab steed!<br />
Fret not with that impatient hoof,&mdash;snuff not the breezy wind,&mdash;<br />
The farther that thou fliest now, so far am I behind;<br />
The stranger hath thy bridle-rein,&mdash;thy master hath his gold,&mdash;<br />
Fleet-limbed and beautiful, farewell; thou'rt sold, my steed, thou'rt sold.<br />
<br />
Farewell! those free untired limbs full many a mile must roam,<br />
To reach the chill and wintry sky which clouds the stranger's home;<br />
Some other hand, less fond, must now thy corn and bed prepare,<br />
Thy silky mane, I braided once, must be another's care!<br />
The morning sun shall dawn again, but never more with thee<br />
Shall I gallop through the desert paths, where we were wont to be;<br />
Evening shall darken on the earth, and o'er the sandy plain<br />
Some other steed, with slower step, shall bear me home again.<br />
<br />
Yes, thou must go! the wild, free breeze, the brilliant sun and sky,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>Thy master's house,&mdash;from all of these my exiled one must fly;<br />
Thy proud dark eye will grow less proud, thy step become less fleet,<br />
And vainly shalt thou arch thy neck, thy master's hand to meet.<br />
Only in sleep shall I behold that dark eye, glancing bright;&mdash;<br />
Only in sleep shall hear again that step so firm and light;<br />
And when I raise my dreaming arm to check or cheer thy speed,<br />
Then must I, starting, wake to feel,&mdash;thou'rt sold, my Arab steed.<br />
<br />
Ah! rudely then, unseen by me, some cruel hand may chide,<br />
Till foam-wreaths lie, like crested waves, along thy panting side:<br />
And the rich blood that's in thee swells, in thy indignant pain,<br />
Till careless eyes, which rest on thee, may count each starting vein.<br />
Will they ill-use thee? If I thought&mdash;but no, it cannot be,&mdash;<br />
Thou art so swift, yet easy curbed; so gentle, yet so free:<br />
And yet, if haply, when thou'rt gone, my lonely heart should yearn,<br />
Can the hand which casts thee from it now command thee to return?<br />
<br />
Return! alas! my Arab steed! what shall thy master do,<br />
When thou, who wast his all of joy, hast vanished from his view?<br />
When the dim distance cheats mine eye, and through the gathering tears<br />
Thy bright form, for a moment, like the false mirage appears;<br />
Slow and unmounted shall I roam, with weary step alone,<br />
Where, with fleet step and joyous bound, thou oft hast borne me on;<br />
And sitting down by that green well, I'll pause and sadly think,<br />
"It was here he bowed his glossy neck when last I saw him drink!"<br />
<br />
When last I saw thee drink!&mdash;Away! the fevered dream is o'er,&mdash;<br />
I could not live a day, and know that we should meet no more!<br />
They tempted me, my beautiful! for hunger's power is strong,&mdash;<br />
They tempted me, my beautiful! but I have loved too long.<br />
Who said that I had given thee up? who said that thou wast sold?<br />
'T is false!&mdash;'t is false, my Arab steed! I fling them back their gold!<br />
Thus, thus, I leap upon thy back, and scour the distant plains;<br />
Away! who overtakes us now shall claim thee for his pains!<br />

<div class="hang1">Robert Southey (1774-1843) was poet laureate
of England, and a most prolific writer of
poetry and miscellaneous prose. His great
prominence in his own day has been succeeded
by an obscurity so complete that
only a few items of his work are now remembered.
Among these are "The Battle
of Blenheim," a very brief and effective
satire against war, "The Well of St. Keyne,"
a humorous poem based on an old superstition,
and "The Inchcape Rock," a stirring
narrative of how evil deeds return
upon the evil doer. (See also No. <a href="#Note_153">153</a>.)</div>


<h4><br />THE INCHCAPE ROCK</h4>

<div class='center'>ROBERT SOUTHEY<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,<br />
The ship was as still as she could be;<br />
Her sails from Heaven received no motion,<br />
Her keel was steady in the ocean.<br />
<br />
Without either sign or sound of their shock,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>The waves flowed over the Inchcape Rock;<br />
So little they rose, so little they fell,<br />
They did not move the Inchcape Bell.<br />
<br />
The holy Abbot of Aberbrothok<br />
Had placed that bell on the Inchcape Rock;<br />
On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung,<br />
And over the waves its warning rung.<br />
<br />
When the rock was hid by the surges' swell,<br />
The mariners heard the warning bell;<br />
And then they knew the perilous Rock,<br />
And blessed the Abbot of Aberbrothok.<br />
<br />
The Sun in heaven was shining gay,<br />
All things were joyful on that day;<br />
The sea-birds screamed as they wheeled around,<br />
And there was joyance in their sound.<br />
<br />
The buoy of the Inchcape Rock was seen,<br />
A darker speck on the ocean green;<br />
Sir Ralph, the Rover, walked his deck,<br />
And he fixed his eye on the darker speck.<br />
<br />
He felt the cheering power of spring,<br />
It made him whistle, it made him sing;<br />
His heart was mirthful to excess;<br />
But the Rover's mirth was wickedness.<br />
<br />
His eye was on the Inchcape float;<br />
Quoth he, "My men, put out the boat;<br />
And row me to the Inchcape Rock,<br />
And I'll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothok."<br />
<br />
The boat is lowered, the boatmen row,<br />
And to the Inchcape Rock they go;<br />
Sir Ralph bent over from the boat,<br />
And cut the Bell from the Inchcape float.<br />
<br />
Down sank the Bell with a gurgling sound;<br />
The bubbles rose, and burst around.<br />
Quoth Sir Ralph, "The next who comes to the Rock<br />
Will not bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok."<br />
<br />
Sir Ralph, the Rover, sailed away,<br />
He scoured the seas for many a day;<br />
And now, grown rich with plundered store,<br />
He steers his course for Scotland's shore.<br />
<br />
So thick a haze o'erspreads the sky<br />
They cannot see the Sun on high;<br />
The wind hath blown a gale all day;<br />
At evening it hath died away.<br />
<br />
On the deck the Rover takes his stand;<br />
So dark it is they see no land.<br />
Quoth Sir Ralph, "It will be lighter soon,<br />
For there is the dawn of the rising Moon."<br />
<br />
"Canst hear," said one, "the breakers roar?<br />
For yonder, methinks, should be the shore.<br />
Now where we are I cannot tell,<br />
But I wish we could hear the Inchcape Bell."<br />
<br />
They hear no sound; the swell is strong;<br />
Though the wind hath fallen, they drift along,<br />
Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock,&mdash;<br />
"O Christ! it is the Inchcape Rock."<br />
<br />
Sir Ralph, the Rover, tore his hair;<br />
He cursed himself in his despair.<br />
The waves rush in on every side;<br />
The ship is sinking beneath the tide.<br />
<br />
But even in his dying fear,<br />
One dreadful sound he seemed to hear,&mdash;<br />
A sound as if, with the Inchcape Bell,<br />
The Devil below was ringing his knell.<br /><br /><br /></div>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By all their country's wishes blest!</span><br />
When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Returns to deck their hallowed mould,</span><br />
She there shall dress a sweeter sod<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.</span><br />
<br />
By fairy hands their knell is rung;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By forms unseen their dirge is sung;</span><br />
There Honor comes, a pilgrim gray,<br />

And Freedom shall awhile repair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To dwell a weeping hermit there!</span><br />

<div class="hang1">The anonymous ballad dealing with the familiar
story of Nathan Hale, of Revolutionary
times, is the nearest approach to the old
folk ballad in our history. Its repetitions
help it in catching something of the breathless
suspense accompanying his daring
effort, betrayal, and execution. The pathos
of the closing incidents of Hale's career has
attracted the tributes of poets and dramatists.
Francis Miles Finch, author of
"The Blue and the Gray," wrote a well-known
poetic account of Hale, while Clyde
Fitch's drama of <i>Nathan Hale</i> had a great
popular success.</div>


<h4><br />THE BALLAD OF
NATHAN HALE</h4>

<div class='poem2'>
The breezes went steadily through the tall pines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A-saying "Oh! hu-ush!" a-saying "Oh! hu-ush!"</span><br />
As stilly stole by a bold legion of horse,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Hale in the bush; for Hale in the bush.</span><br />
<br />
"Keep still!" said the thrush as she nestled her young,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a nest by the road; in a nest by the road.</span><br />
"For the tyrants are near, and with them appear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What bodes us no good; what bodes us no good."</span><br />
<br />
The brave captain heard it, and thought of his home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a cot by the brook; in a cot by the brook;</span><br />
With mother and sister and memories dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He so gayly forsook; he so gayly forsook.</span><br />
<br />
Cooling shades of the night were coming apace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tattoo had beat; the tattoo had beat.</span><br />
The noble one sprang from his dark lurking-place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make his retreat; to make his retreat.</span><br />
<br />
He warily trod on the dry rustling leaves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he passed through the wood; as he passed through the wood;</span><br />
And silently gained his rude launch on the shore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As she played with the flood; as she played with the flood.</span><br />
<br />
The guards of the camp, on that dark, dreary night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had a murderous will; had a murderous will.</span><br />
They took him and bore him afar from the shore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a hut on the hill; to a hut on the hill.</span><br />
<br />
No mother was there, nor a friend who could cheer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that little stone cell; in that little stone cell.</span><br />
But he trusted in love, from his Father above.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his heart, all was well; in his heart, all was well.</span><br />
<br />
An ominous owl, with his solemn bass voice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sat moaning hard by; sat moaning hard by;</span><br />
"The tyrant's proud minions most gladly rejoice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he must soon die; for he must soon die."</span><br />
<br />
The brave fellow told them, no thing he restrained,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cruel general! the cruel general!&mdash;</span><br />
His errand from camp, of the ends to be gained,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said that was all; and said that was all.</span><br />
<br />
They took him and bound him and bore him away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down the hill's grassy side; down the hill's grassy side.</span><br />
'Twas there the base hirelings, in royal array,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His cause did deride; his cause did deride.</span><br />
<br />
Five minutes were given, short moments, no more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For him to repent; for him to repent.</span><br />
He prayed for his mother, he asked not another,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Heaven he went; to Heaven he went.</span><br />
<br />
The faith of a martyr the tragedy showed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he trod the last stage; as he trod the last stage.</span><br />
And Britons will shudder at gallant Hale's blood,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">As his words do presage; as his words do presage:</span><br />
<br />
"Thou pale King of terrors, thou life's gloomy foe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Go frighten the slave; go frighten the slave;</span><br />
Tell tyrants, to you their allegiance they owe.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No fears for the brave; no fears for the brave."</span><br />

<div class="hang1">That men of great courage are certain to
recognize and pay tribute to courage in
others, even if those others are their enemies,
is the theme of "The Red Thread of
Honor." Sir Francis Hastings Doyle (1810-1888)
wrote two other stirring poems of
action, "The Loss of the Birkenhead" and
"The Private of the Buffs."</div>


<h4><br />THE RED THREAD OF
HONOR</h4>

<div class='center'>FRANCIS HASTINGS DOYLE<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Eleven men of England<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A breastwork charged in vain;</span><br />
Eleven men of England<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lie stripp'd, and gash'd, and slain.</span><br />
Slain; but of foes that guarded<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their rock-built fortress well,</span><br />
Some twenty had been mastered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the last soldier fell.</span><br />
<br />
The robber-chief mused deeply,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above those daring dead;</span><br />
"Bring here," at length he shouted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Bring quick, the battle thread.</span><br />
Let Eblis blast forever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their souls, if Allah will:</span><br />
But we must keep unbroken<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old rules of the Hill.</span><br />
<br />
"Before the Ghiznee tiger<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leapt forth to burn and slay;</span><br />
Before the holy Prophet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Taught our grim tribes to pray;</span><br />
Before Secunder's lances<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pierced through each Indian glen;</span><br />
The mountain laws of honor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were framed for fearless men.</span><br />
<br />
"Still, when a chief dies bravely,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We bind with green one wrist&mdash;</span><br />
Green for the brave, for heroes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One crimson thread we twist.</span><br />
Say ye, oh gallant Hillmen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For these, whose life has fled,</span><br />
Which is the fitting color,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The green one, or the red?"</span><br />
<br />
"Our brethren, laid in honor'd graves, may wear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their green reward," each noble savage said;</span><br />
"To these, whom hawks and hungry wolves shall tear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who dares deny the red?"</span><br />
<br />
Thus conquering hate, and steadfast to the right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fresh from the heart that haughty verdict came;</span><br />
Beneath a waning moon, each spectral height<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rolled back its loud acclaim.</span><br />
<br />
Once more the chief gazed keenly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down on those daring dead;</span><br />
From his good sword their heart's blood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crept to that crimson thread.</span><br />
Once more he cried, "The judgment,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Good friends, is wise and true,</span><br />
But though the red be given,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have we not more to do?</span><br />
<br />
"These were not stirred by anger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor yet by lust made bold;</span><br />
Renown they thought above them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor did they look for gold.</span><br />
To them their leader's signal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was as the voice of God:</span><br />
Unmoved, and uncomplaining,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The path it showed they trod.</span><br />
<br />
"As, without sound or struggle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The stars unhurrying march,</span><br />
Where Allah's finger guides them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through yonder purple arch,</span><br />
These Franks, sublimely silent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without a quickened breath,</span><br />
Went, in the strength of duty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Straight to their goal of death.</span><br />
<br />
"If I were now to ask you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To name our bravest man,</span><br />
Ye all at once would answer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They call'd him Mehrab Khan.</span><br />
He sleeps among his fathers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dear to our native land,</span><br />
With the bright mark he bled for<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Firm round his faithful hand.</span><br />
<br />
"The songs they sing of Roostum<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fill all the past with light;</span><br />
If truth be in their music,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was a noble knight.</span><br />
But were those heroes living,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And strong for battle still,</span><br />
Would Mehrab Khan or Roostum<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have climbed, like these, the Hill?"</span><br />
<br />
And they replied, "Though Mehrab Khan was brave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As chief, he chose himself what risks to run;</span><br />
Prince Roostum lied, his forfeit life to save,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which these had never done."</span><br />
<br />
"Enough!" he shouted fiercely;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Doomed though they be to hell,</span><br />
Bind fast the crimson trophy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round <span class="smcap">both</span> wrists&mdash;bind it well.</span><br />
Who knows but that great Allah<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May grudge such matchless men,</span><br />
With none so decked in heaven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the fiend's flaming den?"</span><br />
<br />
Then all those gallant robbers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shouted a stern "Amen!"</span><br />
They raised the slaughter'd sergeant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They raised his mangled ten.</span><br />
And when we found their bodies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Left bleaching in the wind,</span><br />
Around <span class="smcap">both</span> wrists in glory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That crimson thread was twined.</span><br />

<div class="hang1">In the year 1897 a great diamond jubilee
was held in England in honor of the completion
of sixty years of rule by Queen
Victoria. Many poems were written for
the occasion, most of which praised the
greatness of Britain, the extent of her
dominion, the strength of her army and
navy, and the abundance of her wealth.
The "Recessional" was written for the
occasion by Rudyard Kipling (1865&mdash;). It
is in the form of a prayer, but its purpose
was to tell the British that they were forgetting
the "God of our fathers" and putting
their trust in wealth and navies and
the "reeking tube and iron shard" of the
cannon. The poem rang through England
like a bugle call and stirred the British
people more deeply than any other poem
of recent times.</div>

<div class="hang1">William Ernest Henley (1849-1903) was an
English critic and journalist of great force
and a poet whose verse is full of manliness
and tenderness. His life was a constant
and courageous struggle against disease.
The spirit in which he faced conditions
that would have conquered a weaker man
breathes through the famous poem quoted
below. Such a spirit is not confined to
any particular stage of maturity as represented
by years, and many young people
will find themselves buoyed up in the face
of difficulties by coming into touch with
the unconquered and unconquerable voice
in this poem. The last two lines in particular

In the fell clutch of circumstance<br />

of such high idealisms that many of his
poems seem to form the natural heritage
of youth. Among such are "The Vision

"The Fatherland," and "Aladdin." "The
Falcon" is not so well known as any of
these, but its fine image for the seeker

an old myth (see No. <a href="#Note_261">261</a>) and lets us see

<h4><br />THE SHEPHERD OF KING
ADMETUS</h4>

<div class='center'>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
There came a youth upon the earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some thousand years ago,</span><br />
Whose slender hands were nothing worth,<br />
Whether to plough, or reap, or sow.<br />
<br />
Upon an empty tortoise-shell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He stretched some chords, and drew</span><br />
Music that made men's bosoms swell<br />
Fearless, or brimmed their eyes with dew.<br />
<br />
Then King Admetus, one who had<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pure taste by right divine,</span><br />
Decreed his singing not too bad<br />
To hear between the cups of wine:<br />
<br />
And so, well pleased with being soothed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into a sweet half-sleep,</span><br />
Three times his kingly beard he smoothed,<br />
And made him viceroy o'er his sheep.<br />
<br />
His words were simple words enough,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet he used them so,</span><br />
That what in other mouths was rough<br />
In his seemed musical and low.<br />
<br />
Men called him but a shiftless youth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In whom no good they saw;</span><br />
And yet, unwittingly, in truth,<br />
They made his careless words their law.<br />
<br />
They knew not how he learned at all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For idly, hour by hour,</span><br />
He sat and watched the dead leaves fall,<br />
Or mused upon a common flower.<br />
<br />
It seemed the loveliness of things<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did teach him all their use,</span><br />
For, in mere weeds, and stones, and springs,<br />
He found a healing power profuse.<br />
<br />
Men granted that his speech was wise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, when a glance they caught</span><br />
Of his slim grace and woman's eyes,<br />
They laughed, and called him good-for-naught.<br />
<br />
Yet after he was dead and gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And e'en his memory dim,</span><br />
Earth seemed more sweet to live upon,<br />
More full of love, because of him.<br />
<br />
And day by day more holy grew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each spot where he had trod,</span><br />
Till after-poets only knew<br />
Their first-born brother as a god.<br />

<div class="hang1">Sir William S. Gilbert (1837-1911), an English
dramatist, is known to us as the librettist
of the popular Gilbert and Sullivan
operas, <i>The Mikado</i>, <i>Pinafore</i>, etc. In his
earlier days he wrote a book of humorous
poetry called <i>The Bab Ballads</i>. Many of
these still please readers who like a little
nonsense now and then of a supremely ridiculous
type. "The Yarn of the Nancy Bell"
is a splendid take-off on "travelers' tales,"
and is not likely to deceive anyone. However,
Gilbert said that when he sent the poem
to <i>Punch</i>, the editor made objection to its
extremely cannibalistic nature!</div>


<h4><br />THE YARN OF THE
NANCY BELL</h4>

<div class='center'>WILLIAM S. GILBERT<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
'Twas on the shores that round our coast<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Deal to Ramsgate span,</span><br />
That I found alone on a piece of stone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An elderly naval man.</span><br />
<br />
His hair was weedy, his beard was long,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And weedy and long was he,</span><br />
And I heard this wight on the shore recite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a singular minor key:</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the mate of the Nancy brig,</span><br />
And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the crew of the captain's gig."</span><br />
<br />
And he shook his fists and he tore his hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till I really felt afraid,</span><br />
For I couldn't help thinking the man had been drinking,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so I simply said:</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, elderly man, it's little I know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the duties of men of the sea,</span><br />
And I'll eat my hand if I understand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">However you can be</span><br />
<br />
"At once a cook, and a captain bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the mate of the Nancy brig,</span><br />
And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the crew of the captain's gig."</span><br />
<br />
Then he gave a hitch to his trousers, which<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is a trick all seamen larn,</span><br />
And having got rid of a thumping quid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He spun this painful yarn:</span><br />
<br />
"'Twas in the good ship Nancy Bell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That we sailed to the Indian Sea,</span><br />
And there on a reef we come to grief,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which has often occurred to me.</span><br />
<br />
"And pretty nigh all the crew was drowned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(There was seventy-seven o' soul),</span><br />
And only ten of the Nancy's men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said 'Here!' to the muster-roll.</span><br />
<br />
"There was me and the cook and the captain bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the mate of the Nancy brig,</span><br />
And the bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the crew of the captain's gig.</span><br />
<br />
"For a month we'd neither wittles nor drink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till a-hungry we did feel,</span><br />
So we drawed a lot, and accordin' shot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The captain for our meal.</span><br />
<br />
"The next lot fell to the Nancy's mate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a delicate dish he made;</span><br />
Then our appetite with the midshipmite<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We seven survivors stayed.</span><br />
<br />
"And then we murdered the bo'sun tight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he much resembled pig;</span><br />
Then we wittled free, did the cook and me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the crew of the captain's gig.</span><br />
<br />
"Then only the cook and me was left,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the delicate question, 'Which</span><br />
Of us two goes to the kettle?' arose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we argued it out as sich.</span><br />
<br />
"For I loved that cook as a brother, I did,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the cook he worshipped me;</span><br />
But we'd both be blowed if we'd either be stowed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the other chap's hold, you see.</span><br />
<br />
"'I'll be eat if you dines off me,' says Tom;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Yes, that,' says I, 'you'll be,'&mdash;</span><br />
'I'm boiled if I die, my friend,' quoth I;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And 'Exactly so,' quoth he.</span><br />
<br />
"Says he, 'Dear James, to murder me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were a foolish thing to do;</span><br />
For don't you see that you can't cook me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While I can&mdash;and will&mdash;cook <i>you!</i>'</span><br />
<br />
"So he boils the water, and takes the salt<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the pepper in portions true</span><br />
(Which he never forgot), and some chopped shalot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some sage and parsley, too.</span><br />
<br />
"'Come here,' says he, with a proper pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which his smiling features tell,</span><br />
''T will soothing be if I let you see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How extremely nice you'll smell.'</span><br />
<br />
"And he stirred it round and round and round<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he sniffed at the foaming froth;</span><br />
When I ups with his heels and smothers his squeals<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the scum of the boiling broth.</span><br />
<br />
"And I eat that cook in a week or less,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And&mdash;as I eating be</span><br />
The last of his chops, why, I almost drops,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a wessel in sight I see!</span><br />
<br />
<hr style='width: 45%;' /><br />
<br />
"'And I never larf, and never smile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I never lark nor play,</span><br />
But sit and croak, and a single joke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have&mdash;which is to say:</span><br />
<br />
"'Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the mate of the Nancy brig,</span><br />
And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the crew of the captain's gig!'"</span><br />

<h4><br />DARIUS GREEN AND HIS
FLYING MACHINE</h4>

<div class='center'>JOHN TOWNSEND TROWBRIDGE<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
If ever there lived a Yankee lad,<br />
Wise or otherwise, good or bad,<br />
Who, seeing the birds fly, didn't jump<br />
With flapping arms from stake or stump,<br />
Or, spreading the tail of his coat for a sail,<br />
Take a soaring leap from post or rail,<br />
And wonder why he couldn't fly,<br />
And flap and flutter and wish and try,&mdash;<br />
If ever you knew a country dunce<br />
Who didn't try that as often as once,<br />
All I can say is, that's a sign<br />
He never would do for a hero of mine.<br />
<br />
An aspiring genius was D. Green;<br />
The son of a farmer,&mdash;age fourteen;<br />
His body was long and lank and lean,&mdash;<br />
Just right for flying, as will be seen;<br />
He had two eyes as bright as a bean,<br />
And a freckled nose that grew between,<br />
A little awry;&mdash;for I must mention<br />
That he had riveted his attention<br />
Upon his wonderful invention,<br />
Twisting his tongue as he twisted the strings,<br />
And working his face as he worked the wings,<br />
And with every turn of gimlet and screw<br />
Turning and screwing his mouth round too,<br />
Till his nose seemed bent to catch the scent,<br />
Around some corner, of new-baked pies,<br />
And his wrinkled cheek and his squinting eyes<br />
Grew puckered into a queer grimace,<br />
That made him look very droll in the face,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">And also very wise.</span><br />
And wise he must have been, to do more<br />
Than ever a genius did before,<br />
Excepting Daedalus of yore<br />
And his son Icarus, who wore<br />
Upon their backs those wings of wax<br />
He had read of in the old almanacs.<br />
Darius was clearly of the opinion,<br />
That the air was also man's dominion,<br />
And that with paddle or fin or pinion,<br />
We soon or late should navigate<br />
The azure as now we sail the sea.<br />
The thing looks simple enough to me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And, if you doubt it,</span><br />
Hear how Darius reasoned about it:<br />
"The birds can fly, an' why can't I?<br />
Must we give in," says he with a grin,<br />
"'T the bluebird an' phoebe are smarter'n we be?<br />
Jest fold our hands, an' see the swaller<br />
An' blackbird an' catbird beat us holler?<br />
Does the leetle chatterin', sassy wren,<br />
No bigger'n my thumb, know more than men?<br />
Jest show me that! er prove 't bat<br />
Hez got more brains than's in my hat,<br />
An' I'll back down, an' not till then!"<br />
He argued further: "Ner I can't see<br />
What's the use o' wings to a bumble-bee,<br />
Fer to git a livin' with, more'n to me;&mdash;<br />
Ain't my business importanter'n his'n is?<br />
That Icarus was a silly cuss,&mdash;<br />
Him an' his daddy Daedalus;<br />
They might 'a' knowed wings made o' wax<br />
Wouldn't stan' sun-heat an' hard whacks:<br />
I'll make mine o' luther, er suthin' er other."<br />
<br />
And he said to himself, as he tinkered and planned:<br />
"But I ain't goin' to show my hand<br />
To nummies that never can understand<br />
The fust idee that's big an' grand.<br />
They'd 'a' laft an' made fun<br />
O' Creation itself afore it was done!"<br />
So he kept his secret from all the rest,<br />
Safely buttoned within his vest;<br />
And in the loft above the shed<br />
Himself he locks, with thimble and thread<br />
And wax and hammer and buckles and screws,<br />
And all such things as geniuses use;&mdash;<br />
Two bats for patterns, curious fellows!<br />
A charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows;<br />
An old hoop-skirt or two, as well as<br />
Some wire, and several old umbrellas;<br />
A carriage-cover, for tail and wings;<br />
A piece of harness; and straps and strings;<br />
And a big strong box, in which he locks<br />
These and a hundred other things.<br />
<br />
His grinning brothers, Reuben and Burke<br />
And Nathan and Jotham and Solomon, lurk<br />
Around the corner to see him work,&mdash;<br />
Sitting cross-legg&egrave;d, like a Turk,<br />
Drawing the waxed-end through with a jerk,<br />
And boring the holes with a comical quirk<br />
Of his wise old head, and a knowing smirk.<br />
But vainly they mounted each other's backs,<br />
And poked through knot-holes and pried through cracks;<br />
With wood from the pile and straw from the stacks<br />
He plugged the knot-holes and calked the cracks;<br />
And a bucket of water, which one would think<br />
He had brought up into the loft to drink<br />
When he chanced to be dry,<br />
Stood always nigh, for Darius was sly!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>And, whenever at work he happened to spy,<br />
At chink or crevice a blinking eye,<br />
He let a dipper of water fly:<br />
"Take that! an', ef ever ye git a peep,<br />
Guess ye'll ketch a weasel asleep!"<br />
And he sings as he locks his big strong box;<br />
"The weasel's head is small an' trim,<br />
An' he is leetle an' long an' slim,<br />
An' quick of motion an' nimble of limb,<br />
An', ef yeou'll be advised by me,<br />
Keep wide awake when ye're ketching him!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">So day after day</span><br />
He stitched and tinkered and hammered away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Till at last 'twas done,&mdash;</span><br />
The greatest invention under the sun.<br />
"An' now," says Darius, "hooray fer some fun!"<br />
<br />
'Twas the Fourth of July, and the weather was dry,<br />
And not a cloud was on all the sky,<br />
Save a few light fleeces, which here and there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Half mist, half air,</span><br />
Like foam on the ocean went floating by,<br />
Just as lovely a morning as ever was seen<br />
For a nice little trip in a flying-machine.<br />
<br />
Thought cunning Darius, "Now I shan't go<br />
Along 'ith the fellers to see the show:<br />
I'll say I've got sich a terrible cough!<br />
An' then, when the folks have all gone off,<br />
I'll hev full swing fer to try the thing,<br />
An' practyse a little on the wing."<br />
<br />
"Ain't goin' to see the celebration?"<br />
Says brother Nate. "No; botheration!<br />
I've got sich a cold&mdash;a toothache&mdash;I&mdash;<br />
My gracious! feel's though I should fly!"<br />
<br />
Said Jotham, "Sho! guess ye better go."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But Darius said, "No!</span><br />
Shouldn't wonder 'f yeou might see me, though,<br />
'Long 'bout noon, ef I git red<br />
O' this jumpin', thumpin' pain in my head."<br />
For all the while to himself he said,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"I tell ye what!</span><br />
I'll fly a few times around the lot,<br />
To see how 't seems; then soon's I've got<br />
The hang o' the thing, ez likely's not,<br />
I'll astonish the nation, an' all creation,<br />
By flying over the celebration!<br />
Over their heads I'll sail like an eagle;<br />
I'll balance myself on my wings like a sea-gull;<br />
I'll dance on the chimbleys; I'll stan' on the steeple;<br />
I'll flop up to winders an' scare the people!<br />
I'll light on the libbe'ty-pole, an' crow;<br />
An' I'll say to the gawpin' fools below,<br />
'What world's this here that I've come near?'<br />
Fer I'll make 'em b'lieve I'm a chap f'm the moon;<br />
An' I'll try a race 'ith their ol' balloon!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">He crept from his bed;</span><br />
And, seeing the others were gone, he said,<br />
"I'm a-gittin' over the cold 'n my head."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And away he sped,</span><br />
To open the wonderful box in the shed.<br />
<br />
His brothers had walked but a little way,<br />
When Jotham to Nathan chanced to say,<br />
"What on airth is he up to, hey?"<br />
"Don'o',&mdash;the's suthin' er other to pay,<br />
Er he wouldn't 'a' stayed to hum to-day."<br />
Says Burke, "His toothache's all'n his eye!<br />
He never'd miss a Fo'th-o'-July,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>Ef he hadn't got some machine to try."<br />
Then Sol, the little one, spoke: "By darn!<br />
Le's hurry back, an' hide'n the barn,<br />
An' pay him fer tellin' us that yarn!"<br />
<br />
"Agreed!" Through the orchard they creep back,<br />
Along by the fences, behind the stack,<br />
And one by one, through a hole in the wall,<br />
In under the dusty barn they crawl,<br />
Dressed in their Sunday garments all;<br />
And a very astonishing sight was that,<br />
When each in his cobwebbed coat and hat<br />
Came up through the floor like an ancient rat.<br />
And there they hid; and Reuben slid<br />
The fastenings back, and the door undid.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Keep dark," said he,</span><br />
"While I squint an' see what the' is to see."<br />
<br />
As knights of old put on their mail,&mdash;<br />
From head to foot in an iron suit,<br />
Iron jacket and iron boot,<br />
Iron breeches, and on the head<br />
No hat, but an iron pot instead,<br />
And under the chin the bail,&mdash;<br />
(I believe they call the thing a helm,&mdash;)<br />
And, thus accoutred, they took the field,<br />
Sallying forth to overwhelm<br />
The dragons and pagans that plagued the realm;<br />
So this modern knight prepared for flight,<br />
Put on his wings and strapped them tight&mdash;<br />
Jointed and jaunty, strong and light,&mdash;<br />
Buckled them fast to shoulder and hip,&mdash;<br />
Ten feet they measured from tip to tip!<br />
And a helm he had, but that he wore,<br />
Not on his head, like those of yore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But more like the helm of a ship.</span><br />
<br />
"Hush!" Reuben said, "he's up in the shed!<br />
He's opened the winder,&mdash;I see his head!<br />
He stretches it out, an' pokes it about<br />
Lookin' to see 'f the coast is clear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">An' nobody near;&mdash;</span><br />
Guess he don'o' who's hid in here!<br />
He's riggin' a spring-board over the sill!<br />
Stop laffin', Solomon! Burke, keep still!<br />
He's climbin' out now&mdash;Of all the things!<br />
What's he got on? I vum, it's wings!<br />
An' that t'other thing? I vum, it's a tail!<br />
And there he sets like a hawk on a rail!<br />
Steppin' careful, he travels the length<br />
Of his spring-board, and teeters to try its strength,<br />
Now he stretches his wings, like a monstrous bat;<br />
Peeks over his shoulder, this way an' that,<br />
Fer to see 'f the's anyone passin' by;<br />
But the's o'ny a ca'f an' a goslin' nigh.<br />
They turn up at him a wonderin' eye,<br />
To see&mdash;The dragon! he's goin' to fly!<br />
Away he goes! Jimminy! what a jump!<br />
Flop&mdash;flop&mdash;an' plump to the ground with a thump!<br />
Flutt'rin' an' flound'rin', all'n a lump!"<br />
<br />
As a demon is hurled by an angel's spear,<br />
Heels over head, to his proper sphere,&mdash;<br />
Heels over head, and head over heels,<br />
Dizzily down the abyss he wheels,&mdash;<br />
So fell Darius. Upon his crown,<br />
In the midst of the barnyard, he came down,<br />
In a wonderful whirl of tangled strings,<br />
Broken braces and broken springs,<br />
Broken tail and broken wings,<br />
Shooting stars, and various things,&mdash;<br />
Barnyard litter of straw and chaff,<br />
And much that wasn't so sweet by half.<br />
Away with a bellow flew the calf,<br />
And what was that? Did the gosling laugh?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>'Tis a merry roar from the old barn-door,<br />
And he hears the voice of Jotham crying;<br />
"Say, D'rius! how de yeou like flyin'?"<br />
<br />
Slowly, ruefully, where he lay,<br />
Darius just turned and looked that way,<br />
As he stanched his sorrowful nose with his cuff,<br />
"Wal, I like flyin' well enough,"<br />
He said, "but the' ain't sich a thunderin' sight<br />
O' fun in't when ye come to light."<br />
<br />
I just have room for the MORAL here:<br />
And this is the moral,&mdash;Stick to your sphere;<br />
Or, if you insist, as you have the right,<br />
On spreading your wings for a loftier flight,<br />
The moral is,&mdash;Take care how you light.<br />

<div class="hang1">The poem of "Beth G&ecirc;lert" (Grave of G&ecirc;lert)
is really a verse version of an old folk story
that has localized itself in many places
over the world. In Wales they can show
you where G&ecirc;lert is buried, which illustrates
how such a favorite story takes hold
of the popular mind. The poem by William
Robert Spencer (1769-1834) has so much
of the spirit of the old ballads which it
imitates that it was believed at first to be
a genuine example of one.</div>


<h4><br />BETH G&Ecirc;LERT</h4>

<div class='center'>WILLIAM ROBERT SPENCER<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
The spearmen heard the bugle sound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cheerly smiled the morn;</span><br />
And many a brach, and many a hound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Obeyed Llewellyn's horn.</span><br />
<br />
And still he blew a louder blast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gave a lustier cheer,</span><br />
"Come, G&ecirc;lert, come, wert never last<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Llewellyn's horn to hear.</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, where does faithful G&ecirc;lert roam.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The flow'r of all his race,</span><br />
So true, so brave,&mdash;a lamb at home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A lion in the chase?"</span><br />
<br />
'Twas only at Llewellyn's board<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The faithful G&ecirc;lert fed;</span><br />
He watched, he served, he cheered his lord,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sentineled his bed.</span><br />
<br />
In sooth he was a peerless hound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gift of royal John;</span><br />
But now no G&ecirc;lert could be found,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the chase rode on.</span><br />
<br />
And now, as o'er the rocks and dells<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gallant chidings rise,</span><br />
All Snowdon's craggy chaos yells<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The many-mingled cries!</span><br />
<br />
That day Llewellyn little loved<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The chase of hart and hare;</span><br />
And scant and small the booty proved,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For G&ecirc;lert was not there.</span><br />
<br />
Unpleased Llewellyn homeward hied,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When, near the portal seat,</span><br />
His truant G&ecirc;lert he espied,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bounding his lord to greet.</span><br />
<br />
But, when he gained his castle door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Aghast the chieftain stood;</span><br />
The hound all o'er was smeared with gore;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His lips, his fangs, ran blood.</span><br />
<br />
Llewellyn gazed with fierce surprise;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unused such looks to meet,</span><br />
His favorite checked his joyful guise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And crouched, and licked his feet.</span><br />
<br />
Onward, in haste, Llewellyn passed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on went G&ecirc;lert too;</span><br />
And still, where'er his eyes he cast,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fresh blood-gouts shocked his view.</span><br />
<br />
O'erturned his infant's bed he found,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The blood-stained covert rent;</span><br />
And all around the walls and ground<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With recent blood besprent.</span><br />
<br />
He called his child,&mdash;no voice replied&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He searched with terror wild;</span><br />
Blood, blood he found on every side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But nowhere found his child.</span><br />
<br />
"Hell-hound! my child's by thee devoured,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The frantic father cried;</span><br />
And to the hilt his vengeful sword<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He plunged in G&ecirc;lert's side.</span><br />
<br />
His suppliant looks, as prone he fell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No pity could impart;</span><br />
But still his G&ecirc;lert's dying yell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passed heavy o'er his heart.</span><br />
<br />
Aroused by G&ecirc;lert's dying yell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some slumberer wakened nigh:</span><br />
What words the parent's joy could tell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hear his infant's cry!</span><br />
<br />
Concealed beneath a tumbled heap<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His hurried search had missed,</span><br />
All glowing from his rosy sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His cherub boy he kissed.</span><br />
<br />
Nor scathe had he, nor harm, nor dread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, the same couch beneath,</span><br />
Lay a gaunt wolf, all torn and dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tremendous still in death.</span><br />
<br />
Ah! what was then Llewellyn's pain!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For now the truth was clear;</span><br />
His gallant hound the wolf had slain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To save Llewellyn's heir:</span><br />
<br />
Vain, vain was all Llewellyn's woe;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Best of thy kind, adieu!</span><br />
The frantic blow which laid thee low<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This heart shall ever rue."</span><br />
<br />
And now a gallant tomb they raise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With costly sculpture decked;</span><br />
And marbles storied with his praise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor G&ecirc;lert's bones protect.</span><br />
<br />
There, never could the spearman pass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or forester, unmoved;</span><br />
There, oft the tear-besprinkled grass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Lleweylln's'">Llewellyn's</ins> sorrow proved.</span><br />
<br />
And there he hung his horn and spear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there, as evening fell,</span><br />
In fancy's ear he oft would hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor G&ecirc;lert's dying yell.</span><br />
<br />
And, till great Snowdon's rocks grow old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cease the storm to brave,</span><br />
The consecrated spot shall hold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The name of "G&ecirc;lert's Grave."</span><br />

<div class="hang1">This old ballad is one of the best of the
humorous type. Many old stories turn
upon some such riddling series of questions,
generally three in number, to which unexpected

How for his house-keeping and high renowne,<br />
They rode poste for him to fair London towne.<br />
<br />
An hundred men, the king did heare say,<br />
The abbot kept in his house every day;<br />
And fifty golde chaynes, without any doubt,<br />
In velvet coates waited the abbot about.<br />
<br />
"How now, father abbot, I heare it of thee,<br />
Thou keepest a farre better house than mee,<br />
And for thy house-keeping and high renowne,<br />
I fear thou work'st treason against my crown."<br />
<br />
"My liege," quo' the abbot, "I would it were knowne,<br />
I never spend nothing but what is my owne;<br />
And I trust your grace will do me no deere<br />
For spending of my owne true-gotten geere."<br />
<br />
"Yes, yes, father abbot, thy fault it is highe,<br />
And now for the same thou needest must dye;<br />
For except thou canst answer me questions three,<br />
Thy head shall be smitten from thy bodie.<br />
<br />
"And first," quo' the king, "when I'm in this stead,<br />
With my crown of golde so faire on my head,<br />
Among all my liege-men so noble of birthe,<br />
Thou must tell me to one penny what I am worthe.<br />
<br />
"Secondlye tell me, without any doubt,<br />
How soone I may ride the whole worlde about.<br />
And at the third question thou must not shrinke,<br />
But tell me here truly what I do thinke."<br />
<br />
"O, these are hard questions for my shallow witt,<br />
Nor I cannot answer your grace as yet;<br />
But if you will give me but three weekes space,<br />
I'll do my endeavour to answer your grace."<br />
<br />
"Now three weekes space to thee will I give,<br />
And that is the longest thou hast to live;<br />
For if thou dost not answer my questions three,<br />
Thy lands and thy living are forfeit to mee."<br />
<br />
Away rode the abbot all sad at that word,<br />
And he rode to Cambridge, and Oxenford;<br />
But never a doctor there was so wise,<br />
That could with his learning an answer devise.<br />
<br />
Then home rode the abbot of comfort so cold,<br />
And he mett his shephard a-going to fold:<br />
"How now, my lord abbot, you are welcome home;<br />
What newes do you bring us from good King John?"<br />
<br />
"Sad newes, sad newes, shephard, I must give;<br />
That I have but three days more to live:<br />
For if I do not answer him questions three,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>My head will be smitten from my bodie.<br />
<br />
"The first is to tell him there in that stead,<br />
With his crowne of golde so faire on his head,<br />
Among all his liege-men so noble of birthe,<br />
To within one penny of what he is worthe.<br />
<br />
"The seconde, to tell him without any doubt,<br />
How soone he may ride this whole worlde about:<br />
And at the third question I must not shrinke,<br />
But tell him there truly what he does thinke."<br />
<br />
"Now cheare up, sire abbot, did you never hear yet<br />
That a fool he may learn a wise man witt?<br />
Lend me horse, and serving-men, and your apparel,<br />
And I'll ride to London to answere your quarrel.<br />
<br />
"Nay, frowne not, if it hath bin told unto mee,<br />
I am like your lordship, as ever may bee;<br />
And if you will but lend me your gowne,<br />
There is none shall knowe us at fair London towne."<br />
<br />
"Now horses and serving-men thou shalt have,<br />
With sumptuous array most gallant and brave;<br />
With crozier, and miter, and rochet, and cope,<br />
Fit to appeare 'fore our fader the pope."<br />
<br />
"Now welcome, sire abbot," the king he did say,<br />
"'Tis well thou'rt come back to keepe thy day:<br />
For and if thou canst answer my questions three,<br />
Thy life and thy living both saved shall bee.<br />
<br />
"And, first, when thou see'st me here in this stead,<br />
With my crown of golde so fair on my head,<br />
Among all my liege-men so noble of birthe,<br />
Tell me to one penny what I am worthe."<br />
<br />
"For thirty pence our Saviour was sold<br />
Among the false Jewes, as I have bin told:<br />
And twenty-nine is the worth of thee,<br />
For I thinke, thou art one penny worser than Hee."<br />
<br />
The king he laugh'd, and swore by St. Bittel,<br />
"I did not think I had been worth so littel!<br />
&mdash;Now secondly, tell me, without any doubt,<br />
How soone I may ride this whole world about."<br />
<br />
"You must rise with the sun, and ride with the same,<br />
Until the next morning he riseth againe;<br />
And then your grace need not make any doubt,<br />
But in twenty-four hours you'll ride it about."<br />
<br />
The king he laugh'd, and swore by St. Jone,<br />
"I did not think it could be done so soone!<br />
&mdash;Now from the third question you must not shrinke,<br />
But tell me here truly what I do thinke."<br />
<br />
"Yes, that shall I do and make your grace merry:<br />
You thinke I'm the Abbot of Canterburye;<br />
But I'm his poor shephard, as plain you may see,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>That am come to beg pardon for him and for mee."<br />
<br />
The king he laughed, and swore by the masse,<br />
"I'll make thee lord abbot this day in his place!"<br />
"Now nay, my liege, be not in such speede,<br />
For alacke I can neither write, ne reade."<br />
<br />
"Four nobles a weeke, then, I will give thee,<br />
For this merry jest thou hast showne unto me;<br />
And tell the old abbot, when thou comest home,<br />
Thou hast brought him a pardon from good King John."<br />

<h2>SECTION VIII. REALISTIC STORIES</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p><i>Origin.</i> The history of realistic stories for children may well begin with the
interest in juvenile education awakened by the great French teacher and author
Rousseau (1712-1778). He taught that formal methods should be discarded in
juvenile education and that children should be taught to know the things about
them. The new method of education is illustrated, probably unintentionally, in
<i>The Renowned History of Little Goody Two-Shoes</i>, the first selection in this section.
Rousseau directly influenced the thought of such writers as Thomas Day, Maria
Edgeworth, Dr. Aiken, and Mrs. Barbauld. The stories produced by these authors
in the last quarter of the eighteenth century are among the first written primarily
for the purpose of entertaining children. To these writers we are indebted for the
creation of types of children's literature that modern authors have developed into
the fascinating stories of child life, the thrilling stories of adventure, and the interesting
accounts of nature that now abound in libraries and book stores.</p>

<p><i>The didactic period.</i> When we read these first stories written for the entertainment
of children, we can hardly fail to observe that each one presents a lesson, either
moral or practical. The didactic purpose is so prominent that the term "Didactic
Period" may be applied to the period from 1765 (the publication of <i>Goody Two-Shoes</i>)
to 1825, or even later. The small amount of writing for children before this
period was practically all for the purpose of moral or religious instruction; hence it
was but natural for these first writers of juvenile entertainment stories to feel it
their duty to present moral and practical lessons. It would be a mistake, however,
to assume that these quaint old stories would not be interesting to children today,
for they deal with fundamental truths, which are new and interesting to children
of all ages.</p>

<p>In addition to the writers already mentioned, and represented by selections
in the following pages, there were several others whose books are yet accessible and
now and then read for their historical interest if not for any intrinsic literary value
they may possess. One of these was Mrs. Sarah K. Trimmer (1741-1810), who,
associated with the early days of the Sunday-school movement, wrote many books
full of the overwrought piety which was supposed to be necessary for children of
that earlier time. One of her books, <i>The History of the Robins</i>, stands out from the
mass for its strong appeal of simple incident, and is still widely popular with very
young readers. Hannah More (1745-1833) occupied a prominent place in the
thought of her day as a teacher of religious and social ideas among the poorer classes.
Her <i>Repository Tracts</i>, many of them in the form of stories, were devoted to making
the poor contented with their lot through the consolations of a pious life. "The
Shepherd of Salisbury Plain" was the most famous of these story-tracts, and there
are still many people living whose childhood was fed upon this and like stories.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
Mrs. Sherwood's <i>History of the Fairchild Family</i> has never been out of print since
the date of its first publication (1818), and in recent years has had two or three
sumptuous revivals at the hands of editors and publishers. The almost innumerable
books of Jacob Abbott and S. G. Goodrich ("Peter Parley") in America belong to
this didactic movement. They were, however, more devoted to the process of instilling
a knowledge of all the wonders of this great world round about us, and were considerably
less pietistic than their English neighbors. <i>The Rollo Books</i> (24 vols.)
are typical of this school.</p>

<p><i>The modern period.</i> Charles Lamb apparently was one of the first to get the
modern thought that literature for children should be just as artistic, just as dignified
in its presentation of truth, and just as worthy of literary recognition, as literature
for adults. In the hundred years since Lamb advanced his theory, students have
gradually come to recognize the fact that good literature for children is also good
literature for adults because art is art, whatever its form. In this connection, Lamb's
feeling about the necessity for making children's books more vital found expression
in a famous and much-quoted passage in a letter to Coleridge:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Goody Two-Shoes</i> is almost out of print. Mrs. Barbauld's stuff has banished all the
old classics of the nursery; and the shopman at Newbery's hardly deigned to reach them off
an old exploded corner of a shelf, when Mary asked for them. Mrs. B.'s and Mrs. Trimmer's
nonsense lay in piles about. Knowledge insignificant and vapid as Mrs. Barbauld's
books convey, it seems must come to a child in the <i>shape of knowledge</i>, and his empty noodle
must be turned with conceit of his own powers when he has learnt that a horse is an animal,
and Billy is better than a horse, and such like; instead of that beautiful interest in wild tales,
which made the child a man, while all the while he suspected himself to be no bigger than a
child. Science has succeeded to poetry no less in the little walks of children than with men.
Is there no possibility of averting this sore evil? Think what you would have been now,
if, instead of being fed with tales and old wives' fables in childhood, you had been crammed
with geography and natural history!"</p></div>

<p>The danger Lamb saw was averted. The bibliography on a preceding page
indicates that about the middle of the nineteenth century many writers of first-rate
literary ability began to write for young people. Among the number were
Harriet Martineau, Captain Marryat, Charlotte M. Yonge, Thomas Hughes, and
others. As we pass toward the end of that century and the beginning of the twentieth,
the great names associated with juvenile classics are very noticeable, and with
Miss Alcott, Mrs. Ewing, "Mark Twain," Stevenson, Kipling, Masefield, and a
kindred host, childhood has come into its own.</p>


<h3><br />SUGGESTIONS FOR READING</h3>

in the General Bibliography (<a href="#Page_17">p. 17</a>, II, "Historical Development.")</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_378" id="Note_378">378</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Among those authors of the past whom the
present still regards affectionately, Oliver
Goldsmith (1728-1774) holds a high place.
At least five of his works&mdash;a novel, a poem,
a play, a book of essays, a nursery story&mdash;rank
as classics. He had many faults; he
was vain, improvident almost beyond belief,
certainly dissipated throughout a part of
his life. But with all these faults he had
the saving grace of humor, a kind heart
that led him to share even his last penny
with one in need, a genius for friendships
that united him with such men as Burke
and Johnson and Reynolds. Always "hard
up," he wrote much as a publisher's "hack"
in order merely to live. It was in this
capacity that he probably wrote the famous
story that follows&mdash;a story that stands
at the beginning of the long and constantly
broadening current of modern literature for
children. While it has generally been
attributed to Goldsmith, no positive evidence
of his authorship has been discovered.
It was published at a time when he was in
the employ of John Newbery, the London
publisher, who issued many books for
children. We know that Goldsmith helped
with the <i>Mother Goose's Melody</i> and other
projects of Newbery, and there are many
reasons for supposing that the general
attribution of <i>Goody Two-Shoes</i> to him may
be correct. Charles Welsh, who edited the
best recent edition for schools, says it "will
always deserve a place among the classics
of childhood for its literary merit, the purity
and loftiness of its tone, and its sound
sense, while the whimsical, confidential,
affectionate style which the author employs,
makes it attractive even to children who
have long since passed the spelling-book
stage." The version that follows has been
shortened by the omission of passages that
have less importance for the modern child
than they may have had for that of the
eighteenth century. The story is thus
rendered more compact, and contains
nothing to draw attention away from the
fine qualities mentioned above. The quaint
phrasing of the title, in itself one of the
proofs of Goldsmith's authorship, furnishes
a good comment on the meaning of the
story: "The history of little Goody Two-Shoes/otherwise
called Mrs. Margery Two-Shoes/the
means by which she acquired
her learning and wisdom, and in consequence
thereof her estate; set forth at
large for the benefit of those/</div>

<div class='poem'>
Who from a state of Rags and Care,<br />
And having Shoes but half a Pair;<br />
Their Fortune and their fame would fix,<br />
And gallop in a Coach and Six."<br />
</div>

<div class='hang1'><br />[For the benefit of those who may overlook
the point, it may be explained that "Mrs."
was formerly used as a term of dignified
courtesy applied to both married and
unmarried women.]</div>


<h4><br />THE RENOWNED HISTORY OF
LITTLE GOODY TWO-SHOES</h4>

<div class='center'>ASCRIBED TO OLIVER GOLDSMITH</div>

<p>All the world must allow that Two-Shoes
was not her real name. No; her
father's name was Meanwell, and he
was for many years a considerable
farmer in the parish where Margery
was born; but by the misfortunes which
he met with in business, and the wicked
persecutions of Sir Timothy Gripe, and
an overgrown farmer called Graspall,
he was effectually ruined. These men
turned the farmer, his wife, Little Margery,
and her brother out of doors,
without any of the necessaries of life
to support them.</p>

<p>Care and discontent shortened the
days of Little Margery's father. He
was seized with a violent fever, and
died miserably. Margery's poor mother
survived the loss of her husband but a
few days, and died of a broken heart,
leaving Margery and her little brother
to the wide world. It would have
excited your pity and done your heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
good to have seen how fond these two
little ones were of each other, and how,
hand in hand, they trotted about.</p>

<p>They were both very ragged, and
Tommy had no shoes, and Margery had
but one. They had nothing, poor things,
to support them but what they picked
from the hedges or got from the poor
people, and they lay every night in a
barn. Their relatives took no notice of
them; no, they were rich, and ashamed
to own such a poor little ragged girl as
Margery and such a dirty little curl-pated
boy as Tommy. But such wicked
folks, who love nothing but money and
are proud and despise the poor, never
come to any good in the end, as we
shall see by and by.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was a very worthy clergyman
who lived in the parish where Little
Margery and Tommy were born; and
having a relative come to see him, he
sent for these children. The gentleman
ordered Little Margery a new pair of
shoes, gave Mr. Smith some money
to buy her clothes, and said he would
take Tommy and make him a little
sailor.</p>

<p>The parting between these two little
children was very affecting. Tommy
cried, and Margery cried, and they
kissed each other an hundred times.
At last Tommy wiped off her tears
with the end of his jacket, and bid her
cry no more, for he would come to her
again when he returned from sea.</p>

<p>As soon as Little Margery got up the
next morning, which was very early,
she ran all round the village, crying for
her brother; and after some time returned
greatly distressed. However, at this
instant, the shoemaker came in with
the new shoes, for which she had been
measured by the gentleman's order.</p>

<p>Nothing could have supported Little
Margery under the affliction she was
in for the loss of her brother but the
pleasure she took in her two shoes.
She ran out to Mrs. Smith as soon as
they were put on, and, stroking down
her ragged apron, cried out, "Two
shoes, mamma, see, two shoes!"</p>

<p>And she so behaved to all the people
she met, and by that means obtained
the name of Goody Two-Shoes, though
her playmates called her Old Goody
Two-Shoes.</p>

<p>Little Margery was very happy in
being with Mr. and Mrs. Smith, who were
very charitable and good to her, and had
agreed to breed her up with their family.
But at last they were obliged to send her
away, for the people who had ruined her
father commanded them to do this, and
could at any time have ruined them.</p>

<p>Little Margery saw how good and
how wise Mr. Smith was, and concluded
that this was owing to his great learning;
therefore she wanted, of all things,
to learn to read. For this purpose she
used to meet the little boys and girls
as they came from school, borrow their
books, and sit down and read till they
returned. By this means she soon got
more learning than any of her playmates,
and laid the following scheme for instructing
those who were more ignorant than
herself. She found that only the following
letters were required to spell all the
words in the world; but as some of these
letters are large and some small, she
with her knife cut out of several pieces
of wood ten sets of each of these:</p>

<div class='center'>
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>And six sets of these:</div>

<div class='center'>
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z<br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>And having got an old spelling-book, she
made her companions set up all the
words they wanted to spell, and after
that she taught them to compose sentences.
You know what a sentence is,
my dear. <i>I will be good</i>, is a sentence;
and is made up, as you see, of several
words.</div>

<p>Every morning she used to go round
to teach the children, with these rattletraps
in a basket. I once went her
rounds with her. It was about seven
o'clock in the morning when we set out
on this important business, and the first
house we came to was Farmer Wilson's.
Here Margery stopped, and ran up to
the door, tap, tap, tap.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Only little Goody Two-Shoes," answered
Margery, "come to teach Billy."</p>

<p>"Oh! little Goody," said Mrs. Wilson,
with pleasure in her face, "I am glad
to see you. Billy wants you sadly, for
he has learned all his lesson."</p>

<p>Then out came the little boy. "How
do, Doody Two-Shoes," said he, not able
to speak plain. Yet this little boy had
learned all his letters; for she threw
down this alphabet mixed together thus:</p>

<div class='center'>
b d f h k m o q s u w y z a c e g i l n p r t v x j<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and he picked them up, called them by
their right names, and put them all in
order thus:</div>

<div class='center'>
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.<br />
</div>

<p>The next place we came to was Farmer
Simpson's. "Bow, bow, bow," said the
dog at the door.</p>

<p>"Sirrah," said his mistress, "why do
you bark at Little Two-Shoes? Come
in, Madge; here, Sally wants you sadly;
she has learned all her lesson."</p>

<p>Then out came the little one.</p>

<p>"So, Madge!" says she.</p>

<p>"So, Sally!" answered the other.
"Have you learned your lesson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I have," replied
the little one in the country manner;
and immediately taking the letters she
set up these syllables:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="syllables">
<tr><td align='left'>ba be bi bo bu,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>ca ce ci co cu,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>da de di do du,</td><td align='left'>fa fe fi fo fu,</td></tr>
</table></div>

<div class='unindent'>and gave them their exact sounds as she
composed them.</div>

<p>After this, Little Two-Shoes taught
her to spell words of one syllable, and
she soon set up pear, plum, top, ball,
pin, puss, dog, hog, fawn, buck, doe,
lamb, sheep, ram, cow, bull, cock, hen,
and many more.</p>

<p>The next place we came to was Gaffer
Cook's cottage. Here a number of poor
children were met to learn. They all
came round Little Margery at once;
and, having pulled out her letters, she
asked the little boy next her what he
had for dinner. He answered, "Bread."
(The poor children in many places live
very hard.) "Well, then," said she,
"set the first letter."</p>

<p>He put up the letter <i>B</i>, to which
the next added <i>r</i>, and the next <i>e</i>, the
next <i>a</i>, the next <i>d</i> and it stood thus,
"<i>Bread</i>".</p>

<p>"And what had you, Polly Comb, for
your dinner?" "Apple-pie," answered
the little girl: upon which the next in
turn set up a great <i>A</i>, the two next a <i>p</i>
each, and so on until the two words
<i>Apple</i> and <i>pie</i> were united and stood
thus, "<i>Apple-pie</i>."</p>

<p>The next had Potatoes, the next Beef
and Turnips, which were spelt, with
many others, until the game of spelling
was finished. She then set them another
task, and we went on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>The next place we came to was Farmer
Thompson's, where there were a great
many little ones waiting for her.</p>

<p>"So, little Mrs. Goody Two-Shoes,"
said one of them. "Where have you
been so long?"</p>

<p>"I have been teaching," says she,
"longer than I intended, and am afraid
I am come too soon for you now."</p>

<p>"No, but indeed you are not," replied
the other, "for I have got my lesson,
and so has Sally Dawson, and so has
Harry Wilson, and so have we all"; and
they capered about as if they were overjoyed
to see her.</p>

<p>"Why, then," says she, "you are all
very good, and God Almighty will love
you; so let us begin our lesson."</p>

<p>They all huddled round her, and
though at the other place they were
employed about words and syllables, here
we had people of much greater understanding,
who dealt only in sentences.</p>

<p><i>The Lord have mercy upon me, and grant
I may always be good, and say my prayers, and
love the Lord my God with all my heart, and
with all my soul, and with all my strength;
and honor government and all good men in
authority.</i></p>

<p>Little Margery then set them to
compose the following:</p>


<div class='center'><br />LESSON FOR THE CONDUCT OF LIFE<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
He that will thrive<br />
Must rise by five.<br />
<br />
He that hath thriv'n<br />
May lie till seven.<br />
<br />
Truth may be blamed,<br />
But cannot be shamed.<br />
<br />
Tell me with whom you go,<br />
And I'll tell what you do.<br />
<br />

<br />
They ne'er can be wise<br />
Who good counsel despise.<br />
</div>

<p>As we were returning home, we saw
a gentleman, who was very ill, sitting
under a shady tree at the corner of his
rookery. Though ill, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'be'">he</ins> began to joke
with Little Margery, and said laughing,
"So, Goody Two-Shoes! They tell me
you are a cunning little baggage; pray,
can you tell me what I shall do to get
well?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "go to bed when
your rooks do and get up with them in
the morning; earn, as they do, every
day what you eat, and eat and drink
no more than you earn, and you will
get health and keep it."</p>

<p>The gentleman, laughing, gave Margery
sixpence, and told her she was a
sensible hussy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams, who kept a college
for instructing little gentlemen and
ladies in the science of A, B, C, was at
this time very old and infirm, and wanted
to decline that important trust. This
being told to Sir William Dove, who
lived in the parish, he sent for Mrs.
Williams, and desired she would examine
Little Two-Shoes and see whether she
was qualified for the office.</p>

<p>This was done, and Mrs. Williams
made the following report in her favor;
namely, that Little Margery was the
best scholar, and had the best head and
the best heart of any one she had examined.
All the country had a great
opinion of Mrs. Williams, and her words
gave them also a great opinion of Mrs.
Margery, for so we must now call her.</p>

<p>No sooner was Mrs. Margery settled
in this office than she laid every possible
scheme to promote the welfare and happiness
of all her neighbors, and especially
of the little ones, in whom she took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
great delight; and all those whose
parents could not afford to pay for their
education, she taught for nothing but
the pleasure she had in their company;
for you are to observe that they were
very good, or were soon made so by her
good management.</p>

<p>The school where she taught was that
which was before kept by Mrs. Williams.
The room was large, and as she knew
that nature intended children should be
always in action, she placed her different
letters, or alphabets, all round the
school, so that every one was obliged
to get up to fetch a letter or spell a
word when it came to his turn; which
not only kept them in health but fixed
the letters and points firmly in their
minds.</p>

<p>She had the following assistants to
help her, and I will tell you how she
came by them. One day as she was
going through the next village she met
with some wicked boys who had got a
young raven, which they were going to
throw at; she wanted to get the poor
creature out of their cruel hands, and
therefore gave them a penny for him,
and brought him home. She called his
name Ralph, and a fine bird he was.</p>

<p>Some days after she had met with
the raven, as she was walking in the
fields she saw some naughty boys who
had taken a pigeon and tied a string
to its leg, in order to let it fly and draw
it back again when they pleased; and
by this means they tortured the poor
animal with the hopes of liberty and
repeated disappointment. This pigeon
she also bought. He was a very pretty
fellow, and she called him Tom.</p>

<p>Some time after this a poor lamb had
lost its dam, and the farmer being about
to kill it, she bought it of him and
brought it home with her to play with
the children and teach them when to
go to bed: for it was a rule with the
wise men of that age (and a very good
one, let me tell you) to</p>

<p><i>Rise with the lark and lie down with the
lamb.</i></p>

<p>This lamb she called Will, and a pretty
fellow he was.</p>

<p>Soon after this a present was made to
Mrs. Margery of a little dog, Jumper, and
a pretty dog he was. Jumper, Jumper,
Jumper! He was always in good humor
and playing and jumping about, and
therefore he was called Jumper. The
place assigned for Jumper was that of
keeping the door, so that he may be
called the porter of the college, for he
would let nobody go out or any one
come in without the leave of his mistress.</p>

<p>But one day a dreadful accident happened
in the school. It was on a Thursday
morning, I very well remember,
when the children having learned their
lessons soon, she had given them leave
to play, and they were all running about
the school and diverting themselves with
the birds and the lamb. At this time
the dog, all of a sudden, laid hold of his
mistress's apron and endeavored to pull
her out of the school. She was at first
surprised; however, she followed him to
see what he intended.</p>

<p>No sooner had he led her into the
garden than he ran back and pulled
out one of the children in the same
manner; upon which she ordered them
all to leave the school immediately; and
they had not been out five minutes before
the top of the house fell in. What a
miraculous deliverance was here! How
gracious! How good was God Almighty,
to save all these children from destruction,
and to make use of such an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
instrument as a little sagacious animal
to accomplish His divine will! I should
have observed that as soon as they were
all in the garden, the dog came leaping
round them to express his joy, and when
the house had fallen, laid himself down
quietly by his mistress.</p>

<p>Some of the neighbors, who saw the
school fall and who were in great pain
for Margery and the little ones, soon
spread the news through the village, and
all the parents, terrified for their children,
came crowding in abundance; they
had, however, the satisfaction to find
them all safe, and upon their knees, with
their mistress, giving God thanks for
their happy deliverance.</p>

<p>You are not to wonder, my dear
reader, that this little dog should have
more sense than you, or your father, or
your grandfather.</p>

<p>Though God Almighty has made man
the lord of creation, and endowed him
with reason, yet in many respects He
has been altogether as bountiful to other
creatures of His forming. Some of the
senses of other animals are more acute
than ours, as we find by daily experience.</p>

<p>The downfall of the school was a great
misfortune to Mrs. Margery; for she
not only lost all her books, but was
destitute of a place to teach in. Sir
William Dove, being informed of this,
ordered the house to be built at his own
expense, and till that could be done,
Farmer Grove was so kind as to let her
have his large hall to teach in.</p>

<p>While at Mr. Grove's, which was in
the heart of the village, she not only
taught the children in the daytime, but
the farmer's servants, and all the neighbors,
to read and write in the evening.
This gave not only Mr. Grove but all
the neighbors a high opinion of her good
sense and prudent behavior; and she
was so much esteemed that most of the
differences in the parish were left to her
decision.</p>

<p>One gentleman in particular, I mean
Sir Charles Jones, had conceived such a
high opinion of her that he offered her a
considerable sum to take care of his
family and the education of his daughter,
which, however, she refused. But this
gentleman, sending for her afterwards
when he had a dangerous fit of illness,
she went and behaved so prudently in
the family and so tenderly to him and
his daughter that he would not permit
her to leave his house, but soon after
made her proposals of marriage. She was
truly sensible of the honor he intended
her, but, though poor, she would not
consent to be made a lady until he had
effectually provided for his daughter.</p>

<p>All things being settled and the day
fixed, the neighbors came in crowds to
see the wedding; for they were all glad
that one who had been such a good little
girl, and was become such a virtuous
and good woman, was going to be made
a lady. But just as the clergyman had
opened his book, a gentleman richly
dressed, ran into the church, and cried,
"Stop! stop!"</p>

<p>This greatly alarmed the congregation,
particularly the intended bride and
bridegroom, whom he first accosted and
desired to speak with them apart. After
they had been talking some little time,
the people were greatly surprised to see
Sir Charles stand motionless and his
bride cry and faint away in the stranger's
arms. This seeming grief, however, was
only a prelude to a flood of joy which
immediately succeeded; for you must
know, gentle reader, that this gentleman,
so richly dressed and bedizened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
with lace, was that identical little boy
whom you before saw in the sailor's
habit; in short, it was little Tom Two-Shoes,
Mrs. Margery's brother, who had
just come from beyond sea, where he
had made a large fortune. Hearing, as
soon as he landed, of his sister's intended
wedding, he had ridden in haste to see
that a proper settlement was made on
her; which he thought she was now
entitled to, as he himself was both able
and willing to give her an ample fortune.
They soon returned to their places and
were married in tears, but they were
tears of joy.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_379" id="Note_379">379</a></h3>

<div class="hang1"><i>Evenings at Home</i>, one of the important books
in the history of the development of literature
for children, was published in six
small volumes, from 1792 to 1796. It was
a result of a newly awakened interest in
the real world round about us and represented
the profound reaction against the
"fantastic visions" and "sweetmeats" of
popular literature. The main purpose was
to give instruction by showing things as
they really are. The plan of the book is
very simple. The Fairbornes, with a large
"progeny of children, boys and girls," kept
a sort of open house for friends and relatives.
Many of these visitors, accustomed
to writing, would frequently produce a
fable, a story, or a dialogue, adapted to the
age and understanding of the young people.
These papers were dropped into a box until
the children should all be assembled at
holidays. Then one of the youngest was
sent to "rummage the budget," which
meant to reach into the box and take the
paper that he happened to touch. It was
brought in and read and considered; then
the process was repeated. "Eyes, and No
Eyes" was drawn out on the twentieth
evening. <i>Evenings at Home</i> was written by
Dr. John Aikin (1747-1822) and his sister
Mrs. Anna Letitia Barbauld (1743-1825).
Dr. Aikin seems to have written the
larger number of the hundred papers
composing the book. Mrs. Barbauld's
share is placed at fifteen papers by authority
of the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>.
Some of the children in these stories may
perceive more closely than normal children
do, but this defect may add a charm if the
reader keeps in mind that this is one of the
earliest nature books for children. Stories
of this kind require the presence of some
omniscient or "encyclopedic" character to
whom all the things requiring an answer
may be referred. Mr. Andrews in "Eyes,
and No Eyes," Mr. Barlow in Day's <i>Sandford
and Merton</i>, and Mr. Gresham in Miss
Edgeworth's "Waste Not, Want Not" are
good illustrations of this type.</div>


<h4><br />
EYES, AND NO EYES<br />
OR<br />
THE ART OF SEEING<br />
</h4>

<div class='center'>DR. AIKIN AND MRS. BARBAULD</div>

<p>"Well, Robert, whither have you been
walking this afternoon?" said Mr. Andrews
to one of his pupils at the close of
a holiday.</p>

<p>R. I have been, sir, to Broom-heath,
and so round by the windmill upon
Camp-mount, and home through the
meadows by the river side.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Well, that's a pleasant round.</p>

<p>R. I thought it very dull, sir; I
scarcely met with a single person. I had
rather by half have gone along the turnpike-road.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Why, if seeing men and
horses were your object, you would,
indeed, have been better entertained on
the high-road. But did you see William?</p>

<p>R. We set out together, but he lagged
behind in the lane, so I walked on and
left him.</p>

<p>Mr. A. That was a pity. He would
have been company for you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>R. Oh, he is so tedious, always stopping
to look at this thing and that! I had
rather walk alone. I dare say he has not
got home yet.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Here he comes. Well, William,
where have you been?</p>

<p>W. Oh, sir, the pleasantest walk! I
went all over Broom-heath, and so up to
the mill at the top of the hill, and then
down among the green meadows, by the
side of the river.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Why, that is just the round
Robert has been taking, and he complains
of its dullness, and prefers the
high-road.</p>

<p>W. I wonder at that. I am sure I
hardly took a step that did not delight
me, and I have brought home my handkerchief
full of curiosities.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Suppose, then, you give us
some account of what amused you so
much. I fancy it will be as new to Robert
as to me.</p>

<p>W. I will, sir. The lane leading to the
heath, you know, is close and sandy; so I
did not mind it much, but made the best
of my way. However, I spied a curious
thing enough in the hedge. It was an
old crab-tree, out of which grew a great
bunch of something green, quite different
from the tree itself. Here is a branch of it.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Ah! this is mistletoe, a plant
of great fame for the use made of it by
the Druids of old in their religious rites
and incantations. It bears a very slimy
white berry, of which birdlime may be
made, whence its Latin name of Viscus.
It is one of those plants which do not
grow in the ground by a root of their own,
but fix themselves upon other plants;
whence they have been humorously
styled <i>parasitical</i>, as being hangers-on, or
dependents. It was the mistletoe of the
oak that the Druids particularly honored.</p>

<p>W. A little further on, I saw a green
woodpecker fly to a tree, and run up the
trunk like a cat.</p>

<p>Mr. A. That was to seek for insects
in the bark, on which they live. They
bore holes with their strong bills for that
purpose, and do much damage to the
trees by it.</p>

<p>W. What beautiful birds they are!</p>

<p>Mr. A. Yes; the woodpecker has been
called, from its color and size, the English
parrot.</p>

<p>W. When I got upon the open heath,
how charming it was! The air seemed
so fresh, and the prospect on every side
so free and unbounded! Then it was all
covered with gay flowers, many of which
I had never observed before. There
were, at least, three kinds of heath (I have
got them in my handkerchief here), and
gorse, and broom, and bell-flower, and
many others of all colors that I will beg
you presently to tell me the names of.</p>

<p>Mr. A. That I will, readily.</p>

<p>W. I saw, too, several birds that were
new to me. There was a pretty greyish
one, of the size of a lark, that was hopping
about some great stones; and when he
flew, he showed a great deal of white
about his tail.</p>

<p>Mr. A. That was a wheat-ear. They
are reckoned very delicious birds to
eat, and frequent the open downs in
Sussex, and some other counties, in great
numbers.</p>

<p>W. There was a flock of lapwings
upon a marshy part of the heath, that
amused me much. As I came near them,
some of them kept flying round and
round, just over my head, and crying
<i>pewet</i>, so distinctly, one might almost
fancy they spoke. I thought I should
have caught one of them, for he flew as
though one of his wings was broken, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
often tumbled close to the ground; but as
I came near, he always made a shift to
get away.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Ha, ha! you were finely taken
in then! This was all an artifice of the
bird's, to entice you away from its nest;
for they build upon the bare ground, and
their nests would easily be observed, did
they not draw off the attention of intruders
by their loud cries and counterfeit
lameness.</p>

<p>W. I wish I had known that, for he
led me a long chase, often over-shoes in
water. However, it was the cause of my
falling in with an old man and a boy
who were cutting and piling up turf for
fuel, and I had a good deal of talk with
them about the manner of preparing the
turf, and the price it sells at. They
gave me, too, a creature I never saw before&mdash;a
young viper, which they had just
killed, together with its dam. I have
seen several common snakes, but this is
thicker in proportion, and of a darker
color than they are.</p>

<p>Mr. A. True. Vipers frequent those
turfy, boggy grounds pretty much; and I
have known several turf-cutters bitten
by them.</p>

<p>W. They are very venomous, are they
not?</p>

<p>Mr. A. Enough so to make their
wounds painful and dangerous, though
they seldom prove fatal.</p>

<p>W. Well&mdash;I then took my course
up to the windmill, on the mount. I
climbed up the steps of the mill, in order
to get a better view of the country
around. What an extensive prospect!
I counted fifteen church-steeples; and I
saw several gentlemen's houses peeping
out from the midst of green woods and
plantations; and I could trace the windings
of the river all along the low grounds,
till it was lost behind a ridge of hills.
But I'll tell you what I mean to do, sir,
if you will give me leave.</p>

<p>Mr. A. What is that?</p>

<p>W. I will go again, and take with me
the county map, by which I shall probably
be able to make out most of the
places.</p>

<p>Mr. A. You shall have it, and I will
go with you, and take my pocket spying-glass.</p>

<p>W. I shall be very glad of that.
Well&mdash;a thought struck me, that as the
hill is called Camp-mount, there might
probably be some remains of ditches and
mounds, with which I have read that
camps were surrounded. And I really
believe I discovered something of that
sort running round one side of the
mound.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Very likely you might. I
know antiquaries have described such
remains as existing there, which some
suppose to be Roman, others Danish.
We will examine them further, when we
go.</p>

<p>W. From the hill, I went straight
down to the meadows below, and walked
on the side of a brook that runs into the
river. It was all bordered with reeds
and flags, and tall flowering plants, quite
different from those I had seen on the
heath. As I was getting down the bank,
to reach one of them, I heard something
plunge into the water near me. It was a
large water-rat, and I saw it swim over
to the other side, and go into its hole.
There were a great many large dragonflies
all about the stream. I caught one
of the finest, and have got him here in a
leaf. But how I longed to catch a bird
that I saw hovering over the water, and
that every now and then darted down
into it! It was all over a mixture of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
most beautiful green and blue, with some
orange-color. It was somewhat less
than a thrush, and had a large head and
bill, and a short tail.</p>

<p>Mr. A. I can tell you what that bird
was&mdash;a kingfisher, the celebrated halcyon
of the ancients, about which so many
tales are told. It lives on fish, which it
catches in the manner you saw. It
builds in holes in the banks, and is a shy,
retired bird, never to be seen far from the
stream which it inhabits.</p>

<p>W. I must try to get another sight of
him, for I never saw a bird that pleased
me so much. Well&mdash;I followed this little
brook till it entered the river, and then
took the path that runs along the bank.
On the opposite side, I observed several
little birds running along the shore, and
making a piping noise. They were brown
and white, and about as big as a snipe.</p>

<p>Mr. A. I suppose they were sandpipers,
one of the numerous family of
birds that get their living by wading
among the shallows, and picking up
worms and insects.</p>

<p>W. There were a great many swallows,
too, sporting upon the surface of
the water, that entertained me with their
motions. Sometimes they dashed into
the stream; sometimes they pursued one
another so quickly that the eye could
scarcely follow them. In one place,
where a high, steep sand-bank rose directly
above the river, I observed many
of them go in and out of holes, with which
the bank was bored full.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Those were sand-martins, the
smallest of our species of swallows.
They are of a mouse-color above, and
white beneath. They make their nests
and bring up their young in these holes,
which run a great depth, and by their
situation are secure from all plunderers.</p>

<p>W. A little further, I saw a man in a
boat, who was catching eels in an odd
way. He had a long pole with broad
iron prongs at the end, just like Neptune's
trident, only there were five,
instead of three. This he pushed
straight down among the mud, in the
deepest parts of the river, and fetched
up the eels sticking between the prongs.</p>

<p>Mr. A. I have seen this method. It
is called spearing of eels.</p>

<p>W. While I was looking at him, a
heron came flying over my head, with
his large, flagging wings. He alighted
at the next turn of the river, and I crept
softly behind the bank to watch his
motions. He had waded into the water
as far as his long legs would carry him,
and was standing with his neck drawn
in, looking intently on the stream.
Presently, he darted his long bill, as quick
as lightning, into the water, and drew
out a fish, which he swallowed. I saw
him catch another in the same manner.
He then took alarm at some noise I
made, and flew away slowly to a wood at
some distance, where he settled.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Probably his nest was there,
for herons build upon the loftiest trees
they can find, and sometimes in society
together, like rooks. Formerly, when
these birds were valued for the amusement
of hawking, many gentlemen had
their <i>heronries</i>, and a few are still remaining.</p>

<p>W. I think they are the largest wild
birds we have.</p>

<p>Mr. A. They are of great length and
spread of wing, but their bodies are comparatively
small.</p>

<p>W. I then turned homeward, across
the meadows, where I stopped awhile
to look at a large flock of starlings, which
kept flying about at no great distance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
I could not tell at first what to make
of them; for they arose all together from
the ground as thick as a swarm of bees,
and formed themselves into a sort of
black cloud, hovering over the field.
After taking a short round, they settled
again, and presently arose again in the
same manner. I dare say there were
hundreds of them.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Perhaps so; for in the fenny
countries their flocks are so numerous as
to break down whole acres of reeds by
settling on them. This disposition of
starlings to fly in close swarms was
remarked even by Homer, who compares
the foe flying from one of his heroes,
to a <i>cloud</i> of <i>stares</i> retiring dismayed at
the approach of the hawk.</p>

<p>W. After I had left the meadows, I
crossed the corn-fields in the way to our
house, and passed close by a deep marlpit.
Looking into it, I saw in one of the
sides a cluster of what I took to be shells;
and, upon going down, I picked up a
clod of marl, which was quite full of
them; but how sea-shells could get there,
I cannot imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. A. I do not wonder at your surprise,
since many philosophers have
been much perplexed to account for the
same appearance. It is not uncommon
to find great quantities of shells and
relics of marine animals even in the bowels
of high mountains, very remote from the
sea. They are certainly proofs that the
earth was once in a very different state
from what it is at present; but in what
manner, and how long ago these changes
took place, can only be guessed at.</p>

<p>W. I got to the high field next
our house just as the sun was setting,
and I stood looking at it till it was
quite lost. What a glorious sight! The
clouds were tinged purple and crimson
and yellow of all shades and hues, and
the clear sky varied from blue to a fine
green at the horizon. But how large the
sun appears just as it sets! I think it
seems twice as big as when it is overhead.</p>

<p>Mr. A. It does so; and you may
probably have observed the same apparent
enlargement of the moon at its
rising?</p>

<p>W. I have; but, pray, what is the
reason of this?</p>

<p>Mr. A. It is an optical deception,
depending upon principles which I cannot
well explain to you till you know
more of that branch of science. But
what a number of new ideas this afternoon's
walk has afforded you! I do
not wonder that you found it amusing;
it has been very instructive, too. Did
<i>you</i> see nothing of all these sights,
Robert?</p>

<p>R. I saw some of them, but I did
not take particular notice of them.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Why not?</p>

<p>R. I don't know. I did not care
about them, and I made the best of my
way home.</p>

<p>Mr. A. That would have been right
if you had been sent with a message;
but as you walked only for amusement,
it would have been wiser to have sought
out as many sources of it as possible.
But so it is&mdash;one man walks through
the world with his eyes open, and another
with them shut; and upon this difference
depends all the superiority of knowledge
the one acquires above the other.
I have known sailors who had been in
all the quarters of the world, and could
tell you nothing but the signs of the
tippling-houses they frequented in different
ports, and the price and quality
of the liquor. On the other hand, a
Franklin could not cross the Channel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
without making some observations useful
to mankind. While many a vacant,
thoughtless youth is whirled throughout
Europe without gaining a single idea
worth crossing a street for, the observing
eye and inquiring mind find matter
of improvement and delight in every
ramble in town or country. Do <i>you</i>,
then, William, continue to make use of
your eyes; and <i>you</i>, Robert, learn that
eyes were given you to use.</p>

<div class="hang1">Thomas Day's <i>History of Sandford and
Merton</i> was published in three volumes,
1783-1789. Day died in the latter year
at the early age of forty-one. He was a
"benevolent eccentric." Since he was
well to do he could devote himself to the
attempt to carry out the schemes of social
reform which he had at heart. Influenced
by Rousseau and the doctrines of the
French Revolution, he believed human
nature could be made over by an educational
scheme. <i>Sandford and Merton</i> is
an elaborate setting forth of the concrete
workings of this process. The inculcation
of greater sympathy for the lower classes
and for animals, and a return to the natural,
commonplace virtues as opposed to the
artificial organization of society formed
the main burden of the book. Tommy
Merton, six-year-old spoiled darling of an
over-indulgent gentleman of great fortune,
and Harry Sandford, wonderfully perfect
son of a "plain, honest farmer," are placed
under the tuition of a minister-philosopher,
named Barlow. This philosopher is evidently
Mr. Day's fictitious portrayal of
himself. The story given below is one of
a number by means of which the "encyclopedic"
Barlow educates Tommy and
Harry. Another story from this group,
"Androcles and the Lion," may be found
in the fables (No. <a href="#Note_214">214</a>). <i>Sandford and
Merton</i> is still, according to Sir Leslie
Stephen, "among the best children's books
in the language, in spite of its quaint
didacticism, because it succeeds in forcibly
expressing his [Day's] high sense of manliness,
independence, and sterling qualities
of character."</div>


<h4><br />THE GOOD-NATURED
LITTLE BOY</h4>

<div class='center'>THOMAS DAY</div>

<p>A little Boy went out, one morning,
to walk to a village about five miles
from the place where he lived, and
carried with him, in a basket, the provision
that was to serve him the whole
day. As he was walking along, a poor
little half-starved dog came up to him,
wagging his tail, and seeming to entreat
him to take compassion on him. The
little Boy at first took no notice of him,
but at length, remarking how lean and
famished the creature seemed to be, he
said, "This animal is certainly in very
great necessity: if I give him part of
my provision, I shall be obliged to go
home hungry myself; however, as he
seems to want it more than I do, he
shall partake with me." Saying this,
he gave the dog part of what he had in
the basket, who ate as if he had not
tasted victuals for a fortnight.</p>

<p>The little Boy then went on a little
farther, his dog still following him, and
fawning upon him with the greatest
gratitude and affection; when he saw a
poor old horse lying upon the ground,
and groaning as if he was very ill, he went
up to him, and saw that he was almost
starved, and so weak that he was unable
to rise. "I am very much afraid," said
the little Boy, "if I stay to assist this
horse, that it will be dark before I can
return; and I have heard that there are
several thieves in the neighborhood;
however, I will try; it is doing a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
action to attempt to relieve him; and
God Almighty will take care of me."
He then went and gathered some grass,
which he brought to the horse's mouth,
who immediately began to eat with as
much relish as if his chief disease was
hunger. He then fetched some water
in his hat, which the animal drank up,
and seemed immediately to be so much
refreshed, that, after a few trials, he
got up, and began grazing.</p>

<p>The little Boy then went on a little
farther, and saw a man wading about in
a pond of water, without being able to
get out of it, in spite of all his endeavors.
"What is the matter, good man,"
said the little Boy to him; "can't you
find your way out of this pond?" "No,
God bless you, my worthy master, or
miss," said the man; "for such I take
you to be by your voice: I have fallen
into this pond, and know not how to
get out again, as I am quite blind, and
I am almost afraid to move for fear of
being drowned." "Well," said the little
Boy, "though I shall be wetted to the
skin, if you will throw me your stick, I
will try to help you out of it." The
blind man then threw the stick to that
side on which he heard the voice; the
little Boy caught it, and went into the
water, feeling very carefully before him,
lest he should unguardedly go beyond
his depth; at length he reached the blind
man, took him very carefully by the
hand, and led him out. The blind man
then gave him a thousand blessings,
and told him he could grope out his
way home; and the little Boy ran on
as hard as he could, to prevent being
benighted.</p>

<p>But he had not proceeded far, before
he saw a poor Sailor who had lost both
his legs in an engagement by sea, hopping
along upon crutches. "God bless
you, my little master!" said the Sailor;
"I have fought many a battle with the
French, to defend poor old England: but
now I am crippled, as you see, and have
neither victuals nor money, although I
am almost famished." The little Boy
could not resist his inclination to relieve
him; so he gave him all his remaining
victuals, and said, "God help you, poor
man! This is all I have, otherwise you
should have more." He then ran along,
and presently arrived at the town he
was going to, did his business, and
returned towards his own home with
all the expedition he was able.</p>

<p>But he had not gone much more than
half way, before the night shut in
extremely dark, without either moon
or stars to light him. The poor little
Boy used his utmost endeavors to find
his way, but unfortunately missed it in
turning down a lane which brought him
into a wood, where he wandered about
a great while without being able to find
any path to lead him out. Tired out
at last, and hungry, he felt himself so
feeble that he could go no farther, but
set himself down upon the ground, crying
most bitterly. In this situation he
remained for some time, till at last the
little dog, who had never forsaken him,
came up to him, wagging his tail, and
holding something in his mouth. The
little Boy took it from him, and saw
it was a handkerchief nicely pinned
together, which somebody had dropped
and the dog had picked up; and on opening
it, he found several slices of bread
and meat, which the little Boy ate with
great satisfaction, and, felt himself
extremely refreshed with his meal. "So,"
said the little Boy, "I see that if I have
given you a breakfast, you have given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
me a supper; and a good turn is never
lost, done even to a dog."</p>

<p>He then once more attempted to
escape from the wood; but it was to no
purpose; he only scratched his legs with
briars, and slipped down in the dirt,
without being able to find his way out.
He was just going to give up all farther
attempts in despair, when he happened
to see a horse feeding before him, and,
going up to him, saw by the light of
the moon, which just then began to
shine a little, that it was the very same
he had fed in the morning. "Perhaps,"
said the little Boy, "this creature, as I
have been so good to him, will let me
get upon his back, and he may bring
me out of the wood, as he is accustomed
to feed in this neighborhood." The
little Boy then went up to the horse,
speaking to him and stroking him, and
the horse let him mount his back without
opposition; and then proceeded
slowly through the wood, grazing as he
went, till he brought him to an opening
which led to the high road. The little
Boy was much rejoiced at this, and said,
"If I had not saved this creature's life
in the morning, I should have been
obliged to have staid here all night; I
see by this that a good turn is never
lost."</p>

<p>But the poor little Boy had yet a
greater danger to undergo; for, as he
was going along a solitary lane, two men
rushed out upon him, laid hold of him,
and were going to strip him of his clothes;
but, just as they were beginning to do it,
the little dog bit the leg of one of the
men with so much violence that he
left the little Boy and pursued the dog,
that ran howling and barking away. In
this instant a voice was heard that cried
out, "There the rascals are; let us
knock them down!" which frightened the
remaining man so much that he ran
away, and his companion followed him.
The little Boy then looked up, and saw
that it was the Sailor, whom he had
relieved in the morning, carried upon
the shoulders of the blind man whom
he had helped out of the pond. "There,
my little dear," said the Sailor, "God
be thanked! We have come in time to
do you a service, in return for what you
did us in the morning. As I lay under
a hedge I heard these villains talk of
robbing a little Boy, who, from the
description, I concluded must be you:
but I was so lame that I should not
have been able to come time enough
to help you, if I had not met this honest
blind man, who took me upon his back
while I showed him the way."</p>

<p>The little Boy thanked him very
sincerely for thus defending him; and
they went all together to his father's
house, which was not far off; where
they were all kindly entertained with a
supper and a bed. The little Boy took
care of his faithful dog as long as he
lived, and never forgot the importance
and necessity of doing good to others,
if we wish them to do the same to us.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_381" id="Note_381">381</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">It has been no unusual thing for critics and
others following in their wake to sneer at
Maria Edgeworth (1767-1849) and her
school as hopelessly utilitarian. But to
find fault with her on that score is to blame
her for having achieved the very end she
set out to reach. Sir Walter Scott, who
certainly knew what good story-telling
was, had the highest opinion of her abilities,
and it is difficult to see how any reader
with a fair amount of catholicity in his
nature can fail to be impressed with her
power to build up a story in skillful dramatic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
fashion, to portray various types of character
in most convincing manner, and to
emphasize in unforgettable ways the old
and basic verities of life. Of course fashions
change in outward matters, and we must
not quarrel with a taste that prefers the
newest in literature any more than with
one that prefers the newest in dress. Miss
Edgeworth helped her eccentric father
present in <i>Practical Education</i> an extended
discussion for the layman of the whole
question of the ways and means of educating
people. That was one of the very first
modern treatments of that much-discussed
subject, and its ideas are not all obsolete
yet by any means. <i>Castle Rackrent</i> belongs
in the list of classic fiction. However, her
chief interest for this collection rests in the
most important of her books for children,
<i>The Parent's Assistant or, Stories for
Children</i> (1796-1800). The forbidding
primary title was something the publisher
was mainly responsible for, and has been
relegated to second place in modern reprints.
In these stories, according to the
preface, "only such situations are described
as children can easily imagine, and which
may consequently interest their feelings.
Such examples of virtue are painted as are
not above their conceptions of excellence,
and their powers of sympathy and emulation."
Miss Edgeworth knew children
thoroughly. She was surrounded by a
crowd of brothers and sisters for whom she
had to invent means of entertainment as
well as instruction. They really collaborated
in the making of the stories. As
the stories were written out on a slate, the
sections were read to eager listeners, and
the author had the advantage of their honest
expressions of approval or dissent. "Waste
Not, Want Not" first appeared in the final
form given to <i>The Parent's Assistant</i>, the
third edition published in six volumes in
1800. It is perhaps the best to represent
Miss Edgeworth's work, though "Simple
Susan," "Lazy Lawrence," and others have
their admirers. In judging her work the
student should keep in mind (1) that she
wrote at a time when, unlike the present,
the best authors thought it beneath their
dignity to write for children, (2) that the
too repressive and dogmatic attitude
towards children which one now and then
feels in her stories was due to a conscious
effort to offset the undisciplined enthusiasms
and sentimentalisms of her day, and
(3) that she has been a living influence in
the lives of countless men and women for
over a century. She was a real pioneer.</div>


<h4><br />
WASTE NOT, WANT NOT<br />
OR<br />
TWO STRINGS TO YOUR BOW<br />
</h4>

<div class='center'>MARIA EDGEWORTH</div>

<p>Mr. Gresham, a Bristol merchant,
who had by honorable industry and
economy accumulated a considerable
fortune, retired from business to a new
house which he had built upon the
Downs, near Clifton. Mr. Gresham,
however, did not imagine that a new
house alone could make him happy: he
did not purpose to live in idleness and
extravagance, for such a life would have
been equally incompatible with his habits
and his principles. He was fond of
children, and as he had no sons, he determined
to adopt one of his relations. He
had two nephews, and he invited both
of them to his house, that he might
have an opportunity of judging of their
dispositions, and of the habits which
they had acquired.</p>

<p>Hal and Benjamin, Mr. Gresham's
nephews, were about ten years old;
they had been educated very differently.
Hal was the son of the elder branch
of the family; his father was a gentleman,
who spent rather more than he
could afford; and Hal, from the example
of the servants in his father's family,
with whom he had passed the first years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
of his childhood, learned to waste more
of everything than he used. He had
been told that "gentlemen should be
above being careful and saving"; and
he had unfortunately imbibed a notion
that extravagance is the sign of a generous,
and economy of an avaricious
disposition.</p>

<p>Benjamin, on the contrary, had been
taught habits of care and foresight: his
father had but a very small fortune, and
was anxious that his son should early
learn that economy insures independence,
and sometimes puts it in the power
of those who are not very rich, to be
very generous.</p>

<p>The morning after these two boys
arrived at their uncle's, they were
eager to see all the rooms in the house.
Mr. Gresham accompanied them, and
attended to their remarks, and exclamations.</p>

<p>"Oh! what an excellent motto!" exclaimed
Ben, when he read the following
words which were written in large
characters over the chimneypiece, in
his uncle's spacious kitchen:</p>

<div class='center'>
WASTE NOT, WANT NOT<br />
</div>

<p>"Waste not, want not!" repeated his
cousin Hal, in rather a contemptuous
tone; "I think it looks stingy to servants;
and no gentleman's servants,
cooks especially, would like to have
such a mean motto always staring them
in the face."</p>

<p>Ben, who was not so conversant as
his cousin in the ways of cooks and
gentleman's servants, made no reply to
these observations.</p>

<p>Mr. Gresham was called away while
his nephews were looking at the other
rooms in the house. Some time afterwards,
he heard their voices in the hall.</p>

<p>"Boys," said he, "what are you doing
there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Sir," said Hal; "you were
called away from us, and we did not
know which way to go."</p>

<p>"And have you nothing to do?" said
Mr. Gresham.</p>

<p>"No, Sir, nothing," answered Hal, in a
careless tone, like one who was well content
with the state of habitual idleness.</p>

<p>"No, Sir, nothing!" replied Ben, in a
voice of lamentation.</p>

<p>"Come," said Mr. Gresham, "if you
have nothing to do, lads, will you
unpack these two parcels for me?"</p>

<p>The two parcels were exactly alike,
both of them well tied up with good
whipcord. Ben took his parcel to a
table, and, after breaking off the sealing
wax, began carefully to examine the
knot, and then to untie it. Hal stood
still exactly in the spot where the parcel
was put into his hands, and tried first
at one corner, and then at another, to
pull the string off by force: "I wish these
people wouldn't tie up their parcels so
tight, as if they were never to be undone,"
cried he, as he tugged at the cord; and
he pulled the knot closer instead of
loosening it.</p>

<p>"Ben! why how did you get yours
undone, man? What's in your parcel?
I wonder what is in mine! I wish I
could get this string off&mdash;I must cut it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Ben, who now had undone
the last knot of his parcel, and who drew
out the length of string with exultation,
"don't cut it, Hal&mdash;look what a nice
cord this is, and yours is the same; it's
a pity to cut it; '<i>Waste not, want not!</i>'
you know."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Hal, "what signifies a
bit of pack-thread?"</p>

<p>"It is whipcord," said Ben.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, whipcord! What signifies a
bit of whipcord! You can get a bit of
whipcord twice as long as that for twopence;
and who cares for twopence!
Not I, for one! So here it goes," cried
Hal, drawing out his knife; and he cut
the cord, precipitately, in sundry places.</p>

<p>"Lads! Have you undone the parcels
for me?" said Mr. Gresham, opening
the parlor door as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," cried Hal; and he dragged
off his half-cut, half-entangled string&mdash;"here's
the parcel."</p>

<p>"And here's my parcel, Uncle; and
here's the string," said Ben.</p>

<p>"You may keep the string for your
pains," said Mr. Gresham.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sir," said Ben: "what
an excellent whipcord it is!"</p>

<p>"And you, Hal," continued Mr.
Gresham, "you may keep your string
too, if it will be of any use to you."</p>

<p>"It will be of no use to me, thank you,
Sir," said Hal.</p>

<p>"No, I am afraid not, if this be it,"
said his uncle taking up the jagged,
knotted remains of Hal's cord.</p>

<p>A few days after this, Mr. Gresham
gave to each of his nephews a new top.</p>

<p>"But how's this?" said Hal; "these
tops have no strings; what shall we do
for strings?"</p>

<p>"I have a string that will do very well
for mine," said Ben; and he pulled out
of his pocket the fine long smooth string
which had tied up the parcel. With this
he soon set up his top, which spun
admirably well.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I wish that I had but a
string!" said Hal: "what shall I do for
a string? I'll tell you what: I can use
the string that goes round my hat."</p>

<p>"But then," said Ben, "what will you
do for a hatband?"</p>

<p>"I'll manage to do without one,"
said Hal and he took the string off
his hat for his top. It soon was worn
through; and he split his top by driving
the peg too tightly into it. His
cousin Ben let him set up his the next
day; but Hal was not more fortunate
or more careful when he meddled with
other people's things than when he
managed his own. He had scarcely
played half an hour before he split it,
by driving in the peg too violently.</p>

<p>Ben bore this misfortune with good
humor. "Come," said he, "it can't be
helped! But give me the string, because
<i>that</i> may still be of use for something
else."</p>

<p>It happened some time afterwards,
that a lady who had been intimately
acquainted with Hal's mother at Bath,
that is to say, who had frequently
met her at the card table during the
winter, now arrived at Clifton. She
was informed by his mother that Hal
was at Mr. Gresham's: and her sons,
who were <i>friends</i> of his, came to see
him, and invited him to spend the next
day with them.</p>

<p>Hal joyfully accepted the invitation.
He was always glad to go out to dine,
because it gave him something to do,
something to think of, or, at least,
something to say. Besides this, he had
been educated to think it was a fine
thing to visit fine people; and Lady
Diana Sweepstakes (for that was the
name of his mother's acquaintance) was
a very fine lady; and her two sons
intended to be very <i>great</i> gentlemen.</p>

<p>He was in a prodigious hurry when
these young gentlemen knocked at his
uncle's door the next day; but just as
he got to the hall door, little Patty called
to him from the top of the stairs, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
told him that he had dropped his pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Pick it up, then, and bring it to me,
quick, can't you, child," cried Hal,
"for Lady Di.'s sons are waiting for me?"</p>

<p>Little Patty did not know anything
about Lady Di.'s sons; but as she was
very good-natured, and saw that her
cousin Hal was, for some reason or
other, in a desperate hurry, she ran down
stairs as fast as she possibly could towards
the landing-place, where the handkerchief
lay:&mdash;but alas! Before she reached
the handkerchief she fell, rolling down
a whole flight of stairs; and, when her
fall was at last stopped by the landing-place,
she did not cry, but she writhed
as if she was in great pain.</p>

<p>"Where are you hurt, my love?" said
Mr. Gresham, who came instantly, on
hearing the noise of some one falling
down stairs.</p>

<p>"Where are you hurt, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Here, Papa," said the little girl,
touching her ankle, which she had
decently covered with her gown: "I
believe I am hurt here, but not much,"
added she, trying to rise; "only it hurts
me when I move."</p>

<p>"I'll carry you, don't move then,"
said her father; and he took her up in
his arms.</p>

<p>"My shoe, I've lost one of my shoes,"
said she. Ben looked for it upon the
stairs, and he found it sticking in a loop
of whipcord, which was entangled round
one of the balusters. When this cord
was drawn forth, it appeared that it
was the very same jagged, entangled
piece which Hal had pulled off his parcel.
He had diverted himself with running
up and down stairs, whipping the balusters
with it, as he thought he could
convert it to no better use; and with his
usual carelessness, he at last left it hanging
just where he happened to throw it,
when the dinner-bell rang. Poor little
Patty's ankle was terribly sprained, and
Hal reproached himself for his folly, and
would have reproached himself longer,
perhaps, if Lady Di. Sweepstakes' sons
had not hurried him away.</p>

<p>In the evening, Patty could not run
about as she used to do; but she sat
upon the sofa, and she said that "she
did not feel the pain of her ankle so
<i>much</i> whilst Ben was so good as to play
at <i>jack-straws</i> with her."</p>

<p>"That's right, Ben; never be ashamed
of being good-natured to those who are
younger and weaker than yourself," said
his uncle, smiling at seeing him produce
his whipcord, to indulge his little cousin
with a game at her favorite cat's-cradle.
"I shall not think you one bit less manly,
because I see you playing at cat's-cradle
with a child six years old."</p>

<p>Hal, however, was not precisely of his
uncle's opinion; for when he returned in
the evening and saw Ben playing with
his little cousin, he could not help smiling
contemptuously, and asked if he
had been playing at cat's-cradle all
night. In a heedless manner he made
some inquiries after Patty's sprained
ankle, and then he ran on to tell all the
news he had heard at Lady Diana
Sweepstakes'&mdash;news which he thought
would make him appear a person of vast
importance.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Uncle&mdash;Do you know,
Ben," said he&mdash;"there's to be the most
<i>famous</i> doings that ever were heard of,
upon the Downs here, the first day of
next month, which will be in a fortnight,
thank my stars! I wish the fortnight
were over; I shall think of nothing else
I know, till that happy day comes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gresham inquired why the first
of September was to be so much happier
than any other day in the year.</p>

<p>"Why," replied Hal, "Lady Diana
Sweepstakes, you know, is a <i>famous</i> rider,
and archer, and <i>all that</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Mr. Gresham,
soberly&mdash;"but what then?"</p>

<p>"Dear Uncle!" cried Hal, "but you
shall hear. There's to be a race upon
the Downs the first of September, and,
after the race, there's to be an archery
meeting for the ladies, and Lady Diana
Sweepstakes is to be one of <i>them</i>. And
after the ladies have done shooting&mdash;now,
Ben, comes the best part of it! we
boys are to have our turn, and Lady Di.
is to give a prize to the best marksman
amongst us, of a very handsome bow and
arrow! Do you know I've been practising
already, and I'll show you tomorrow,
as soon as it comes home, the
<i>famous</i> bow and arrow that Lady Diana
has given me: but, perhaps," added he,
with a scornful laugh, "you like a cat's-cradle
better than a bow and arrow."</p>

<p>Ben made no reply to this taunt at the
moment; but the next day, when Hal's
new bow and arrow came home, he convinced
him that he knew how to use it
very well.</p>

<p>"Ben," said his uncle, "you seem to
be a good marksman, though you have
not boasted of yourself. I'll give you a
bow and arrow; and perhaps, if you
practise, you may make yourself an
archer before the first of September; and,
in the meantime, you will not wish the
fortnight to be over, for you will have
something to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir," interrupted Hal, "but if you
mean that Ben should put in for the prize,
he must have a uniform."</p>

<p>"Why <i>must</i> he?" said Mr. Gresham.</p>

<p>"Why, Sir, because everybody has&mdash;I
mean everybody that's anybody;&mdash;and
Lady Diana was talking about the
uniform all dinner-time, and it's settled
all about it except the buttons; the
young Sweepstakes are to get theirs
made first for patterns; they are to be
white, faced with green; and they'll look
very handsome, I'm sure; and I shall
write to Mamma to-night, as Lady Diana
bid me, about mine; and I shall tell her
to be sure to answer my letter, without
fail, by return of the post; and then, if
Mamma makes no objection, which I
know she won't, because she never thinks
much about expense, and <i>all that</i>&mdash;then
I shall bespeak my uniform, and get it
made by the same tailor that makes for
Lady Diana and the young Sweepstakes."</p>

<p>"Mercy upon us!" said Mr. Gresham,
who was almost stunned by the rapid
vociferation with which this long speech
about a uniform was pronounced.</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to understand these
things," added he, with an air of simplicity,
"but we will inquire, Ben, into
the necessity of the case, and if it is
necessary&mdash;or if you think it necessary&mdash;that
you should have a uniform, why&mdash;I'll
give you one."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>, Uncle!&mdash;Will you, <i>indeed?</i>"
exclaimed Hal, with amazement painted
in his countenance. "Well, that's the
last thing in the world I should have
expected!&mdash;You are not at all the sort
of person I should have thought would
care about a uniform; and I should have
supposed you'd have thought it extravagant
to have a coat on purpose only for
one day; and I'm sure Lady Diana Sweepstakes
thought as I do: for when I told
her that motto over your kitchen chimney,
WASTE NOT, WANT NOT, she
laughed, and said that I had better not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
talk to you about uniforms, and that
my mother was the proper person to
write to about my uniform; but I'll tell
Lady Diana, Uncle, how good you are,
and how much she was mistaken."</p>

<p>"Take care how you do that," said
Mr. Gresham; "for, perhaps, the lady
was not mistaken."</p>

<p>"Nay, did not you say, just now, you
would give poor Ben a uniform?"</p>

<p>"I said I would, if he thought it necessary
to have one."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll answer for it, he'll think it
necessary," said Hal, laughing, "because
it is necessary."</p>

<p>"Allow him, at least, to judge for
himself," said Mr. Gresham.</p>

<p>"My dear Uncle, but I assure you,"
said Hal, earnestly, "there's no judging
about the matter, because really, upon
my word, Lady Diana said distinctly
that her sons were to have uniforms,
white faced with green, and a green and
white cockade in their hats."</p>

<p>"May be so," said Mr. Gresham, still
with the same look of calm simplicity;
"put on your hats, boys, and come with
me. I know a gentleman whose sons
are to be at this archery meeting, and we
will inquire into all the particulars from
him. Then, after we have seen him (it
is not eleven o'clock yet), we shall have
time enough to walk on to Bristol and
choose the cloth for Ben's uniform, if
it be necessary."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell what to make of all he
says," whispered Hal, as he reached down
his hat; "do you think, Ben, he means to
give you this uniform, or not?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Ben, "that he means
to give me one, if it be necessary; or, as
he said, if I think it is necessary."</p>

<p>"And that, to be sure, you will; won't
you? or else you'll be a great fool, I
know, after all I've told you. How can
any one in the world know so much
about the matter as I, who have dined
with Lady Diana Sweepstakes but yesterday;
and heard all about it, from
beginning to end? And as for this gentleman
that we are going to, I'm sure, if
he knows anything about the matter,
he'll say exactly the same as I do."</p>

<p>"We shall hear," said Ben, with a
degree of composure, which Hal could
by no means comprehend, when a uniform
was in question.</p>

<p>The gentleman upon whom Mr. Gresham
called had three sons, who were all
to be at this archery meeting, and they
unanimously assured him, in the presence
of Hal and Ben, that they had never
thought of buying uniforms for this
grand occasion; and that amongst the
number of their acquaintance, they knew
of but three boys whose friends intended
to be at such <i>an unnecessary</i> expense.
Hal stood amazed&mdash;"Such are the
varieties of opinion upon all the grand
affairs of life," said Mr. Gresham, looking
at his nephews&mdash;"what amongst
one set of people you hear asserted to be
absolutely necessary, you will hear from
another set of people is quite unnecessary.
All that can be done, my dear boys, in
these difficult cases, is to judge for yourselves,
which opinions, and which people,
are the most reasonable."</p>

<p>Hal, who had been more accustomed to
think of what was fashionable than of
what was reasonable, without at all considering
the good sense of what his uncle
said to him, replied with childish petulance,
"Indeed, sir, I don't know what
other people think; I only know what
Lady Diana Sweepstakes said."</p>

<p>The name of Lady Diana Sweepstakes,
Hal thought, must impress all present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
with respect: he was highly astonished,
when, as he looked round, he saw a smile
of contempt upon every one's countenance;
and he was yet further bewildered
when he heard her spoken of as a very
silly, extravagant, ridiculous woman,
whose opinion no prudent person would
ask upon any subject, and whose example
was to be shunned, instead of being
imitated.</p>

<p>"Ay, my dear Hal," said his uncle,
smiling at his look of amazement, "these
are some of the things that young people
must learn from experience. All the
world do not agree in opinion about
characters: you will hear the same person
admired in one company, and blamed in
another; so that we must still come round
to the same point, <i>Judge for yourself</i>."</p>

<p>Hal's thoughts were, however, at
present, too full of the uniform to allow
his judgment to act with perfect impartiality.
As soon as their visit was over,
and all the time they walked down
the hill from Prince's-buildings, towards
Bristol, he continued to repeat nearly
the same arguments which he had
formerly used; respecting necessity, the
uniform, and Lady Diana Sweepstakes.</p>

<p>To all this Mr. Gresham made no reply;
and longer had the young gentleman
expatiated upon the subject, which had
so strongly seized upon his imagination,
had not his senses been forcibly assailed
at this instant by the delicious odors
and tempting sight of certain cakes and
jellies in a pastry-cook's shop.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle," said he, as his uncle was
going to turn the corner to pursue the
road to Bristol, "look at those jellies!"
pointing to a confectioner's shop; "I
must buy some of those good things;
for I have got some half-pence in my
pocket."</p>

<p>"Your having half-pence in your pocket
is an excellent reason for eating," said
Mr. Gresham, smiling.</p>

<p>"But I really am hungry," said Hal;
"you know, Uncle, it is a good while
since breakfast."</p>

<p>His uncle, who was desirous to see his
nephews act without restraint, that he
might judge of their characters, bid
them do as they pleased.</p>

<p>"Come, then, Ben, if you've any half-pence
in your pocket."</p>

<p>"I'm not hungry," said Ben.</p>

<p>"I suppose <i>that</i> means that you've no
half-pence," said Hal, laughing, with the
look of superiority which he had been
taught to think <i>the rich</i> might assume
towards those who were convicted either
of poverty or economy.</p>

<p>"Waste not, want not," said Ben to
himself. Contrary to his cousin's surmise,
he happened to have two pennyworth
of half-pence actually in his pocket.</p>

<p>At the very moment Hal stepped into
the pastry-cook's shop, a poor industrious
man, with a wooden leg, who usually
sweeps the dirty corner of the walk which
turns at this spot to the Wells, held his hat
to Ben, who, after glancing his eye at the
petitioner's well-worn broom, instantly
produced his two-pence. "I wish I had
more half-pence for you, my good man,"
said he; "but I've only two-pence."</p>

<p>Hal came out of Mr. Millar's, the
confectioner's shop, with a hatful of cakes
in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Millar's dog was sitting on the
flags before the door; and he looked up,
with a wistful, begging eye, at Hal, who
was eating a queen-cake.</p>

<p>Hal, who was wasteful even in his
good nature, threw a whole queen-cake
to the dog, who swallowed it for a single
mouthful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>"There go two-pence in the form of a
queen-cake," said Mr. Gresham.</p>

<p>Hal next offered some of his cakes to
his uncle and cousin; but they thanked
him, and refused to eat any, because,
they said, they were not hungry; so he
ate and ate, as he walked along, till at
last he stopped, and said, "This bun
tastes so bad after the queen-cakes, I
can't bear it!" and he was going to fling
it from him into the river.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is a pity to waste that good
bun; we may be glad of it yet," said Ben;
"give it to me, rather than throw it
away."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you said you were
not hungry," said Hal.</p>

<p>"True, I am not hungry now; but
that is no reason why I should never be
hungry again."</p>

<p>"Well, there is the cake for you; take
it, for it has made me sick; and I don't
care what becomes of it."</p>

<p>Ben folded the refuse bit of his cousin's
bun in a piece of paper, and put it into
his pocket.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to be exceedingly
tired, or sick, or something," said Hal,
"and as there is a stand of coaches somewhere
hereabouts, had we not better
take a coach, instead of walking all the
way to Bristol?"</p>

<p>"For a stout archer," said Mr. Gresham,
"you are more easily tired than one
might have expected. However, with
all my heart; let us take a coach; for
Ben asked me to show him the cathedral
yesterday, and I believe I should find it
rather too much for me to walk so far,
though I am not sick with eating good
things."</p>

<p>"<i>The cathedral!</i>" said Hal, after he
had been seated in the coach about a
quarter of an hour, and had somewhat
recovered from his sickness. "The cathedral!
Why, are we only going to Bristol
to see the cathedral? I thought we
came out to see about a uniform."</p>

<p>There was a dullness and melancholy
kind of stupidity in Hal's countenance,
as he pronounced these words, like one
wakening from a dream, which made both
his uncle and cousin burst out a laughing.</p>

<p>"Why," said Hal, who was now piqued,
"I'm sure you <i>did</i> say, Uncle, you would
go to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s, to choose the cloth
for the uniform."</p>

<p>"Very true: and so I will," said Mr.
Gresham; "but we need not make a
whole morning's work, need we, of looking
at a piece of cloth? Cannot we see
a uniform and a cathedral both in one
morning?"</p>

<p>They went first to the cathedral.
Hal's head was too full of the uniform
to take any notice of the painted window,
which immediately caught Ben's unembarrassed
attention. He looked at the
large stained figures on the Gothic
window; and he observed their colored
shadows on the floor and walls.</p>

<p>Mr. Gresham, who perceived that he
was eager on all subjects to gain information,
took this opportunity of telling
him several things about the lost art of
painting on glass, Gothic arches, etc.,
which Hal thought extremely tiresome.</p>

<p>"Come! come! we shall be late,
indeed," said Hal; "surely you've looked
long enough, Ben, at this blue and red
window."</p>

<p>"I'm only thinking about these colored
shadows," said Ben.</p>

<p>"I can show you, when we go home,
Ben," said his uncle, "an entertaining
paper on such shadows."</p>

<p>"Hark!" cried Ben, "did you hear
that noise?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>They all listened, and heard a bird
singing in the cathedral.</p>

<p>"It's our old robin, sir," said the lad
who had opened the cathedral door for
them.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Gresham, "there he
is, boys&mdash;look&mdash;perched upon the organ;
he often sits there, and sings whilst the
organ is playing." "And," continued
the lad who showed the cathedral, "he
has lived here this many winters; they
say he is fifteen years old; and he is so
tame, poor fellow, that if I had a bit of
bread he'd come down and feed in my
hand."</p>

<p>"I've a bit of bun here," cried Ben,
joyfully, producing the remains of the
bun which Hal, but an hour before,
would have thrown away. "Pray let us
see the poor robin eat out of your hand."</p>

<p>The lad crumbled the bun, and called
to the robin, who fluttered and chirped,
and seemed rejoiced at the sight of the
bread; but yet he did not come down
from his pinnacle on the organ.</p>

<p>"He is afraid of <i>us</i>," said Ben; "he
is not used to eat before strangers, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, Sir," said the young man,
with a deep sigh, "that is not the thing:
he is used enough to eat afore company;
time was, he'd have come down for me,
before ever so many fine folks, and have
ate his crumbs out of my hand, at my
first call; but, poor fellow, it's not his
fault now; he does not know me now,
Sir, since my accident, because of this
great black patch."</p>

<p>The young man put his hand to his
right eye, which was covered with a
huge black patch.</p>

<p>Ben asked what <i>accident</i> he meant;
and the lad told him that, a few weeks
ago, he had lost the sight of his eye by
the stroke of a stone, which reached
him as he was passing under the rocks
of Clifton, unluckily, when the workmen
were blasting.</p>

<p>"I don't mind so much for myself,
Sir," said the lad; "but I can't work
so well now, as I used to do before my
accident, for my old mother, who has
had a stroke of the palsy; and I've a
many little brothers and sisters, not well
able yet to get their own livelihood,
though they be as willing, as willing can
be."</p>

<p>"Where does your mother live?" said
Mr. Gresham.</p>

<p>"Hard by, Sir, just close to the church
here: it was <i>her</i> that always had the
showing of it to strangers, till she lost
the use of her poor limbs."</p>

<p>"Shall we, may we, go that way?&mdash;This
is the house: is it not?" said Ben,
when they went out of the cathedral.</p>

<p>They went into the house: it was
rather a hovel than a house; but, poor
as it was, it was as neat as misery could
make it.</p>

<p>The old woman was sitting up in her
wretched bed, winding worsted; four
meager, ill-clothed, pale children were
all busy, some of them sticking pins in
paper for the pin-maker, and others
sorting rags for the paper-maker.</p>

<p>"What a horrid place it is!" said Hal,
sighing; "I did not know there were
such shocking places in the world. I've
often seen terrible-looking, tumble-down
places, as we drove through the town in
Mamma's carriage; but then I did not
know who lived in them; and I never
saw the inside of any of them. It is
very dreadful, indeed, to think that
people are forced to live in this way. I
wish Mamma would send me some more
pocket-money, that I might do something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
for them. I had half-a-crown; but,"
continued he, feeling in his pockets,
"I'm afraid I spent the last shilling of
it this morning, upon those cakes that
made me sick. I wish I had my shilling
now, I'd give it to <i>these poor people</i>."</p>

<p>Ben, though he was all this time
silent, was as sorry as his talkative
cousin, for all these poor people. But
there was some difference between the
sorrow of these two boys.</p>

<p>Hal, after he was again seated in the
hackney-coach, and had rattled through
the busy streets of Bristol for a few
minutes, quite forgot the spectacle of
misery which he had seen; and the gay
shops in Wine-street, and the idea of
his green and white uniform, wholly
occupied his imagination.</p>

<p>"Now for our uniforms!" cried he, as
he jumped eagerly out of the coach,
when his uncle stopped at the woolen-draper's
door.</p>

<p>"Uncle," said Ben, stopping Mr.
Gresham before he got out of the carriage,
"I don't think a uniform is at
all necessary for me. I'm very much
obliged to you, but I would rather
not have one. I have a very good
coat&mdash;and I think it would be waste."</p>

<p>"Well, let me out of the carriage and
we will see about it," said Mr. Gresham
"perhaps the sight of the beautiful
green and white cloth, and the epaulettes
(have you ever considered the epaulettes?)
may tempt you to change your
mind."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Ben, laughing; "I shall
not change my mind."</p>

<p>The green cloth, and the white cloth,
and the epaulettes, were produced, to
Hal's infinite satisfaction. His uncle
took up a pen, and calculated for a few
minutes; then, showing the back of the
letter, upon which he was writing, to his
nephews, "Cast up these sums, boys,"
said he, "and tell me whether I am right."</p>

<p>"Ben, do you do it," said Hal, a
little embarrassed; "I am not quick at
figures."</p>

<p>Ben <i>was</i>, and he went over his uncle's
calculation very expeditiously.</p>

<p>"It is right, is it?" said Mr. Gresham.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, quite right."</p>

<p>"Then by this calculation, I find I
could for less than half the money your
uniforms would cost, purchase for each
of you boys a warm great-coat, which
you will want, I have a notion, this
winter upon the Downs."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir," said Hal, with an alarmed
look; "but it is not winter <i>yet;</i> it is
not cold weather yet. We sha'n't want
great-coats <i>yet</i>."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember how cold we
were, Hal, the day before yesterday, in
that sharp wind, when we were flying
our kite upon the Downs?&mdash;and
winter will come, though it is not come
yet; I am sure, I should like to have
a good warm great-coat very much,"
said Ben.</p>

<p>Mr. Gresham took six guineas out
of his purse; and he placed three of them
before Hal, and three before Ben.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen," said he, "I
believe your uniforms would come to
about three guineas apiece. Now I
will lay out this money for you just
as you please: Hal, what say you?"</p>

<p>"Why, Sir," said Hal, "a great-coat
is a good thing, to be sure; and then,
after the great-coat, as you said it would
only cost half as much as the uniform,
there would be some money to spare,
would not there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, about five-and-twenty
shillings."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>"Five-and-twenty shillings! I could
buy and do a great many things, to be
sure, with five-and-twenty shillings; but
then, <i>the thing is</i>, I must go without the
uniform, if I have the great-coat."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said his uncle.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Hal, sighing as he looked
at the epaulettes, "Uncle, if you would
not be displeased if I choose the uniform&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall not be displeased at your
choosing whatever you like best," said
Mr. Gresham.</p>

<p>"Well, then, thank you, Sir, I think I
had better have the uniform, because
if I have not the uniform now directly
it will be of no use to me, as the archery
meeting is the week after next, you
know; and as to the great-coat, perhaps,
between this time and the <i>very</i> cold
weather, which, perhaps, won't be till
Christmas, Papa will buy a great-coat
for me; and I'll ask Mamma to give
me some pocket-money to give away,
and she will perhaps."</p>

<p>To all this conclusive conditional reasoning,
which depended upon <i>perhaps</i>,
three times repeated, Mr. Gresham made
no reply; but he immediately bought the
uniform for Hal, and desired that it should
be sent to Lady Diana Sweepstakes'
sons' tailor, to be made up. The measure
of Hal's happiness was now complete.</p>

<p>"And how am I to lay out the three
guineas for you, Ben?" said Mr. Gresham.
"Speak, what do you wish for first?"</p>

<p>"A great-coat, Uncle, if you please."</p>

<p>Mr. Gresham bought the coat; and
after it was paid for, five-and-twenty
shillings of Ben's three guineas remained.</p>

<p>"What's next, my boy?" said his
uncle.</p>

<p>"Arrows, Uncle, if you please: three
arrows."</p>

<p>"My dear, I promised you a bow and
arrows."</p>

<p>"No, Uncle, you only said a bow."</p>

<p>"Well, I meant a bow and arrows.
I'm glad you are so exact, however.
It is better to claim less than more than
what is promised. The three arrows
you shall have. But go on: how shall
I dispose of these five-and-twenty shillings
for you?"</p>

<p>"In clothes, if you will be so good,
Uncle, for that poor boy, who has the
great black patch on his eye."</p>

<p>"I always believed," said Mr. Gresham,
shaking hands with Ben, "that economy
and generosity were the best friends,
instead of being enemies, as some
silly, extravagant people would have
us think them. Choose the poor blind
boy's coat, my dear nephew, and
pay for it. There's no occasion for my
praising you about the matter; your
best reward is in your own mind, child;
and you want no other, or I'm mistaken.
Now jump into the coach, boys,
and let's be off. We shall be late, I'm
afraid," continued he, as the coach drove
on; "but I must let you stop, Ben, with
your goods, at the poor boy's door."</p>

<p>When they came to the house, Mr.
Gresham opened the coach door, and
Ben jumped out with his parcel under
his arm.</p>

<p>"Stay, stay! you must take me with
you," said his pleased uncle; "I like to
see people made happy as well as you
do."</p>

<p>"And so do I too!" said Hal; "let
me come with you. I almost wish my
uniform was not gone to the tailor's,
so I do."</p>

<p>And when he saw the look of delight
and gratitude with which the poor boy
received the clothes which Ben gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
him; and when he heard the mother
and children thank him, Hal sighed, and
said, "Well, I hope Mamma will give
me some more pocket-money soon."</p>

<p>Upon his return home, however, the
sight of the <i>famous</i> bow and arrow
which Lady Diana Sweepstakes had sent
him, recalled to his imagination all the
joys of his green and white uniform; and
he no longer wished that it had not been
sent to the tailor's.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand, cousin Hal,"
said little Patty, "why you call this bow
a <i>famous</i> bow; you say <i>famous</i> very
often; and I don't know exactly what
it means&mdash;a <i>famous</i> uniform&mdash;<i>famous</i>
doings&mdash;I remember you said there are
to be <i>famous</i> doings the first of September
upon the Downs&mdash;What does <i>famous</i>
mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, why <i>famous</i> means&mdash;Now don't
you know what <i>famous</i> means? It
means&mdash;it is a word that people say&mdash;It
is the fashion to say it. It means&mdash;it
means <i>famous</i>."</p>

<p>Patty laughed, and said, "<i>This</i> does
not explain it to me."</p>

<p>"No," said Hal, "nor can it be
explained: if you don't understand it,
that's not my fault: everybody but
little children, I suppose, understands
it; but there's no explaining <i>those sorts</i>
of words, if you don't <i>take them</i> at once.
There's to be <i>famous</i> doings upon the
Downs the first of September; that is,
grand, fine. In short, what does it
signify talking any longer, Patty, about
the matter? Give me my bow; for I
must go upon the Downs, and practise."</p>

<p>Ben accompanied him with the bow
and the three arrows which his uncle
had now given to him; and every day
these two boys went out upon the Downs,
and practised shooting with indefatigable
perseverance. Where equal pains are
taken, success is usually found to be
pretty nearly equal. Our two archers,
by constant practice, became expert
marksmen; and before the day of trial
they were so exactly matched in point
of dexterity, that it was scarcely possible
to decide which was superior.</p>

<p>The long-expected first of September
at length arrived.</p>

<p>"What sort of a day is it?" was
the first question that was asked by
Hal and Ben, the moment that they
awakened.</p>

<p>The sun shone bright; but there was
a sharp and high wind.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Ben, "I shall be glad of
my good great-coat to-day; for I've a
notion it will be rather cold upon the
Downs, especially when we are standing
still, as we must, while all the people
are shooting."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind! I don't think I
shall feel it cold at all," said Hal, as he
dressed himself in his new white and
green uniform: and he viewed himself
with much complacency.</p>

<p>"Good morning to you, Uncle; how
do you do?" said he, in a voice of exultation,
when he entered the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>How do you do? seemed rather to
mean, How do you like me in my uniform?</p>

<p>And his uncle's cool, "Very well, I
thank you, Hal," disappointed him, as
it seemed only to say, "Your uniform
makes no difference in my opinion of
you."</p>

<p>Even little Patty went on eating her
breakfast much as usual, and talked of
the pleasure of walking with her father
to the Downs, and of all the little things
which interested her; so that Hal's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
epaulettes were not the principal object
in any one's imagination but his own.</p>

<p>"Papa," said Patty, "as we go up
the hill where there is so much red mud,
I must take care to pick my way nicely;
and I must hold up my frock, as you
desired me; and perhaps you will be so
good, if I am not troublesome, to lift
me over the very bad place where there
are no stepping-stones. My ankle is
entirely well, and I'm glad of that, or
else I should not be able to walk so far
as the Downs. How good you were to
me, Ben, when I was in pain, the day I
sprained my ankle! You played at jack-straws,
and at cat's-cradle with me. Oh,
that puts me in mind&mdash;Here are your
gloves, which I asked you that night to
let me mend. I've been a great while
about them, but are not they very
neatly mended, Papa? Look at the
sewing."</p>

<p>"I am not a very good judge of sewing,
my dear little girl," said Mr.
Gresham, examining the work with a
close and scrupulous eye; "but in my
opinion, here is one stitch that is rather too
long; the white teeth are not quite even."</p>

<p>"O Papa, I'll take out that long tooth
in a minute," said Patty laughing; "I
did not think that you would have
observed it so soon."</p>

<p>"I would not have you trust to my
blindness," said her father, stroking her
head fondly: "I observe everything.
I observe, for instance, that you are a
grateful little girl, and that you are
glad to be of use to those who have been
kind to you; and for this I forgive you
the long stitch."</p>

<p>"But it's out, it's out, Papa," said
Patty; "and the next time your gloves
want mending, Ben, I'll mend them
better."</p>

<p>"They are very nice, I think," said
Ben, drawing them on; "and I am much
obliged to you. I was just wishing I
had a pair of gloves to keep my fingers
warm to-day, for I never can shoot
well when my hands are numbed. Look,
Hal&mdash;you know how ragged these gloves
were; you said they were good for nothing
but to throw away; now look, there's
not a hole in them," said he, spreading
his fingers.</p>

<p>"Now, is it not very extraordinary,"
said Hal to himself, "that they should
go on so long talking about an old pair
of gloves, without scarcely saying a word
about my new uniform? Well, the
young Sweepstakes and Lady Diana
will talk enough about it; that's one
comfort."</p>

<p>"Is not it time to think of setting out,
Sir?" said Hal to his uncle; "the company,
you know, are to meet at the
Ostrich at twelve, and the race to begin at
one, and Lady Diana's horses, I know,
were ordered to be at the door at ten."</p>

<p>Mr. Stephen, the butler, here interrupted
the hurrying young gentleman
in his calculations. "There's a poor
lad, Sir, below, with a great black patch
on his right eye, who is come from
Bristol, and wants to speak a word with
the young gentlemen, if you please. I
told him they were just going out with
you, but he says he won't detain them
above half a minute."</p>

<p>"Show him up, show him up," said
Mr. Gresham.</p>

<p>"But I suppose," said Hal, with a
sigh, "that Stephen mistook, when he
said the young <i>gentlemen;</i> he only
wants to see Ben, I dare say; I'm sure
he has no reason to want to see me."</p>

<p>"Here he comes&mdash;O Ben, he is dressed
in the new coat you gave him," whispered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
Hal, who was really a good-natured boy,
though extravagant. "How much better
he looks than he did in the ragged
coat! Ah! he looked at you first, Ben;
and well he may!"</p>

<p>The boy bowed without any cringing
servility, but with an open, decent
freedom in his manner, which expressed
that he had been obliged, but that he
knew his young benefactor was not
thinking of the obligation. He made as
little distinction as possible between his
bows to the two cousins.</p>

<p>"As I was sent with a message, by
the clerk of our parish, to Redland
Chapel, out on the Downs, to-day, Sir,"
said he to Mr. Gresham, "knowing your
house lay in my way, my mother, Sir,
bid me call, and make bold to offer the
young gentlemen two little worsted balls
that she had worked for them," continued
the lad, pulling out of his pocket
two worsted balls worked in green and
orange colored stripes: "they are but
poor things, Sir, she bid me say, to look
at; but considering she had but one hand
to work with, and <i>that</i> her left hand,
you'll not despise 'em, we hopes."</p>

<p>He held the balls to Ben and Hal.
"They are both alike, gentlemen," said
he; "if you'll be pleased to take 'em,
they are better than they look, for they
bound higher than your head; I cut
the cork round for the inside myself,
which was all I could do."</p>

<p>"They are nice balls, indeed; we are
much obliged to you," said the boys,
as they received them, and they proved
them immediately. The balls struck
the floor with a delightful sound, and
rebounded higher than Mr. Gresham's
head. Little Patty clapped her hands
joyfully; but now a thundering double
rap at the door was heard.</p>

<p>"The Master Sweepstakes, Sir," said
Stephen, "are come for Master Hal;
they say that all the young gentlemen
who have archery uniforms are to walk
together in a body, I think they say,
Sir; and they are to parade along the
Well-Walk, they desired me to say, Sir,
with a drum and fife, and so up the hill,
by Prince's Place, and all to go upon the
Downs together, to the place of meeting.
I am not sure I'm right, Sir, for both
the young gentlemen spoke at once, and
the wind is very high at the street door,
so that I could not well make out all
they said; but I believe this is the sense
of it."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Hal, eagerly, "it's
all right; I know that is just what was
settled the day I dined at Lady Diana's;
and Lady Diana and a great party of
gentlemen are to ride&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, that is nothing to the purpose,"
interrupted Mr. Gresham. "Don't keep
the Master Sweepstakes waiting; decide&mdash;do
you choose to go with them, or
with us?"</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;Uncle&mdash;Sir, you know, since
all the <i>uniforms</i> agreed to go together&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Off with you then, Mr. Uniform, if
you mean to go," said Mr. Gresham.</p>

<p>Hal ran downstairs in such a hurry
that he forgot his bow and arrows.
Ben discovered this when he went to
fetch his own; and the lad from Bristol,
who had been ordered by Mr. Gresham
to eat his breakfast before he proceeded
to Redland Chapel, heard Ben talking
about his cousin's bow and arrows.</p>

<p>"I know," said Ben, "he will be sorry
not to have his bow with him, because
here are the green knots tied to it, to
match his cockade; and he said that
the boys were all to carry their bows as
part of the show."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you'll give me leave, sir," said the
poor Bristol lad, "I shall have plenty
of time; and I'll run down to the Well-Walk
after the young gentleman, and
take him his bow and arrows."</p>

<p>"Will you? I shall be much obliged
to you," said Ben; and away went the
boy with the bow that was ornamented
with green ribands.</p>

<p>The public walk leading to the Wells
was full of company. The windows of
all the houses in St. Vincent's parade
were crowded with well-dressed ladies,
who were looking out in expectation of
the archery procession. Parties of gentlemen
and ladies, and a motley crowd of
spectators, were seen moving backwards
and forwards under the rocks, on the
opposite side of the water. A barge,
with colored streamers flying, was waiting
to take up a party, who were going
upon the water. The bargemen rested
upon their oars, and gazed with broad
faces of curiosity on the busy scene that
appeared upon the public walk.</p>

<p>The archers and archeresses were now
drawn up on the flags under the semi-circular
piazza just before Mrs. Yearsley's
library. A little band of children, who
had been mustered by Lady Diana
Sweepstakes' <i>spirited exertions</i>, closed
the procession. They were now all in
readiness. The drummer only waited
for her ladyship's signal; and the
archers' corps only waited for her ladyship's
word of command to march.</p>

<p>"Where are your bow and arrows, my
little man?" said her ladyship to Hal,
as she reviewed her Lilliputian regiment.
"You can't march, man, without your
arms!"</p>

<p>Hal had dispatched a messenger for
his forgotten bow, but the messenger
returned not; he looked from side to
side in great distress. "Oh, there's my
bow coming, I declare!" cried he; "look,
I see the bow and the ribands; look now,
between the trees, Charles Sweepstakes,
on the Hot-well Walk; it is coming."</p>

<p>"But you've kept us all waiting a
confounded time," said his impatient
friend.</p>

<p>"It is that good-natured poor fellow
from Bristol, I protest, that has brought
it to me; I'm sure I don't deserve it
from him," said Hal to himself, when he
saw the lad with the black patch on his
eye running quite out of breath towards
him with his bow and arrows.</p>

<p>"Fall back, my good friend, fall back,"
said the military lady, as soon as he had
delivered the bow to Hal: "I mean stand
out of the way, for your great patch cuts no
figure amongst us. Don't follow so close,
now, as if you belonged to us, pray."</p>

<p>The poor boy had no ambition to
partake the triumph; he <i>fell back</i> as
soon as he understood the meaning of
the lady's words. The drum beat,
the fife played, the archers marched,
the spectators admired. Hal stepped
proudly, and felt as if the eyes of the
whole universe were upon his epaulettes,
or upon the facings of his uniform;
whilst all the time he was considered
only as part of a show. The walk
appeared much shorter than usual; and
he was extremely sorry that Lady Diana,
when they were half way up the hill
leading to Prince's Place, mounted her
horse, because the road was dirty, and
all the gentlemen and ladies who accompanied
her, followed her example. "We
can leave the children to walk, you
know," said she to the gentleman who
helped her to mount her horse. "I
must call to some of them, though, and
leave orders where they are to <i>join</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>She beckoned: and Hal, who was foremost,
and proud to show his alacrity,
ran on to receive her ladyship's orders.
Now, as we have before observed, it was
a sharp and windy day; and though
Lady Diana Sweepstakes was actually
speaking to him, and looking at him,
he could not prevent his nose from wanting
to be blown; he pulled out his
handkerchief, and out rolled the new
ball, which had been given to him just
before he left home, and which, according
to his usual careless habits, he had
stuffed into his pocket in a hurry. "Oh,
my new ball!" cried he, as he ran after
it. As he stooped to pick it up, he let go
his hat, which he had hitherto held on
with anxious care; for the hat, though
it had a fine green and white cockade,
had no band or string round it. The
string, as we may recollect, our wasteful
hero had used in spinning his top. The
hat was too large for his head without
this band; a sudden gust of wind blew
it off&mdash;Lady Diana's horse started and
reared. She was a <i>famous</i> horse-woman,
and sat him to the admiration of all
beholders; but there was a puddle of
red clay and water in this spot, and her
ladyship's uniform-habit was a sufferer
by the accident.</p>

<p>"Careless brat!" said she. "Why
can't he keep his hat upon his head?"</p>

<p>In the meantime, the wind blew the
hat down the hill, and Hal ran after it,
amidst the laughter of his kind friends,
the young Sweepstakes, and the rest of
the little regiment. The hat was lodged
at length, upon a bank. Hal pursued
it: he thought this bank was hard. But,
alas! the moment he set his foot upon it,
the foot sank. He tried to draw it
back, his other foot slipped, and he
fell prostrate, in his green and white
uniform, into the treacherous bed of red
mud. His companions, who had halted
upon the top of the hill, stood laughing
spectators of his misfortune.</p>

<p>It happened that the poor boy with
the black patch upon his eye, who had
been ordered by Lady Diana to "<i>fall
back</i>" and to "<i>keep at a distance</i>," was
now coming up the hill; and the moment
he saw our fallen hero, he hastened to
his assistance. He dragged poor Hal,
who was a deplorable spectacle, out of
the red mud; the obliging mistress of a
lodging-house, as soon as she understood
that the young gentleman was nephew to
Mr. Gresham, to whom she had formerly
let her house, received Hal, covered as
he was with dirt.</p>

<p>The poor Bristol lad hastened to Mr.
Gresham's for clean stockings and shoes
for Hal. He was unwilling to give up
his uniform; it was rubbed and rubbed,
and a spot here and there was washed
out; and he kept continually repeating,
"When it's dry it will all brush off;
when it's dry it will all brush off, won't
it?" But soon the fear of being too
late at the archery meeting began to
balance the dread of appearing in his
stained habiliments; and he now as
anxiously repeated, while the woman
held the wet coat to the fire, "Oh, I shall
be too late; indeed I shall be too late;
make haste; it will never dry: hold it
nearer&mdash;nearer to the fire. I shall lose
my turn to shoot. Oh, give me the coat; I
don't mind how it is, if I can but get it on."</p>

<p>Holding it nearer and nearer to the
fire dried it quickly, to be sure, but it
shrank it also, so that it was no easy
matter to get the coat on again.</p>

<p>However, Hal, who did not see the
red splashes, which, in spite of all the
operations, were too visible upon his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
shoulders and upon the skirts of his
white coat behind, was pretty well satisfied
to observe that there was not one
spot upon the facings. "Nobody," said
he, "will take notice of my coat behind,
I dare say. I think it looks as smart
almost as ever!" and under this persuasion
our young archer resumed his
bow&mdash;his bow with green ribands now
no more! And he pursued his way to
the Downs.</p>

<p>All his companions were far out of
sight. "I suppose," said he to his
friend with the black patch, "I suppose
my uncle and Ben had left home before
you went for the shoes and stockings
for me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Sir; the butler said they had
been gone to the Downs a matter of a
good half hour or more."</p>

<p>Hal trudged on as fast as he possibly
could. When he got on the Downs, he
saw numbers of carriages, and crowds
of people, all going towards the place
of meeting, at the Ostrich. He pressed
forwards; he was at first so much
afraid of being late, that he did not take
notice of the mirth his motley appearance
excited in all beholders. At length
he reached the appointed spot. There
was a great crowd of people. In the
midst, he heard Lady Diana's loud voice
betting upon some one who was just
going to shoot at the mark.</p>

<p>"So then, the shooting is begun, is it?"
said Hal. "Oh, let me in; pray let me
into the circle! I'm one of the archers&mdash;I
am, indeed; don't you see my green
and white uniform?"</p>

<p>"Your red and white uniform, you
mean," said the man to whom he addressed
himself: and the people, as they
opened a passage for him, could not
refrain from laughing at the mixture
of dirt and finery which it exhibited.
In vain, when he got into the midst of
the formidable circle, he looked to his
friends, the young Sweepstakes, for their
countenance and support: they were
amongst the most unmerciful of the
laughers. Lady Diana also seemed more
to enjoy than to pity his confusion.</p>

<p>"Why could you not keep your hat
upon your head, man?" said she, in her
masculine tone. "You have been almost
the ruin of my poor uniform-habit; but
I've escaped rather better than you
have. Don't stand there in the middle
of the circle, or you'll have an arrow
in your eye presently, I've a notion."</p>

<p>Hal looked round in search of better
friends. "Oh, where's my uncle?&mdash;where's
Ben," said he. He was in such
confusion, that, amongst the number of
faces, he could scarcely distinguish one
from another; but he felt somebody at
this moment pull his elbow, and, to his
great relief, he heard the friendly voice,
and saw the good-natured face, of his
cousin Ben.</p>

<p>"Come back; come behind these
people," said Ben, "and put on my
great-coat; here it is for you."</p>

<p>Right glad was Hal to cover his disgraced
uniform with the rough great-coat,
which he had formerly despised.
He pulled the stained, drooping cockade
out of his unfortunate hat; and he was
now sufficiently recovered from his vexation
to give an intelligible account of
his accident to his uncle and Patty, who
anxiously inquired what had detained
him so long, and what had been the
matter. In the midst of the history of
his disaster, he was just proving to
Patty that his taking the hat-band to
spin his top had nothing to do with his
misfortune; and he was at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
time endeavoring to refute his uncle's
opinion, that the waste of the whipcord
that tied the parcel, was the original cause
of all his evils, when he was summoned to
try his skill with his <i>famous</i> bow.</p>

<p>"My hands are numbed; I can scarcely
feel," said he, rubbing them, and blowing
upon the ends of his fingers.</p>

<p>"Come, come," cried young Sweepstakes,
"I'm within one inch of the mark;
who'll go nearer, I should like to see.
Shoot away, Hal; but first, understand
our laws: we settled them before you
came on the green. You are to have
three shots, with your own bow and
your own arrows; and nobody's to
borrow or lend under pretence of other
bows being better or worse, or under
any pretence. Do you hear, Hal?"</p>

<p>This young gentleman had good reasons
for being so strict in these laws, as
he had observed that none of his companions
had such an excellent bow as
he had provided for himself. Some of
the boys had forgotten to bring more
than one arrow with them, and by his
cunning regulation, that each person
should shoot with his own arrows, many
had lost one or two of their shots.</p>

<p>"You are a lucky fellow; you have
your three arrows," said young Sweepstakes.
"Come, we can't wait whilst
you rub your fingers, man&mdash;shoot away."</p>

<p>Hal was rather surprised at the
asperity with which his friend spoke.
He little knew how easily acquaintances,
who call themselves friends, can change,
when their interest comes, in the slightest
degree, in competition with their
friendship. Hurried by his impatient
rival, and with his hand so much benumbed
that he could scarcely feel how
to fix the arrow in the string, he drew
the bow. The arrow was within a
quarter of an inch of Master Sweepstakes'
mark, which was the nearest that
had yet been hit. Hal seized his second
arrow. "If I have any luck," said he
but just as he pronounced the word <i>luck</i>
and as he bent his bow, the string broke
in two, and the bow fell from his hands.</p>

<p>"There, it's all over with you," cried
Master Sweepstakes, with a triumphant
laugh.</p>

<p>"Here's my bow for him and welcome,"
said Ben.</p>

<p>"No, no, Sir; that is not fair; that's
against the regulation. You may shoot
with your own bow, if you choose it, or
you may not, just as you think proper
but you must not lend it, Sir."</p>

<p>It was now Ben's turn to make his
trial. His first arrow was not successful.
His second was exactly as near as Hal's first.</p>

<p>"You have but one more," said Master
Sweepstakes: "now for it!"</p>

<p>Ben, before he ventured his last arrow
prudently examined the string of his
bow; and as he pulled it to try its
strength, it cracked.</p>

<p>Master Sweepstakes clapped his hands
with loud exultations, and insulting
laughter. But his laughter ceased when
our provident hero calmly drew from his
pocket an excellent piece of whipcord.</p>

<p>"The everlasting whipcord, I declare!"
exclaimed Hal, when he saw that it was
the very same that had tied up the parcel.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ben, as he fastened it to
his bow, "I put it into my pocket to-day,
on purpose, because I thought I might
happen to want it."</p>

<p>He drew his bow the third and last time.</p>

<p>"O Papa," cried little Patty, as his
arrow hit the mark, "it's the nearest,
is not it the nearest?"</p>

<p>Master Sweepstakes, with anxiety,
examined the hit. There could be no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
doubt. Ben was victorious! The bow,
the prize bow, was now delivered to
him; and Hal, as he looked at the
whipcord, exclaimed, "How <i>lucky</i> this
whipcord has been to you, Ben!"</p>

<p>"It is <i>lucky</i> perhaps you mean, that
he took care of it," said Mr. Gresham.</p>

<p>"Ay," said Hal, "very true; he might
well say, 'Waste not, want not'; it is a
good thing to have two strings to one's
bow."</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_382" id="Note_382">382</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Only a few of those who have written immediately
for children have produced work
distinguished by the same high artistic
qualities found in the work of writers for
readers of mature minds. Of these few
one is Mrs. Juliana Horatia Ewing (1841-1885).
Edmund Gosse has said that of the
numerous English authors who have written
successfully on or for children only two
"have shown a clear recollection of the
mind of healthy childhood itself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Mrs. Ewing in prose and Mr. Stevenson in
verse have sat down with them without
disturbing their fancies, and have looked
into the world of 'make-believe' with the
children's own eyes." They might lead,
he thinks, "a long romp in the attic when
nurse was out shopping, and not a child
in the house should know that a grown-up
person had been there." This is very high
praise indeed and it suggests the reason for
the immense popularity of "Jackanapes,"
"The Story of a Short Life," "Daddy
Darwin's Dovecot," "Lob-Lie-by-the-Fire,"
"Mrs. Overtheway's Remembrances," and
many another of the stories that delighted
young readers when they first appeared in
the pages of <i>Aunt Judy's Magazine</i>. The
pre&euml;minence of "Jackanapes" among these
many splendid stories may at least partly
be accounted for by the fact that it grew
out of the heat of a great conviction about
life. Early in 1879 the news reached
England of the death of the Prince Imperial
of France, who fell while serving with the
English forces in South Africa during the
war with the Zulus. Perhaps the present-day
reader needs to be reminded that the
Prince Imperial was the only son of the
ex-Empress Eugenie, who, with her husband
Napoleon III had taken refuge in
England after the loss of the French throne
at the close of the Franco-Prussian War
in 1871. Napoleon's death shortly after
made the young prince a central figure in
all considerations of the possible recouping
of the fortunes of the Napoleonic dynasty.
Full of the spirit of adventure and courage,
he had joined the English forces to learn
something of the soldier's profession.
Unexpectedly ambushed, the prince was
killed while the young officer who had
been assigned to look after him escaped
unhurt. There immediately ensued a wide
discussion of the action of this young
officer in saving himself and, apparently,
leaving the Prince to his fate. Now, Mrs.
Ewing was a soldier's wife and believed in
the standard of honor which would naturally
be reflected in military circles on such an
incident. But hearing the rule of "each
man for himself" so often emphasized in
other circles, she was moved to write the
protest against such a view which forms
the central motive in "Jackanapes." There
is no argument, however, no undue moralizing.
With the finest art she embodies
that central doctrine in a great faith that
the saving of a man's life lies in his readiness
to lose it. It was Satan who said, "Skin
for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he
give for his life." The pathos in the story
is naturally inherent in the situation and
is never emphasized for its own sake.
Mrs. Ewing was always a thoroughly
conscientious artist. She believed that
the laws of artistic composition laid down
by Ruskin in his <i>Elements of Drawing</i>
applied with equal force to literature.
"For example," says her brother in an
article on her methods, "in the story of
'Jackanapes' the law of Principality is very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
clearly demonstrated. Jackanapes is the
one important figure. The doting aunt,
the weak-kneed but faithful Tony Johnson,
the irascible general, the punctilious postman,
the loyal boy-trumpeter, the silent
major, and the ever-dear, faithful, loving
Lollo,&mdash;all and each of them conspire with
one consent to reflect forth the glory and
beauty of the noble, generous, recklessly
brave, and gently tender spirit of the hero
'Jackanapes.'" As to the laws of repetition
and contrast: "Again and again is
the village green introduced to the imagination.
It is a picture of eternal peace and
quietness, amid the tragedies of our ever-changing
life which are enacted around it."</div>

<p>Two Donkeys and the Geese lived on
the Green, and all other residents of any
social standing lived in houses round it.
The houses had no names. Everybody's
address was "The Green," but the Postman
and the people of the place knew
where each family lived. As to the rest
of the world, what has one to do with the
rest of the world when he is safe at home
on his own Goose Green? Moreover, if a
stranger did come on any lawful business,
he might ask his way at the shop. Most
of the inhabitants were long-lived, early
deaths (like that of the little Miss Jessamine)
being exceptional; and most of the
old people were proud of their age,
especially the sexton, who would be
ninety-nine come Martinmas, and whose
father remembered a man who had carried
arrows, as a boy, for the battle of
Flodden Field. The Gray Goose and the
big Miss Jessamine were the only elderly
persons who kept their ages secret. Indeed,
Miss Jessamine never mentioned
any one's age, or recalled the exact year
in which anything had happened. She
said that she had been taught that it
was bad manners to do so "in a mixed
assembly." The Gray Goose also
avoided dates; but this was partly
because her brain, though intelligent, was
not mathematical, and computation was
beyond her. She never got farther than
"last Michaelmas," "the Michaelmas before
that," and "the Michaelmas before
the Michaelmas before that." After this
her head, which was small, became confused,
and she said, "Ga, ga!" and
changed the subject.</p>

<p>But she remembered the little Miss
Jessamine, the Miss Jessamine with the
"conspicuous hair." Her aunt, the big
Miss Jessamine, said it was her only
fault. The hair was clean, was abundant,
was glossy; but do what you would
with it, it never looked quite like other
people's. And at church, after Saturday
night's wash, it shone like the best brass
fender after a spring cleaning. In short,
it was conspicuous, which does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
become a young woman, especially in
church.</p>

<p>Those were worrying times altogether,
and the Green was used for strange purposes.
A political meeting was held on
it with the village Cobbler in the chair,
and a speaker who came by stage-coach
from the town, where they had wrecked
the bakers' shops, and discussed the price
of bread. He came a second time by
stage; but the people had heard something
about him in the meanwhile, and
they did not keep him on the Green.
They took him to the pond and tried to
make him swim, which he could not do,
and the whole affair was very disturbing
to all quiet and peaceable fowls. After
which another man came, and preached
sermons on the Green, and a great many
people went to hear him; for those were
"trying times," and folk ran hither and
thither for comfort. And then what
did they do but drill the ploughboys on
the Green, to get them ready to fight
the French, and teach them the goose-step!
However, that came to an end at
last; for Bony was sent to St. Helena,
and the ploughboys were sent back to
the plough.</p>

<p>Everybody lived in fear of Bony in
those days, especially the naughty children,
who were kept in order during the
day by threats of "Bony shall have you,"
and who had nightmares about him in
the dark. They thought he was an Ogre
in a cocked hat. The Gray Goose
thought he was a Fox, and that all the
men of England were going out in red
coats to hunt him. It was no use to
argue the point; for she had a very small
head, and when one idea got into it there
was no room for another.</p>

<p>Besides, the Gray Goose never saw
Bony, nor did the children, which rather
spoilt the terror of him, so that the Black
Captain became more effective as a Bogy
with hardened offenders. The Gray
Goose remembered <i>his</i> coming to the
place perfectly. What he came for she
did not pretend to know. It was all part
and parcel of the war and bad times.
He was called the Black Captain, partly
because of himself and partly because
of his wonderful black mare. Strange
stories were afloat of how far and how fast
that mare could go when her master's
hand was on her mane and he whispered
in her ear. Indeed, some people thought
we might reckon ourselves very lucky if
we were not out of the frying-pan into
the fire, and had not got a certain well-known
Gentleman of the Road to protect
us against the French. But that, of
course, made him none the less useful to
the Johnsons' Nurse when the little Miss
Johnsons were naughty.</p>

<p>"You leave off crying this minnit,
Miss Jane, or I'll give you right away to
that horrid wicked officer. Jemima! just
look out o' the windy, if you please, and
see if the Black Cap'n's a-coming with
his horse to carry away Miss Jane."</p>

<p>And there, sure enough, the Black
Captain strode by, with his sword clattering
as if it did not know whose head to
cut off first. But he did not call for Miss
Jane that time. He went on to the Green,
where he came so suddenly upon the
eldest Master Johnson, sitting in a puddle
on purpose, in his new nankeen skeleton
suit, that the young gentleman thought
judgment had overtaken him at last,
and abandoned himself to the howlings
of despair. His howls were redoubled
when he was clutched from behind and
swung over the Black Captain's shoulder;
but in five minutes his tears were
stanched, and he was playing with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
officer's accoutrements. All of which
the Gray Goose saw with her own eyes,
and heard afterwards that that bad boy
had been whining to go back to the Black
Captain ever since, which showed how
hardened he was, and that nobody but
Bonaparte himself could be expected to
do him any good.</p>

<p>But those were "trying times." It
was bad enough when the pickle of a
large and respectable family cried for the
Black Captain; when it came to the little
Miss Jessamine crying for him, one felt
that the sooner the French landed and
had done with it, the better.</p>

<p>The big Miss Jessamine's objection to
him was that he was a soldier; and this
prejudice was shared by all the Green.
"A soldier," as the speaker from the
town had observed, "is a bloodthirsty,
unsettled sort of a rascal, that the peaceable,
home-loving, bread-winning citizen
can never conscientiously look on as a
brother till he has beaten his sword into
a ploughshare and his spear into a
pruning-hook."</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was some
truth in what the Postman (an old soldier)
said in reply,&mdash;that the sword has
to cut a way for us out of many a scrape
into which our bread-winners get us when
they drive their ploughshares into fallows
that don't belong to them. Indeed,
whilst our most peaceful citizens were
prosperous chiefly by means of cotton,
of sugar, and of the rise and fall of the
money-market (not to speak of such
salable matters as opium, firearms, and
"black ivory"), disturbances were apt to
arise in India, Africa, and other outlandish
parts, where the fathers of our domestic
race were making fortunes for their
families. And for that matter, even on
the Green, we did not wish the military to
leave us in the lurch, so long as there was
any fear that the French were coming.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>To let the Black Captain have little
Miss Jessamine, however, was another
matter. Her aunt would not hear of it;
and then, to crown all, it appeared that
the Captain's father did not think the
young lady good enough for his son.
Never was any affair more clearly brought
to a conclusion.</p>

<p>But those were "trying times"; and
one moonlight night, when the Gray
Goose was sound asleep upon one leg,
the Green was rudely shaken under her
by the thud of a horse's feet. "Ga,
ga!" said she, putting down the other
leg and running away.</p>

<p>By the time she returned to her place
not a thing was to be seen or heard.
The horse had passed like a shot. But
next day there was hurrying and scurrying
and cackling at a very early hour, all
about the white house with the black
beams, where Miss Jessamine lived.
And when the sun was so low and the
shadows so long on the grass that the
Gray Goose felt ready to run away at the
sight of her own neck, little Miss Jane
Johnson and her "particular friend"
Clarinda sat under the big oak tree on
the Green, and Jane pinched Clarinda's
little finger till she found that she could
keep a secret, and then she told her in
confidence that she had heard from Nurse
and Jemima that Miss Jessamine's niece
had been a very naughty girl, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
that horrid wicked officer had come for
her on his black horse and carried her
right away.</p>

<p>"Will she never come back?" asked
Clarinda.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Jane, decidedly.
"Bony never brings people back."</p>

<p>"Not never no more?" sobbed Clarinda,
for she was weak-minded, and
could not bear to think that Bony never,
never let naughty people go home again.</p>

<p>Next day Jane had heard more.</p>

<p>"He has taken her to a Green."</p>

<p>"A Goose Green?" asked Clarinda.</p>

<p>"No. A Gretna Green. Don't ask so
many questions, child," said Jane, who,
having no more to tell, gave herself airs.</p>

<p>Jane was wrong on one point. Miss
Jessamine's niece did come back, and
she and her husband were forgiven. The
Gray Goose remembered it well; it was
Michaelmas-tide, the Michaelmas before
the Michaelmas before the Michaelmas&mdash;but,
ga, ga! What does the date matter?
It was autumn, harvest-time, and
everybody was so busy prophesying and
praying about the crops, that the young
couple wandered through the lanes, and
got blackberries for Miss Jessamine's
celebrated crab and blackberry jam, and
made guys of themselves with bryony
wreaths, and not a soul troubled his head
about them, except the children and
the Postman. The children dogged the
Black Captain's footsteps (his bubble
reputation as an Ogre having burst)
clamoring for a ride on the black mare.
And the Postman would go somewhat
out of his postal way to catch the Captain's
dark eye, and show that he had not
forgotten how to salute an officer.</p>

<p>But they were "trying times." One
afternoon the black mare was stepping
gently up and down the grass, with her
head at her master's shoulder, and as
many children crowded on to her silky
back as if she had been an elephant in a
menagerie; and the next afternoon she
carried him away, sword and <i>sabre-tache</i>
clattering war music at her side, and the
old Postman waiting for them, rigid with
salutation, at the four cross-roads.</p>

<p>War and bad times! It was a hard
winter; and the big Miss Jessamine and
the little Miss Jessamine (but she was
Mrs. Black-Captain now) lived very
economically, that they might help their
poorer neighbors. They neither entertained
nor went into company; but the
young lady always went up the village as
far as the <i>George and Dragon</i>, for air and
exercise when the London Mail<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> came in.</p>

<p>One day (it was a day in the following
June) it came in earlier than usual, and
the young lady was not there to meet it.</p>

<p>But a crowd soon gathered round the
<i>George and Dragon</i>, gaping to see the
Mail Coach dressed with flowers and oak-leaves,
and the guard wearing a laurel
wreath over and above his royal livery.
The ribbons that decked the horses were
stained and flecked with the warmth
and foam of the pace at which they had
come, for they had pressed on with the
news of Victory.</p>

<p>Miss Jessamine was sitting with her
niece under the oak tree on the Green,
when the Postman put a newspaper
silently into her hand. Her niece turned
quickly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is there news?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't agitate yourself, my dear,"
said her aunt. "I will read it aloud,
and then we can enjoy it together; a far
more comfortable method, my love, than
when you go up the village, and come
home out of breath, having snatched half
the news as you run."</p>

<p>"I am all attention, dear aunt," said
the little lady, clasping her hands tightly
on her lap.</p>

<p>Then Miss Jessamine read aloud,&mdash;she
was proud of her reading,&mdash;and the old
soldier stood at attention behind her,
with such a blending of pride and pity on
his face as it was strange to see:&mdash;</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Downing Street<br /></span>
<i>June</i> 22, 1815, 1 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>"<br />
</div>

<p>"That's one in the morning," gasped
the Postman; "beg your pardon, mum."</p>

<p>But though he apologized, he could
not refrain from echoing here and there
a weighty word: "Glorious victory,"&mdash;"Two
hundred pieces of artillery,"&mdash;"Immense
quantity of ammunition,"&mdash;and
so forth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The loss of the British Army upon this
occasion has unfortunately been most severe.
It had not been possible to make out a

<p>"The list, aunt! Read the list!"</p>

<p>"My love&mdash;my darling&mdash;let us go in

<p>"No. Now! now!"</p>

<p>To one thing the supremely afflicted
are entitled in their sorrow,&mdash;to be
obeyed; and yet it is the last kindness
that people commonly will do them.
But Miss Jessamine did. Steadying her
voice, as best she might, she read on;
and the old soldier stood bareheaded to
hear that first Roll of the Dead at Waterloo,
which began with the Duke of Brunswick
and ended with Ensign Brown.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>

<p>Three days later, the Captain's wife

son, a purple-red morsel of humanity
with conspicuously golden hair.</p>

<p>"Will he live, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Live? God bless my soul, ma'am.
Look at him! The young Jackanapes!"</p>


<div class='center'><br />CHAPTER II<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
And he wandered away and away<br />
With Nature, the dear old Nurse.<br />
</div>

<div class='sig'>
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Longfellow</span><br /></div>

<p>The Gray Goose remembered quite
well the year that Jackanapes began to
walk, for it was the year that the speckled
hen for the first time in all her motherly
life got out of patience when she was
sitting. She had been rather proud of
the eggs,&mdash;they were unusually large,&mdash;but
she never felt quite comfortable on
them, and whether it was because she
used to get cramp and go off the nest, or
because the season was bad, or what, she
never could tell; but every egg was addled
but one, and the one that did hatch gave
her more trouble than any chick she had
ever reared.</p>

<p>It was a fine, downy, bright yellow
little thing, but it had a monstrous big
nose and feet, and such an ungainly walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
as she knew no other instance of in
her well-bred and high-stepping family.
And as to behavior, it was not that it was
either quarrelsome or moping, but simply
unlike the rest. When the other chicks
hopped and cheeped on the Green about
their mother's feet, this solitary yellow
brat went waddling off on its own responsibility,
and do or cluck what the speckled
hen would, it went to play in the pond.</p>

<p>It was off one day as usual, and the
hen was fussing and fuming after it,
when the Postman, going to deliver a
letter at Miss Jessamine's door, was
nearly knocked over by the good lady
herself, who, bursting out of the house
with her cap just off and her bonnet just
not on, fell into his arms, crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Baby! Baby! Jackanapes! Jackanapes!"</p>

<p>If the Postman loved anything on
earth, he loved the Captain's yellow-haired
child; so, propping Miss Jessamine
against her own door-post, he followed the
direction of her trembling fingers and
made for the Green.</p>

<p>Jackanapes had had the start of the
Postman by nearly ten minutes. The
world&mdash;the round green world with an
oak tree on it&mdash;was just becoming very
interesting to him. He had tried, vigorously
but ineffectually, to mount a passing
pig the last time he was taken out
walking; but then he was encumbered
with a nurse. Now he was his own master,
and might, by courage and energy,
become the master of that delightful
downy, dumpy, yellow thing that was
bobbing along over the green grass in
front of him. Forward! Charge! He
aimed well, and grabbed it, but only to
feel the delicious downiness and dumpiness
slipping through his fingers as he
fell upon his face. "Quawk!" said the
yellow thing, and wabbled off sideways.
It was this oblique movement that
enabled Jackanapes to come up with it,
for it was bound for the Pond, and therefore
obliged to come back into line. He
failed again from top-heaviness, and his
prey escaped sideways as before, and, as
before, lost ground in getting back to the
direct road to the Pond.</p>

<p>And at the Pond the Postman found
them both,&mdash;one yellow thing rocking
safely on the ripples that lie beyond duckweed,
and the other washing his draggled
frock with tears because he too had tried
to sit upon the Pond and it wouldn't
hold him.</p>

<div class='sig'>
&mdash;<span class="smcap">George Herbert</span><br /></div>

<p>Young Mrs. Johnson, who was a
mother of many, hardly knew which to
pity more,&mdash;Miss Jessamine for having
her little ways and her antimacassars
rumpled by a young Jackanapes, or the
boy himself for being brought up by an
old maid.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, she would probably
have pitied neither, had Jackanapes been
a girl. (One is so apt to think that what
works smoothest, works to the highest
ends, having no patience for the results
of friction.) That father in God who
bade the young men to be pure and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
maidens brave, greatly disturbed a member
of his congregation, who thought
that the great preacher had made a slip
of the tongue.</p>

<p>"That the girls should have purity,
and the boys courage, is what you would
say, good father?"</p>

<p>"Nature has done that," was the reply;
"I meant what I said."</p>

<p>In good sooth, a young maid is all the
better for learning some robuster virtues
than maidenliness and not to move the
antimacassars; and the robuster virtues
require some fresh air and freedom. As,
on the other hand, Jackanapes (who had
a boy's full share of the little beast and
the young monkey in his natural composition)
was none the worse, at his tender
years, for learning some maidenliness,&mdash;so
far as maidenliness means decency,
pity, unselfishness, and pretty behavior.</p>

<p>And it is due to him to say that he was an
obedient boy, and a boy whose word could
be depended on, long before his grandfather
the General came to live at the Green.</p>

<p>He was obedient; that is, he did what
his great-aunt told him. But&mdash;oh, dear!
oh, dear!&mdash;the pranks he played, which it
had never entered into her head to forbid!</p>

<p>It was when he had just been put into
skeletons (frocks never suited him) that
he became very friendly with Master
Tony Johnson, a younger brother of the
young gentleman who sat in the puddle
on purpose. Tony was not enterprising,
and Jackanapes led him by the nose.
One summer's evening they were out
late, and Miss Jessamine was becoming
anxious, when Jackanapes presented himself
with a ghastly face all besmirched
with tears. He was unusually subdued.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," he sobbed,&mdash;"if you
please, I'm very much afraid that Tony
Johnson's dying in the churchyard."</p>

<p>Miss Jessamine was just beginning to
be distracted, when she smelt Jackanapes.</p>

<p>"You naughty, naughty boys! Do
you mean to tell me that you've been
smoking?"</p>

<p>"Not pipes," urged Jackanapes; "upon
my honor, aunty, not pipes. Only cigars
like Mr. Johnson's! and only made of
brown paper with a very, very little
tobacco from the shop inside them."</p>

<p>Whereupon Miss Jessamine sent a
servant to the churchyard, who found
Tony Johnson lying on a tombstone, very
sick, and having ceased to entertain any
hopes of his own recovery.</p>

<p>If it could be possible that any "unpleasantness"
could arise between two
such amiable neighbors as Miss Jessamine
and Mrs. Johnson, and if the still more
incredible paradox can be that ladies
may differ over a point on which they
are agreed, that point was the admitted
fact that Tony Johnson was "delicate";
and the difference lay chiefly in this:
Mrs. Johnson said that Tony was delicate,&mdash;meaning
that he was more finely
strung, more sensitive, a properer subject
for pampering and petting, than Jackanapes,
and that, consequently, Jackanapes
was to blame for leading Tony into
scrapes which resulted in his being chilled,
frightened, or (most frequently) sick.
But when Miss Jessamine said that Tony
Johnson was delicate, she meant that he
was more puling, less manly, and less
healthily brought up than Jackanapes,
who, when they got into mischief together,
was certainly not to blame because his
friend could not get wet, sit a kicking
donkey, ride in the giddy-go-round, bear
the noise of a cracker, or smoke brown
paper with impunity, as he could.</p>

<p>Not that there was ever the slightest
quarrel between the ladies. It never even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
came near it, except the day after Tony had
been so very sick with riding Bucephalus
on the giddy-go-round. Mrs. Johnson had
explained to Miss Jessamine that the reason
Tony was so easily upset was the unusual
sensitiveness (as a doctor had explained
it to her) of the nervous centers in her
family&mdash;"Fiddlestick!" So Mrs. Johnson
understood Miss Jessamine to say; but it
appeared that she only said "Treaclestick!"
which is quite another thing, and of which
Tony was undoubtedly fond.</p>

<p>It was at the Fair that Tony was made
ill by riding on Bucephalus. Once a year
the Goose Green became the scene of a
carnival. First of all, carts and caravans
were rumbling up all along, day and
night. Jackanapes could hear them as
he lay in bed, and could hardly sleep for
speculating what booths and whirligigs
he should find fairly established when he
and his dog Spitfire went out after breakfast.
As a matter of fact, he seldom had
to wait so long for news of the Fair.
The Postman knew the window out of
which Jackanapes's yellow head would
come, and was ready with his report.</p>

<p>"Royal Theayter, Master Jackanapes,
in the old place, but be careful o' them
seats, sir; they're rickettier than ever.
Two sweets and a ginger beer under the
Oak tree, and the Flying Boats is just
a-coming along the road."</p>

<p>No doubt it was partly because he had
already suffered severely in the Flying
Boats that Tony collapsed so quickly in
the giddy-go-round. He only mounted
Bucephalus (who was spotted, and had
no tail) because Jackanapes urged him,
and held out the ingenious hope that the
round-and-round feeling would very
likely cure the up-and-down sensation.
It did not, however, and Tony tumbled
off during the first revolution.</p>

<p>Jackanapes was not absolutely free
from qualms; but having once mounted
the Black Prince, he stuck to him as a
horseman should. During the first
round he waved his hat, and observed
with some concern that the Black Prince
had lost an ear since last Fair; at the
second, he looked a little pale, but sat
upright, though somewhat unnecessarily
rigid; at the third round he shut his eyes.
During the fourth his hat fell off, and he
clasped his horse's neck. By the fifth
he had laid his yellow head against the
Black Prince's mane, and so clung anyhow
till the hobby-horses stopped, when
the proprietor assisted him to alight, and
he sat down rather suddenly and said he
had enjoyed it very much.</p>

<p>The Gray Goose always ran away at
the first approach of the caravans, and
never came back to the Green till there
was nothing left of the Fair but footmarks
and oyster-shells. Running away
was her pet principle; the only system,
she maintained, by which you can live
long and easily and lose nothing. If
you run away when you see danger, you
can come back when all is safe. Run
quickly, return slowly, hold your head
high, and gabble as loud as you can, and
you'll preserve the respect of the Goose
Green to a peaceful old age. Why
should you struggle and get hurt, if you
can lower your head and swerve, and not
lose a feather?! Why in the world should
any one spoil the pleasure of life, or risk
his skin, if he can help it?</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'What's the use?'<br />
Said the Goose."<br />
</div>

<p>Before answering which one might have
to consider what world, which life, and
whether his skin were a goose-skin; but
the Gray Goose's head would never have
held all that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>Grass soon grows over footprints, and
the village children took the oyster-shells
to trim their gardens with; but the year
after Tony rode Bucephalus there lingered
another relic of Fair-time in which
Jackanapes was deeply interested. "The
Green" proper was originally only part
of a straggling common, which in its
turn merged into some wilder waste land
where gypsies sometimes squatted if the
authorities would allow them, especially
after the annual Fair. And it was after
the Fair that Jackanapes, out rambling
by himself, was knocked over by the
Gypsy's son riding the Gypsy's red-haired
pony at breakneck pace across the
common.</p>

<p>Jackanapes got up and shook himself,
none the worse except for being heels over
head in love with the red-haired pony.
What a rate he went at! How he spurned
the ground with his nimble feet! How
his red coat shone in the sunshine! And
what bright eyes peeped out of his dark
forelock as it was blown by the wind!</p>

<p>The Gypsy boy had had a fright, and
he was willing enough to reward Jackanapes
for not having been hurt, by consenting
to let him have a ride.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to kill the little fine
gentleman, and swing us all on the gibbet,
you rascal?" screamed the Gypsy
mother, who came up just as Jackanapes
and the pony set off.</p>

<p>"He would get on," replied her son.
"It'll not kill him. He'll fall on his yellow
head, and it's as tough as a cocoanut."</p>

<p>But Jackanapes did not fall. He
stuck to the red-haired pony as he had
stuck to the hobby-horse; but, oh, how
different the delight of this wild gallop
with flesh and blood! Just as his legs
were beginning to feel as if he did not
feel them, the Gypsy boy cried, "Lollo!"
Round went the pony so unceremoniously
that with as little ceremony Jackanapes
clung to his neck; and he did not
properly recover himself before Lollo
stopped with a jerk at the place where
they had started.</p>

<p>"Is his name Lollo?" asked Jackanapes,
his hand lingering in the wiry
mane.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What does Lollo mean?"</p>

<p>"Red."</p>

<p>"Is Lollo your pony?"</p>

<p>"No. My father's." And the Gypsy
boy led Lollo away.</p>

<p>At the first opportunity Jackanapes
stole away again to the common. This
time he saw the Gypsy father, smoking
a dirty pipe.</p>

<p>"Lollo is your pony, isn't he?" said
Jackanapes.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He's a very nice one."</p>

<p>"He's a racer."</p>

<p>"You don't want to sell him, do you?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen pounds," said the Gypsy
father; and Jackanapes sighed and went
home again. That very afternoon he
and Tony rode the two donkeys; and
Tony managed to get thrown, and even
Jackanapes's donkey kicked. But it was
jolting, clumsy work after the elastic
swiftness and the dainty mischief of the
red-haired pony.</p>

<p>A few days later, Miss Jessamine spoke
very seriously to Jackanapes. She was
a good deal agitated as she told him that
his grandfather the General was coming
to the Green, and that he must be on his
very best behavior during the visit. If
it had been feasible to leave off calling
him Jackanapes and to get used to his
baptismal name of Theodore before the
day after to-morrow (when the General<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
was due), it would have been satisfactory.
But Miss Jessamine feared it
would be impossible in practice, and she
had scruples about it on principle. It
would not seem quite truthful, although
she had always most fully intended that
he should be called Theodore when he
had outgrown the ridiculous appropriateness
of his nickname. The fact was
that he had not outgrown it, but he must
take care to remember who was meant
when his grandfather said Theodore.</p>

<p>Indeed, for that matter, he must take
care all along.</p>

<p>"You are apt to be giddy, Jackanapes,"
said Miss Jessamine.</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt," said Jackanapes, thinking
of the hobby-horses.</p>

<p>"You are a good boy, Jackanapes.
Thank God, I can tell your grandfather
that. An obedient boy, an honorable
boy, and a kind-hearted boy. But you
are&mdash;in short, you <i>are</i> a Boy, Jackanapes.
And I hope," added Miss Jessamine,
desperate with the results of experience,
"that the General knows that Boys will
be Boys."</p>

<p>What mischief could be foreseen,
Jackanapes promised to guard against.
He was to keep his clothes and his hands
clean, to look over his catechism, not to
put sticky things in his pockets, to keep
that hair of his smooth ("It's the wind
that blows it, aunty," said Jackanapes&mdash;"I'll
send by the coach for some bear's-grease,"
said Miss Jessamine, tying a knot
in her pocket-handkerchief), not to burst
in at the parlor door, not to talk at the
top of his voice, not to crumple his Sunday
frill, and to sit quite quiet during the
sermon, to be sure to say "sir" to the
General, to be careful about rubbing his
shoes on the door-mat, and to bring his
lesson-books to his aunt at once that she
might iron down the dogs'-ears. The
General arrived; and for the first day all
went well, except that Jackanapes's hair
was as wild as usual, for the hair-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dresser'">dresser</ins>
had no bear's-grease left. He began to
feel more at ease with his grandfather,
and disposed to talk confidentially with
him, as he did with the Postman. All
that the General felt, it would take too
long to tell; but the result was the same.
He was disposed to talk confidentially
with Jackanapes.</p>

<p>"Mons'ous pretty place this," he said,
looking out of the lattice on to the
Green, where the grass was vivid with
sunset and the shadows were long and
peaceful.</p>

<p>"You should see it in Fair-week, sir,"
said Jackanapes, shaking his yellow mop,
and leaning back in his one of the two
Chippendale arm-chairs in which they sat.</p>

<p>"A fine time that, eh?" said the General,
with a twinkle in his left eye (the
other was glass).</p>

<p>Jackanapes shook his hair once more.
"I enjoyed this last one the best of all,"
he said. "I'd so much money."</p>

<p>"By George, it's not a common complaint
in these bad times. How much
had ye?"</p>

<p>"I'd two shillings. A new shilling
aunty gave me, and elevenpence I had
saved up, and a penny from the Postman,&mdash;<i>sir!</i>"
added Jackanapes with a
jerk, having forgotten it.</p>

<p>"And how did ye spend it,&mdash;<i>sir?</i>"
inquired the General.</p>

<p>Jackanapes spread his ten fingers on
the arms of his chair, and shut his eyes
that he might count the more conscientiously.</p>

<p>"Watch-stand for aunty, threepence.
Trumpet for myself, twopence; that's
fivepence. Gingernuts for Tony, two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>pence,
and a mug with a Grenadier on for
the Postman, fourpence; that's elevenpence.
Shooting-gallery a penny; that's
a shilling. Giddy-go-round, a penny;
that's one and a penny. Treating Tony,
one and twopence. Flying Boats (Tony
paid for himself), a penny, one and threepence.
Shooting-gallery again, one and
fourpence; Fat Woman a penny, one and
fivepence. Giddy-go-round again, one
and sixpence. Shooting-gallery, one and
sevenpence. Treating Tony, and then
he wouldn't shoot, so I did, one and
eightpence. Living Skeleton, a penny&mdash;no,
Tony treated me, the Living Skeleton
doesn't count. Skittles, a penny, one
and ninepence. Mermaid (but when
we got inside she was dead), a penny,
one and tenpence. Theater, a penny
(Priscilla Partington, or the Green Lane
Murder. A beautiful young lady, sir,
with pink cheeks and a real pistol); that's
one and elevenpence. Ginger beer, a
penny (I <i>was</i> so thirsty!), two shillings.
And then the Shooting-gallery man gave
me a turn for nothing, because, he said,
I was a real gentleman, and spent my
money like a man."</p>

<p>"So you do, sir, so you do!" cried the
General. "Egad, sir, you spent it like
a prince. And now I suppose you've not
got a penny in your pocket?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," said Jackanapes. "Two
pennies. They are saving up." And
Jackanapes jingled them with his hand.</p>

<p>"You don't want money except at
Fair-times, I suppose?" said the General.</p>

<p>Jackanapes shook his mop.</p>

<p>"If I could have as much as I want, I
should know what to buy," said he.</p>

<p>"And how much do you want, if you
could get it?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, sir, till I think what
twopence from fifteen pounds leaves.
Two from nothing you can't, but borrow
twelve. Two from twelve, ten, and
carry one. Please remember ten, sir,
when I ask you. One from nothing you
can't, borrow twenty. One from twenty,
nineteen, and carry one. One from fifteen,
fourteen. Fourteen pounds nineteen
and&mdash;what did I tell you to remember?"</p>

<p>"Ten," said the General.</p>

<p>"Fourteen pounds nineteen shillings
and tenpence, then, is what I want,"
said Jackanapes.</p>

<p>"God bless my soul! what for?"</p>

<p>"To buy Lollo with. Lollo means
red, sir. The Gypsy's red-haired pony,
sir. Oh, he <i>is</i> beautiful! You should
see his coat in the sunshine! You should
see his mane! You should see his tail!
Such little feet, sir, and they go like
lightning! Such a dear face, too, and
eyes like a mouse! But he's a racer, and
the Gypsy wants fifteen pounds for him."</p>

<p>"If he's a racer you couldn't ride him.
Could you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;o, sir, but I can stick to him. I
did the other day."</p>

<p>"The dooce you did! Well, I'm fond
of riding myself; and if the beast is as
good as you say, he might suit me."</p>

<p>"You're too tall for Lollo, I think,"
said Jackanapes, measuring his grandfather
with his eye.</p>

<p>"I can double up my legs, I suppose.
We'll have a look at him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Don't you weigh a good deal?" asked
Jackanapes.</p>

<p>"Chiefly waistcoats," said the General,
slapping the breast of his military frock-coat.
"We'll have the little racer on the
Green the first thing in the morning.
Glad you mentioned it, grandson; glad
you mentioned it."</p>

<p>The General was as good as his word.
Next morning the Gypsy and Lollo, Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
Jessamine, Jackanapes and his grandfather
and his dog Spitfire, were all gathered
at one end of the Green in a group,
which so aroused the innocent curiosity
of Mrs. Johnson, as she saw it from one
of her upper windows, that she and the
children took their early promenade
rather earlier than usual. The General
talked to the Gypsy, and Jackanapes
fondled Lollo's mane, and did not know
whether he should be more glad or
miserable if his grandfather bought him.</p>

<p>"Jackanapes!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"I've bought Lollo, but I believe you
were right. He hardly stands high enough
for me. If you can ride him to the other
end of the Green, I'll give him to you."</p>

<p>How Jackanapes tumbled on to Lollo's
back he never knew. He had just gathered
up the reins when the Gypsy father
took him by the arm.</p>

<p>"If you want to make Lollo go fast,
my little gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> can make him go!" said Jackanapes;
and drawing from his pocket the
trumpet he had bought in the Fair, he
blew a blast both loud and shrill.</p>

<p>Away went Lollo, and away went
Jackanapes's hat. His golden hair flew
out, an aureole from which his cheeks
shone red and distended with trumpeting.
Away went Spitfire, mad with the rapture
of the race and the wind in his silky ears.
Away went the geese, the cocks, the hens,
and the whole family of Johnson. Lucy
clung to her mamma, Jane saved Emily
by the gathers of her gown, and Tony
saved himself by a somersault.</p>

<p>The Gray Goose was just returning
when Jackanapes and Lollo rode back,
Spitfire panting behind.</p>

<p>"Good, my little gentleman, good!"
said the Gypsy. "You were born to the
saddle. You've the flat thigh, the
strong knee, the wiry back, and the light
caressing hand; all you want is to learn
the whisper. Come here!"</p>

<p>"What was that dirty fellow talking
about, grandson?" asked the General.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, sir. It's a secret."</p>

<p>They were sitting in the window again,
in the two Chippendale arm-chairs, the
General devouring every line of his
grandson's face, with strange spasms
crossing his own.</p>

<p>"You must love your aunt very much,
Jackanapes?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir," said Jackanapes, warmly.</p>

<p>"And whom do you love next best to
your aunt?"</p>

<p>The ties of blood were pressing very
strongly on the General himself, and perhaps
he thought of Lollo. But love is
not bought in a day, even with fourteen
pounds nineteen shillings and tenpence.
Jackanapes answered quite readily, "The
Postman."</p>

<p>"Why the Postman?"</p>

<p>"He knew my father," said Jackanapes,
"and he tells me about him and
about his black mare. My father was a
soldier, a brave soldier. He died at
Waterloo. When I grow up I want to be
a soldier too."</p>

<p>"So you shall, my boy; so you shall."</p>

<p>"Thank you, grandfather. Aunty
doesn't want me to be a soldier, for fear
of being killed."</p>

<p>"Bless my life! Would she have you
get into a feather-bed and stay there?
Why, you might be killed by a thunderbolt
if you were a butter-merchant!"</p>

<p>"So I might. I shall tell her so.
What a funny fellow you are, sir! I say,
do you think my father knew the Gypsy's
secret? The Postman says he used to
whisper to his black mare."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your father was taught to ride, as a
child, by one of those horsemen of the East
who swoop and dart and wheel about a
plain like swallows in autumn. Grandson!
love me a little too. I can tell you more
about your father than the Postman can."</p>

<p>"I do love you," said Jackanapes.
"Before you came I was frightened. I'd
no notion you were so nice."</p>

<p>"Love me always, boy, whatever I do
or leave undone. And&mdash;God help me!&mdash;whatever
you do or leave undone, I'll
love you. There shall never be a cloud
between us for a day; no, sir, not for an
hour. We're imperfect enough, all of us&mdash;we
needn't be so bitter; and life is
uncertain enough at its safest&mdash;we
needn't waste its opportunities. God
bless my soul! Here sit I, after a dozen
battles and some of the worst climates
in the world, and by yonder lych gate lies
your mother, who didn't move five miles,
I suppose, from your aunt's apron-strings,&mdash;dead
in her teens; my golden-haired
daughter, whom I never saw!"</p>

<p>Jackanapes was terribly troubled.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, grandfather," he pleaded,
his own blue eyes round with tears. "I
will love you very much, and I will try
to be very good. But I should like to
be a soldier."</p>

<p>"You shall, my boy; you shall.
You've more claims for a commission
than you know of. Cavalry, I suppose;
eh, ye young Jackanapes? Well, well; if
you live to be an honor to your country,
this old heart shall grow young again
with pride for you; and if you die in the
service of your country&mdash;egad, sir, it
can but break for ye!"</p>

<p>And beating the region which he said
was all waistcoats, as if they stifled him,
the old man got up and strode out on
to the Green.</p>


<div class='center'><br />CHAPTER IV</div>

<div class='blockquot'><i>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man
lay down his life for his friends.</i>&mdash;John 15:13.</div>

<p>Twenty and odd years later the Gray
Goose was still alive, and in full possession
of her faculties, such as they were. She
lived slowly and carefully, and she lived
long. So did Miss Jessamine; but the
General was dead.</p>

<p>He had lived on the Green for many
years, during which he and the Postman
saluted each other with a punctiliousness
that it almost drilled one to witness. He
would have completely spoiled Jackanapes
if Miss Jessamine's conscience
would have let him; otherwise he somewhat
dragooned his neighbors, and was
as positive about parish matters as a
rate-payer about the army. A stormy-tempered,
tender-hearted soldier, irritable
with the suffering of wounds of which he
never spoke, whom all the village followed
to his grave with tears.</p>

<p>The General's death was a great
shock to Miss Jessamine, and her nephew
stayed with her for some little time after
the funeral. Then he was obliged to
join his regiment, which was ordered
abroad.</p>

<p>One effect of the conquest which the
General had gained over the affections
of the village was a considerable abatement
of the popular prejudice against
"the military." Indeed, the village was
now somewhat importantly represented
in the army. There was the General
himself, and the Postman, and the Black
Captain's tablet in the church, and
Jackanapes, and Tony Johnson, and a
Trumpeter.</p>

<p>Tony Johnson had no more natural
taste for fighting than for riding, but he
was as devoted as ever to Jackanapes.
And that was how it came about that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
Mr. Johnson bought him a commission
in the same cavalry regiment that the
General's grandson (whose commission
had been given him by the Iron Duke)
was in; and that he was quite content to
be the butt of the mess where Jackanapes
was the hero; and that when Jackanapes
wrote home to Miss Jessamine, Tony
wrote with the same purpose to his
mother,&mdash;namely, to demand her congratulations
that they were on active
service at last, and were ordered to the
front. And he added a postscript, to
the effect that she could have no idea how
popular Jackanapes was, nor how splendidly
he rode the wonderful red charger
which he had named after his old friend
Lollo.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Sound Retire!"</p>

<p>A Boy Trumpeter, grave with the weight
of responsibilities and accoutrements
beyond his years, and stained so that his
own mother would not have known him,
with the sweat and dust of battle, did as
he was bid; and then, pushing his trumpet
pettishly aside, adjusted his weary legs
for the hundredth time to the horse which
was a world too big for him, and muttering,
"'Tain't a pretty tune," tried to see
something of this his first engagement
before it came to an end.</p>

<p>Being literally in the thick of it, he
could hardly have seen less or known less
of what happened in that particular skirmish
if he had been at home in England.
For many good reasons,&mdash;including dust
and smoke, and that what attention he
dared distract from his commanding
officer was pretty well absorbed by keeping
his hard-mouthed troop-horse in
hand, under pain of execration by his
neighbors in the m&eacute;l&eacute;e. By and by, when
the newspapers came out, if he could get
a look at one before it was thumbed to
bits, he would learn that the enemy had
appeared from ambush in overwhelming
numbers, and that orders had been given
to fall back, which was done slowly and
in good order, the men fighting as they
retired.</p>

<p>Born and bred on the Goose Green,
the youngest of Mr. Johnson's gardener's
numerous offspring, the boy had given
his family no "peace" till they let him
"go for a soldier" with Master Tony and
Master Jackanapes. They consented at
last, with more tears than they shed
when an elder son was sent to jail for
poaching; and the boy was perfectly
happy in his life, and full of <i>esprit de
corps</i>. It was this which had been
wounded by having to sound retreat for
"the young gentlemen's regiment," the
first time he served with it before the
enemy; and he was also harassed by
having completely lost sight of Master
Tony. There had been some hard fighting
before the backward movement began,
and he had caught sight of him once, but
not since. On the other hand, all the
pulses of his village pride had been
stirred by one or two visions of Master
Jackanapes whirling about on his wonderful
horse. He had been easy to distinguish,
since an eccentric blow had
bared his head without hurting it; for
his close golden mop of hair gleamed in
the hot sunshine as brightly as the steel
of the sword flashing round it.</p>

<p>Of the missiles that fell pretty thickly,
the Boy Trumpeter did not take much
notice. First, one can't attend to everything,
and his hands were full; secondly,
one gets used to anything; thirdly, experience
soon teaches one, in spite of proverbs,
how very few bullets find their
billet. Far more unnerving is the mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
suspicion of fear or even of anxiety in the
human mass around you. The Boy was
beginning to wonder if there were any
dark reason for the increasing pressure,
and whether they would be allowed to
move back more quickly, when the smoke
in front lifted for a moment, and he could
see the plain, and the enemy's line some
two hundred yards away. And across the
the plain between them, he saw Master
Jackanapes galloping alone at the top of
Lollo's speed, their faces to the enemy,
his golden head at Lollo's ear.</p>

<p>But at this moment noise and smoke
seemed to burst out on every side; the
officer shouted to him to sound Retire!
and between trumpeting and bumping
about on his horse, he saw and heard no
more of the incidents of his first battle.</p>

<p>Tony Johnson was always unlucky
with horses, from the days of the giddy-go-round
onwards. On this day&mdash;of all
days in the year&mdash;his own horse was on
the sick list, and he had to ride an inferior,
ill-conditioned beast, and fell off that, at
the very moment when it was matter of
life or death to be able to ride away.
The horse fell on him, but struggled up
again, and Tony managed to keep hold
of it. It was in trying to remount that
he discovered, by helplessness and anguish,
that one of his legs was crushed and
broken, and that no feat of which he was
master would get him into the saddle.
Not able even to stand alone, awkwardly,
agonizingly, unable to mount his restive
horse, his life was yet so strong within
him! And on one side of him rolled the
dust and smoke-cloud of his advancing
foes, and on the other, that which covered
his retreating friends.</p>

<p>He turned one piteous gaze after them,
with a bitter twinge, not of reproach, but
of loneliness; and then, dragging himself
up by the side of his horse, he turned the
other way and drew out his pistol, and
waited for the end. Whether he waited
seconds or minutes he never knew, before
some one gripped him by the arm.</p>

<p>"<i>Jackanapes! God bless you!</i> It's my
left leg. If you <i>could</i> get me on&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was like Tony's luck that his pistol
went off at his horse's tail, and made it
plunge; but Jackanapes threw him across
the saddle.</p>

<p>"Hold on anyhow, and stick your
spur in. I'll lead him. Keep your head
down; they're firing high."</p>

<p>And Jackanapes laid his head down&mdash;to
Lollo's ear.</p>

<p>It was when they were fairly off, that
a sudden upspringing of the enemy in all
directions had made it necessary to
change the gradual retirement of our
force into as rapid a retreat as possible.
And when Jackanapes became aware of
this, and felt the lagging and swerving
of Tony's horse, he began to wish he had
thrown his friend across his own saddle
and left their lives to Lollo.</p>

<p>When Tony became aware of it, several
things came into his head: 1. That the
dangers of their ride for life were now
more than doubled; 2. That if Jackanapes
and Lollo were not burdened with
him they would undoubtedly escape;
3. That Jackanapes's life was infinitely
valuable, and his&mdash;Tony's&mdash;was not;
4. That this, if he could seize it, was the
supremest of all the moments in which
he had tried to assume the virtues which
Jackanapes had by nature; and that if
he could be courageous and unselfish
now&mdash;</p>

<p>He caught at his own reins and spoke
very loud,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jackanapes! It won't do. You and
Lollo must go on. Tell the fellows I gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
you back to them with all my heart.
Jackanapes, if you love me, leave me!"</p>

<p>There was a daffodil light over the
evening sky in front of them, and it
shone strangely on Jackanapes's hair and
face. He turned with an odd look in his
eyes that a vainer man than Tony Johnson
might have taken for brotherly pride.
Then he shook his mop, and laughed at
him,</p>

<p>"<i>Leave you?</i> To save my skin? No,
Tony, not to save my soul!"</p>


<div class='center'><br />CHAPTER V</div>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valiant</span> <i>summoned. His Will. His last

<p>Then said he, "I am going to my Father's.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
My Sword I give to him that shall
succeed me in my Pilgrimage, and my Courage
and Skill to him that can get it." .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
as he went down deeper, he said, "Grave, where
is thy Victory?"</p>

<p>So he passed over, and all the Trumpets
sounded for him on the other side.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Bunyan</span>, <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i><br /></div></div>

<p>Coming out of a hospital tent, at headquarters,
the surgeon cannoned against,
and rebounded from, another officer,&mdash;a
sallow man, not young, with a face worn
more by ungentle experiences than by
age, with weary eyes that kept their own
counsel, iron-gray hair, and a moustache
that was as if a raven had laid its wing
across his lips and sealed them.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Major. Didn't see you.
Oh, compound fracture and bruises.
But it's all right; he'll pull through."</p>

<p>"Thank God."</p>

<p>It was probably an involuntary expression;
for prayer and praise were not much
in the Major's line, as a jerk of the surgeon's
head would have betrayed to an
observer. He was a bright little man,
with his feelings showing all over him,
but with gallantry and contempt of death
enough for both sides of his profession;
who took a cool head, a white handkerchief,
and a case of instruments, where
other men went hot blooded with weapons,
and who was the biggest gossip, male
or female, of the regiment. Not even
the major's taciturnity daunted him.</p>

<p>"Didn't think he'd as much pluck
about him as he has. He'll do all right
if he doesn't fret himself into a fever
about poor Jackanapes."</p>

<p>"Whom are you talking about?" asked
the Major, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Young Johnson. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What about Jackanapes?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know? Sad business.
Rode back for Johnson, and brought him
in; but, monstrous ill-luck, hit as they
rode. Left lung&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will he recover?"</p>

<p>"No. Sad business. What a frame&mdash;what
limbs&mdash;what health&mdash;and what
good looks! Finest young fellow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"In his own tent," said the surgeon,
sadly.</p>

<p>The Major wheeled and left him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Can I do anything else for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, thank you. Except&mdash;Major!
I wish I could get you to appreciate
Johnson."</p>

<p>"This is not an easy moment, Jackanapes."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you, sir&mdash;<i>he</i> never will&mdash;that
if he could have driven me from him,
he would be lying yonder at this moment,
and I should be safe and sound."</p>

<p>The Major laid his hand over his
mouth, as if to keep back a wish he
would have been ashamed to utter.</p>

<p>"I've known old Tony from a child.
He's a fool on impulse, a good man and
a gentleman in principle. And he acts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
on principle, which it's not every&mdash;Some
water, please! Thank you, sir.
It's very hot, and yet one's feet get uncommonly
cold. Oh, thank you, thank
you. He's no fire-eater, but he has a
trained conscience and a tender heart,
and he'll do his duty when a braver and
more selfish man might fail you. But
he wants encouragement; and when I'm
gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He shall have encouragement. You
have my word for it. Can I do nothing
else?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Major. A favor."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jackanapes."</p>

<p>"Be Lollo's master, and love him as
well as you can. He's used to it."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you rather Johnson had him?"</p>

<p>The blue eyes twinkled in spite of mortal
pain.</p>

<p>"Tony <i>rides</i> on principle, Major. His
legs are bolsters, and will be to the end
of the chapter. I couldn't insult dear
Lollo; but if you don't care&mdash;"</p>

<p>"While I live&mdash;which will be longer
than I desire or deserve&mdash;Lollo shall
want nothing but&mdash;you. I have too little
tenderness for&mdash;My dear boy, you're
faint. Can you spare me for a moment?"</p>

<p>"No, stay&mdash;Major!"</p>

<p>"What? What?"</p>

<p>"My head drifts so&mdash;if you wouldn't
mind."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!"</p>

<p>"Say a prayer by me. Out loud,
please; I am getting deaf."</p>

<p>"My dearest Jackanapes&mdash;my dear
boy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One of the Church Prayers&mdash;Parade
Service, you know."</p>

<p>"I see. But the fact is&mdash;God forgive
me, Jackanapes!&mdash;I'm a very different
sort of fellow to some of you youngsters.
Look here, let me fetch&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Jackanapes's hand was in his, and
it would not let go.</p>

<p>There was a brief and bitter silence.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul I can only remember
the little one at the end."</p>

<p>"Please," whispered Jackanapes.</p>

<p>Pressed by the conviction that what
little he could do it was his duty to do,
the Major, kneeling, bared his head, and
spoke loudly, clearly, and very reverently,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jackanapes moved his left hand to his
right one, which still held the Major's.</p>

<p>"The love of God&mdash;"</p>

<p>And with that&mdash;Jackanapes died.</p>


<div class='center'><br />CHAPTER VI</div>

<div class="blockquot">Und so ist der blaue Himmel gr&ouml;sser als jedes
Gew&ouml;lk darin, und dauerhafter dazu.<br />

<div class='sig'>
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jean Paul Richter</span><br /></div></div>

<p>Jackanapes's death was sad news for
the Goose Green, a sorrow just qualified
by honorable pride in his gallantry and
devotion. Only the Cobbler dissented;
but that was his way. He said he saw
nothing in it but foolhardiness and vainglory.
They might both have been
killed, as easy as not; and then where
would ye have been? A man's life was
a man's life, and one life was as good as
another. No one would catch him
throwing his away. And, for that matter,
Mrs. Johnson could spare a child a
great deal better than Miss Jessamine.</p>

<p>But the parson preached Jackanapes's
funeral sermon on the text, "Whosoever
will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever
will lose his life for my sake shall find
it"; and all the village went and wept to
hear him.</p>

<p>Nor did Miss Jessamine see her loss
from the Cobbler's point of view. On the
contrary, Mrs. Johnson said she never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
to her dying day should forget how, when
she went to condole with her, the old lady
came forward, with gentlewomanly self-control,
and kissed her, and thanked God
that her dear nephew's effort had been
blessed with success, and that this sad
war had made no gap in her friend's
large and happy home-circle.</p>

<p>"But she's a noble, unselfish woman,"
sobbed Mrs. Johnson, "and she taught
Jackanapes to be the same; and that's
how it is that my Tony has been spared
to me. And it must be sheer goodness
in Miss Jessamine, for what can she know
of a mother's feelings? And I'm sure
most people seem to think that if you've
a large family you don't know one from
another any more than they do, and that
a lot of children are like a lot of store
apples,&mdash;if one's taken it won't be
missed."</p>

<p>Lollo&mdash;the first Lollo, the Gypsy's
Lollo&mdash;very aged, draws Miss Jessamine's
bath-chair slowly up and down
the Goose Green in the sunshine.</p>

<p>The Ex-postman walks beside him,
which Lollo tolerates to the level of his
shoulder. If the Postman advances any
nearer to his head, Lollo quickens his
pace; and were the Postman to persist
in the injudicious attempt, there is, as
Miss Jessamine says, no knowing what
might happen.</p>

<p>In the opinion of the Goose Green,
Miss Jessamine has borne her troubles
"wonderfully." Indeed, to-day, some
of the less delicate and less intimate of
those who see everything from the upper
windows say (well, behind her back)
that "the old lady seems quite lively with
her military beaux again."</p>

<p>The meaning of this is, that Captain
Johnson is leaning over one side of her
chair, while by the other bends a brother
officer who is staying with him, and who
has manifested an extraordinary interest
in Lollo. He bends lower and lower,
and Miss Jessamine calls to the Postman
to request Lollo to be kind enough to
stop, while she is fumbling for something
which always hangs by her side, and has
got entangled with her spectacles.</p>

<p>It is a twopenny trumpet, bought
years ago in the village fair; and over it
she and Captain Johnson tell, as best
they can, between them, the story of
Jackanapes's ride across the Goose Green;
and how he won Lollo&mdash;the Gypsy's
Lollo&mdash;the racer Lollo&mdash;dear Lollo&mdash;faithful
Lollo&mdash;Lollo the never vanquished&mdash;Lollo
the tender servant of his
old mistress. And Lollo's ears twitch
at every mention of his name.</p>

<p>Their hearer does not speak, but he
never moves his eyes from the trumpet;
and when the tale is told, he lifts Miss
Jessamine's hand and presses his heavy
black moustache in silence to her trembling
fingers.</p>

<p>The sun, setting gently to his rest,
embroiders the somber foliage of the oak
tree with threads of gold. The Gray
Goose is sensible of an atmosphere of
repose, and puts up one leg for the night.
The grass glows with a more vivid green,
and, in answer to a ringing call from
Tony, his sisters fluttering over the
daisies in pale-hued muslins, come out
of their ever-open door, like pretty
pigeons from a dovecote.</p>

<p>And if the good gossips' eyes do not
deceive them, all the Miss Johnsons and
both the officers go wandering off into
the lanes, where bryony wreaths still
twine about the brambles.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A sorrowful story, and ending badly?</p>

<p>Nay, Jackanapes, for the End is not yet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>A life wasted that might have been
useful?</p>

<p>Men who have died for men, in all
ages, forgive the thought!</p>

<p>There is a heritage of heroic example
and noble obligation, not reckoned in
the Wealth of Nations, but essential to
a nation's life; the contempt of which, in
any people, may, not slowly, mean even
its commercial fall.</p>

<p>Very sweet are the uses of prosperity,
the harvests of peace and progress, the
fostering sunshine of health and happiness,
and length of days in the land.</p>

<p>But there be things&mdash;oh, sons of what
has deserved the name of Great Britain,
forget it not!&mdash;"the good of" which and
"the use of" which are beyond all calculation
of worldly goods and earthly
uses: things such as Love, and Honor,
and the Soul of Man, which cannot be
bought with a price, and which do not
die with death. And they who would
fain live happily ever after should not
leave these things out of the lessons of
their lives.</p>

<div class="hang1">The story that follows was first published in
<i>Harper's Round Table</i>, June 25, 1895, as
the winner of first place in a short story
contest conducted by that periodical. The
author at that time was seventeen years
of age. It seems quite fitting that a writer
beginning his career in such fashion should
finally write the most scholarly historical
and critical account of the development of
the short story, <i>The Short Story in English</i>
(1909). Mr. Canby was for several years
assistant professor of English in the Sheffield

<h4><br />BETTY'S RIDE: A TALE OF
THE REVOLUTION</h4>

<div class='center'>HENRY S. CANBY</div>

<p>The sun was just rising and showering
his first rays on the gambrel-roof and
solid stone walls of a house surrounded
by a magnificent grove of walnuts, and
overlooking one of the beautiful valleys
so common in southeastern Pennsylvania.
Close by the house, and shaded by the
same great trees, stood a low building of
the most severe type, whose time-stained
bricks and timbers green with moss told
its age without the aid of the half-obliterated
inscription over the door,
which read, "Built A. D. 1720." One
familiar with the country would have pronounced
it without hesitation a Quaker
meeting-house, dating back almost to
the time of William Penn.</p>

<p>When Ezra Dale had become the
leader of the little band of Quakers
which gathered here every First Day,
he had built the house under the walnut-trees,
and had taken his wife Ann and
his little daughter Betty to live there.
That was in 1770, seven years earlier,
and before war had wrought sorrow and
desolation throughout the country.</p>

<p>The sun rose higher, and just as his
beams touched the broad stone step in
front of the house the door opened, and
Ann Dale, a sweet-faced woman in the
plain Quaker garb, came out, followed
by Betty, a little blue-eyed Quakeress
of twelve years, with a gleam of spirit
in her face which ill became her plain
dress.</p>

<p>"Betty," said her mother, as they
walked out towards the great horse-block
by the road-side, "thee must keep
house to-day. Friend Robert has just
sent thy father word that the redcoats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
have not crossed the Brandywine since
Third Day last, and thy father and I
will ride to Chester to-day, that there
may be other than corn-cakes and bacon
for the friends who come to us after
monthly meeting. Mind thee keeps near
the house and finishes thy sampler."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," said Betty; "but will
thee not come home early? I shall miss
thee sadly."</p>

<p>Just then Ezra appeared, wearing his
collarless Quaker coat, and leading a
horse saddled with a great pillion, into
which Ann laboriously climbed after her
husband, and with a final warning and
"farewell" to Betty, clasped him tightly
around the waist lest she should be jolted
off as they jogged down the rough and
winding lane into the broad Chester
highway.</p>

<p>Friend Ann had many reasons for
fearing to leave Betty alone for a whole
day, and she looked back anxiously at her
waving "farewell" with her little bonnet.</p>

<p>It was a troublous time.</p>

<p>The Revolution was at its height, and
the British, who had a short time before
disembarked their army near Elkton,
Maryland, were now encamped near
White Clay Creek, while Washington
occupied the country bordering on the
Brandywine. His force, however, was
small compared to the extent of the
country to be guarded, and bands of the
British sometimes crossed the Brandywine
and foraged in the fertile counties
of Delaware and Chester. As Betty's
father, although a Quaker and a non-combatant,
was known to be a patriot,
he had to suffer the fortunes of war
with his neighbors.</p>

<p>Thus it was with many forebodings
that Betty's mother watched the slight
figure under the spreading branches of
a great chestnut, which seemed to rustle
its innumerable leaves as if to promise
protection to the little maid. However,
the sun shone brightly, the swallows
chirped as they circled overhead, and
nothing seemed farther off than battle
and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Betty skipped merrily into the house,
and snatching up some broken corn-cake
left from the morning meal, ran
lightly out to the paddock where Daisy
was kept, her own horse, which she had
helped to raise from a colt.</p>

<p>"Come thee here, Daisy," she said,
as she seated herself on the top rail of
the mossy snake fence. "Come thee
here, and thee shall have some of thy
mistress's corn-cake. Ah! I thought thee
would like it. Now go and eat all thee
can of this good grass, for if the wicked
redcoats come again, thee will not have
another chance, I can tell thee."</p>

<p>Daisy whinnied and trotted off, while
Betty, feeding the few chickens (sadly
reduced in numbers by numerous raids),
returned to the house, and getting her
sampler, sat down under a walnut-tree
to sew on the stint which her mother had
given her.</p>

<p>All was quiet save the chattering of
the squirrels overhead and the drowsy
hum of the bees, when from around the
curve in the road she heard a shot; then
another nearer, and then a voice shouting
commands, and the thud of hoof-beats
farther down the valley. She jumped
up with a startled cry: "The redcoats!
The redcoats! Oh, what shall I do!"</p>

<p>Just then the foremost of a scattered
band of soldiers, their buff and blue
uniforms and ill-assorted arms showing
them to be Americans, appeared in full
flight around the curve in the road,
and springing over the fence, dashed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
across the pasture straight for the
meeting-house. Through the broad gateway
they poured, and forcing open the
door of the meeting-house, rushed within
and began to barricade the windows.</p>

<p>Their leader paused while his men
passed in, and seeing Betty, came quickly
towards her.</p>

<p>"What do you here, child?" he said,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hurridly'">hurriedly</ins>. "Go quickly, before the British
reach us, and tell your father that,
Quaker or no Quaker, he shall ride to
Washington, on the Brandywine, and
tell him that we, but one hundred men,
are besieged by three hundred British
cavalry in Chichester Meeting-house,
with but little powder left. Tell him
to make all haste to us."</p>

<p>Turning, he hastened into the meeting-house,
now converted into a fort, and
as the doors closed behind him Betty
saw a black muzzle protruding from
every window.</p>

<p>With trembling fingers the little maid
picked up her sampler, and as the thud
of horses' hoofs grew louder and louder,
she ran fearfully into the house, locked
and bolted the massive door, and then
flying up the broad stairs, she seated
herself in a little window overlooking
the meeting-house yard. She had gone
into the house none too soon. Up the
road, with their red coats gleaming and
their harness jangling, was sweeping a
detachment of British cavalry, never
stopping until they reached the meeting-house&mdash;and
then it was too late.</p>

<p>A sheet of flame shot out from the
wall before them, and half a dozen
troopers fell lifeless to the ground, and
half a dozen riderless horses galloped
wildly down the road. The leader
shouted a sharp command, and the
whole troop retreated in confusion.</p>

<p>Betty drew back shuddering, and
when she brought herself to look again
the troopers had dismounted, had surrounded
the meeting-house, and were
pouring volley after volley at its doors
and windows. Then for the first time
Betty thought of the officer's message,
and remembered that the safety of the
Americans depended upon her alone,
for her father was away, no neighbor
within reach, and without powder she
knew they could not resist long.</p>

<p>Could she save them? All her stern
Quaker blood rose at the thought, and
stealing softly to the paddock behind
the barn, she saddled Daisy and led her
through the bars into the wood road,
which opened into the highway just
around the bend. Could she but pass
the pickets without discovery there would
be little danger of pursuit; then there
would be only the long ride of eight
miles ahead of her.</p>

<p>Just before the narrow wood road
joined the broader highway Betty
mounted Daisy by means of a convenient
stump, and starting off at a gallop, had
just turned the corner when a voice
shouted "Halt!" and a shot whistled
past her head. Betty screamed with
terror, and bending over, brought down
her riding-whip with all her strength
upon Daisy, then, turning for a moment,
saw three troopers hurriedly mounting.</p>

<p>Her heart sank within her, but,
beginning to feel the excitement of the
chase, she leaned over and patting
Daisy on the neck, encouraged her to
do her best. Onward they sped. Betty,
her curly hair streaming in the wind, the
color now mounting to, now retreating
from her cheeks, led by five hundred yards.</p>

<p>But Daisy had not been used for weeks,
and already felt the unusual strain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
Now they thundered over Naaman's
Creek, now over Concord, with the
nearest pursuer only four hundred yards
behind; and now they raced beside the
clear waters of Beaver Brook, and as
Betty dashed through its shallow ford,
the thud of horse's hoofs seemed just
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Betty, at first sure of success, now
knew that unless in some way she could
throw her pursuers off her track she
was surely lost. Just then she saw
ahead of her a fork in the road, the
lower branch leading to the Brandywine,
the upper to the Birmingham
Meeting-house. Could she but get the
troopers on the upper road while she
took the lower, she would be safe; and,
as if in answer to her wish, there flashed
across her mind the remembrance of the
old cross-road which, long disused, and
with its entrance hidden by drooping
boughs, led from a point in the upper road
just out of sight of the fork down across
the lower, and through the valley of the
Brandywine. Could she gain this road
unseen she still might reach Washington.</p>

<p>Urging Daisy forward, she broke just
in time through the dense growth which
hid the entrance, and sat trembling,
hidden behind a dense growth of tangled
vines, while she heard the troopers
thunder by. Then, riding through the
rustling woods, she came at last into
the open, and saw spread out beneath
her the beautiful valley of the Brandywine,
dotted with the white tents of the
Continental army.</p>

<p>Starting off at a gallop, she dashed
around a bend in the road into the
midst of a group of officers riding slowly
up from the valley.</p>

<p>"Stop, little maiden, before you run
us down," said one, who seemed to be
in command. "Where are you going
in such hot haste?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," said Betty, reining in Daisy,
"can thee tell me where I can find
General Washington?"</p>

<p>"Yes, little Quakeress," said the officer
who had first spoken to her; "I am he.
What do you wish?"</p>

<p>Betty, too exhausted to be surprised,
poured forth her story in a few broken
sentences, and (hearing as if in a dream
the hasty commands for the rescue of
the soldiers in Chichester Meeting-house)
fell forward in her saddle, and, for the
first time in her life, fainted, worn out
by her noble ride.</p>

<p>A few days later, when recovering
from the shock of her long and eventful
ride, Betty, awaking from a deep sleep,
found her mother kneeling beside her
little bed, while her father talked with
General Washington himself beside the
fireplace; and it was the proudest and
happiest moment of her life when
Washington, coming forward and taking
her by the hand, said, "You are the
bravest little maid in America, and an
honor to your country."</p>

<p>Still the peaceful meeting-house and the
gambrel-roofed home stand unchanged,
save that their time-beaten timbers and
crumbling bricks have taken on a more
sombre tinge, and under the broad walnut-tree
another little Betty sits and sews.</p>

<p>If you ask it, she will take down the
great key from its nail, and swinging
back the new doors of the meeting-house,
will show you the old worm-eaten ones
inside, which, pierced through and
through with bullet-holes, once served
as a rampart against the enemy. And
she will tell you, in the quaint Friend's
language, how her great-great-grandmother
carried, over a hundred years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
ago, the news of the danger of her countrymen
to Washington, on the Brandywine,
and at the risk of her own life
saved theirs.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_384" id="Note_384">384</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Some two decades ago thousands were reading
about the highly romantic career of
Charles Brandon in <i>When Knighthood Was
in Flower</i> (1898), and other thousands were
applauding Julia Marlowe's impersonation
of the beautiful and fascinating Princess
Mary in the dramatic version of that book.
The author was Charles Major (1856-1913),
an Indiana lawyer turned novelist, who
wrote, also, the equally romantic story of
<i>Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall</i> (1902).
Between these two pieces of delightful
romance, he wrote a series of sketches of
pioneer life in Indiana under the title of
<i>The Bears of Blue River</i> (1901). It is an
account of boy life in the early days, full
of dramatic interest, simply written, and
entirely worthy of the high place which it
has already taken among stories of its
type. The first adventure in that book
follows by special arrangement with the
publishers. (Copyright. The Macmillan
Company, New York.)</div>


<h4><br />THE BIG BEAR</h4>

<div class='center'>CHARLES MAJOR</div>

<p>Away back in the "twenties," when
Indiana was a baby state, and great
forests of tall trees and tangled underbrush
darkened what are now her bright
plains and sunny hills, there stood upon
the east bank of Big Blue River, a mile or
two north of the point where that stream
crosses the Michigan road, a cozy log cabin
of two rooms&mdash;one front and one back.</p>

<p>The house faced the west, and stretching
off toward the river for a distance
equal to twice the width of an ordinary
street, was a blue-grass lawn, upon which
stood a dozen or more elm and sycamore
trees, with a few honey-locusts scattered
here and there. Immediately at the
water's edge was a steep slope of ten or
twelve feet. Back of the house, mile
upon mile, stretched the deep dark
forest, inhabited by deer and bears,
wolves and wildcats, squirrels and birds,
without number.</p>

<p>In the river the fish were so numerous
that they seemed to entreat the boys to
catch them, and to take them out of
their crowded quarters. There were
bass and black suckers, sunfish and catfish,
to say nothing of the sweetest of
all, the big-mouthed redeye.</p>

<p>South of the house stood a log barn,
with room in it for three horses and two
cows; and enclosing this barn, together
with a piece of ground, five or six acres
in extent, was a palisade fence, eight or
ten feet high, made by driving poles
into the ground close together. In this
enclosure the farmer kept his stock, consisting
of a few sheep and cattle, and
here also the chickens, geese, and ducks
were driven at nightfall to save them
from "varmints," as all prowling animals
were called by the settlers.</p>

<p>The man who had built this log hut,
and who lived in it and owned the
adjoining land at the time of which I
write, bore the name of Balser Brent.
"Balser" is probably a corruption of
Baltzer, but, however that may be,
Balser was his name, and Balser was the
hero of the bear stories which I am
about to tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. Brent and his young wife had
moved to the Blue River settlement
from North Carolina, when young Balser
was a little boy five or six years of age.
They had purchased the "eighty" upon
which they lived, from the United States,
at a sale of public land held in the town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
of Brookville on Whitewater, and had
paid for it what was then considered a
good round sum&mdash;one dollar per acre.
They had received a deed for their
"eighty" from no less a person than
James Monroe, then President of the
United States. This deed, which is
called a patent, was written on sheepskin,
signed by the President's own hand,
and is still preserved by the descendants
of Mr. Brent as one of the title-deeds to
the land it conveyed. The house, as I
have told you, consisted of two large
rooms, or buildings, separated by a
passageway six or eight feet broad which
was roofed over, but open at both ends&mdash;on
the north and south. The back room
was the kitchen, and the front room was
parlor, bedroom, sitting room and library
all in one.</p>

<p>At the time when my story opens
Little Balser, as he was called to distinguish
him from his father, was thirteen
or fourteen years of age, and was the
happy possessor of a younger brother,
Jim, aged nine, and a little sister one year
old, of whom he was very proud indeed.</p>

<p>On the south side of the front room
was a large fireplace. The chimney was
built of sticks, thickly covered with clay.
The fireplace was almost as large as a
small room in one of our cramped modern
houses, and was broad and deep enough
to take in backlogs which were so large
and heavy that they could not be lifted,
but were drawn in at the door and rolled
over the floor to the fireplace.</p>

<p>The prudent father usually kept two
extra backlogs, one on each side of the fireplace,
ready to be rolled in as the blaze
died down; and on these logs the children
would sit at night, with a rough slate made
from a flat stone, and do their "ciphering,"
as the study of arithmetic was then
called. The fire usually furnished all the
light they had, for candles and "dips,"
being expensive luxuries, were used only
when company was present.</p>

<p>The fire, however, gave sufficient light,
and its blaze upon a cold night extended
halfway up the chimney, sending a ruddy,
cozy glow to every nook and corner of
the room.</p>

<p>The back room was the storehouse
and kitchen; and from the beams and
along the walls hung rich hams and
juicy sidemeat, jerked venison, dried
apples, onions, and other provisions for
the winter. There was a glorious fireplace
in this room also, and a crane upon
which to hang pots and cooking utensils.</p>

<p>The floor of the front room was made
of logs split in halves with the flat, hewn
side up; but the floor of the kitchen
was of clay, packed hard and smooth.</p>

<p>The settlers had no stoves, but did
their cooking in round pots called Dutch
ovens. They roasted their meats on a
spit or steel bar like the ramrod of a
gun. The spit was kept turning before
the fire, presenting first one side of the
meat and then the other, until it was
thoroughly cooked. Turning the spit
was the children's work.</p>

<p>South of the palisade enclosing the
barn was the clearing&mdash;a tract of twenty
or thirty acres of land, from which Mr.
Brent had cut and burned the trees.
On this clearing the stumps stood thick
as the hair on an angry dog's back;
but the hard-working farmer ploughed
between and around them, and each
year raised upon the fertile soil enough
wheat and corn to supply the wants of
his family and his stock, and still had a
little grain left to take to Brookville,
sixty miles away, where he had bought
his land, there to exchange for such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
necessities of life as could not be grown
upon the farm or found in the forests.</p>

<p>The daily food of the family all came
from the farm, the forest, or the creek.
Their sugar was obtained from the sap
of the sugar-trees; their meat was supplied
in the greatest abundance by a
few hogs, and by the inexhaustible game
of which the forests were full. In the
woods were found deer just for the
shooting; and squirrels, rabbits, wild
turkeys, pheasants, and quails, so
numerous that a few hours' hunting
would supply the table for days. The
fish in the river, as I told you, fairly
longed to be caught.</p>

<p>One day Mrs. Brent took down the
dinner horn and blew upon it two strong
blasts. This was a signal that Little
Balser, who was helping his father down
in the clearing, should come to the
house. Balser was glad enough to drop
his hoe and to run home. When he
reached the house his mother said:</p>

<p>"Balser, go up to the drift and catch
a mess of fish for dinner. Your father
is tired of deer meat three times a day,
and I know he would like a nice dish of
fried redeyes at noon."</p>

<p>"All right, mother," said Balser. And
he immediately took down his fishing-pole
and line, and got the spade to dig bait.
When he had collected a small gourdful
of angle-worms, his mother called to him:</p>

<p>"You had better take a gun. You
may meet a bear; your father loaded
the gun this morning, and you must be
careful in handling it."</p>

<p>Balser took the gun, which was a
heavy rifle considerably longer than himself,
and started up the river toward the
drift, about a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>There had been rain during the night
and the ground near the drift was soft.</p>

<p>Here, Little Balser noticed fresh bear
tracks, and his breath began to come
quickly. You may be sure he peered
closely into every dark thicket, and
looked behind all the large trees and
logs, and had his eyes wide open lest
perchance "Mr. Bear" should step out
and surprise him with an affectionate
hug, and thereby put an end to Little
Balser forever.</p>

<p>So he walked on cautiously, and, if
the truth must be told, somewhat
tremblingly, until he reached the drift.</p>

<p>Balser was but a little fellow, yet the
stern necessities of a settler's life had
compelled his father to teach him the use
of a gun; and although Balser had never
killed a bear, he had shot several deer,
and upon one occasion had killed a wildcat,
"almost as big as a cow," he said.</p>

<p>I have no doubt the wildcat seemed
"almost as big as a cow" to Balser when
he killed it, for it must have frightened
him greatly, as wildcats were sometimes
dangerous animals for children to
encounter. Although Balser had never
met a bear face to face and alone, yet he
felt, and many a time had said, that there
wasn't a bear in the world big enough
to frighten him, if he but had his gun.</p>

<p>He had often imagined and minutely
detailed to his parents and little brother
just what he would do if he should meet
a bear. He would wait calmly and
quietly until his bearship should come
within a few yards of him, and then
he would slowly lift his gun. Bang!
and Mr. Bear would be dead with a
bullet in his heart.</p>

<p>But when he saw the fresh bear tracks,
and began to realize that he would
probably have an opportunity to put
his theories about bear killing into
practice, he began to wonder if, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
all, he would become frightened and
miss his aim. Then he thought of how
the bear, in that case, would be calm
and deliberate, and would put <i>his</i>
theories into practice by walking very
politely up to him, and making a very
satisfactory dinner of a certain boy whom
he could name. But as he walked on
and no bear appeared, his courage grew
stronger as the prospect of meeting the
enemy grew less, and he again began
saying to himself that no bear could
frighten him, because he had his gun
and he could and would kill it.</p>

<p>So Balser reached the drift; and having
looked carefully about him, leaned
his gun against a tree, unwound his
fishing-line from the pole, and walked
out to the end of a log which extended
into the river some twenty or thirty feet.</p>

<p>Here he threw in his line, and soon was
so busily engaged drawing out sunfish
and redeyes, and now and then a bass,
which was hungry enough to bite at a
worm, that all thought of the bear went
out of his mind.</p>

<p>After he had caught enough fish for
a sumptuous dinner he bethought him
of going home, and as he turned toward
the shore, imagine, if you can, his consternation
when he saw upon the bank,
quietly watching him, a huge black bear.</p>

<p>If the wildcat had seemed as large as
a cow to Balser, of what size do you
suppose that bear appeared? A cow!
An elephant, surely, was small compared
with the huge black fellow standing upon
the bank.</p>

<p>It is true Balser had never seen an
elephant, but his father had, and so
had his friend Tom Fox, who lived
down the river; and they all agreed that
an elephant was "purt nigh as big as
all outdoors."</p>

<p>The bear had a peculiar, determined
expression about him that seemed to say:</p>

<p>"That boy can't get away; he's out
on the log where the water is deep, and
if he jumps into the river I can easily
jump in after him and catch him before
he can swim a dozen strokes. He'll
<i>have</i> to come off the log in a short time,
and then I'll proceed to devour him."</p>

<p>About the same train of thought had
also been rapidly passing through Balser's
mind. His gun was on the bank where
he had left it, and in order to reach it
he would have to pass the bear. He
dared not jump into the water, for any
attempt to escape on his part would
bring the bear upon him instantly. He
was very much frightened, but, after all,
was a cool-headed little fellow for his
age; so he concluded that he would not
press matters, as the bear did not seem
inclined to do so, but so long as the bear
remained watching him on the bank
would stay upon the log where he was,
and allow the enemy to eye him to his
heart's content.</p>

<p>There they stood, the boy and the
bear, each eyeing the other as though
they were the best of friends, and would
like to eat each other, which, in fact,
was literally true.</p>

<p>Time sped very slowly for one of them,
you may be sure; and it seemed to
Balser that he had been standing almost
an age in the middle of Blue River on
that wretched shaking log, when he heard
his mother's dinner horn, reminding him
that it was time to go home.</p>

<p>Balser quite agreed with his mother
and gladly would he have gone, I need
not tell you; but there stood the bear,
patient, determined, and fierce; and
Little Balser soon was convinced in his
mind that his time had come to die.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span></p>

<p>He hoped that when his father should
go home to dinner and find him still
absent, he would come up the river in
search of him, and frighten away the
bear. Hardly had this hope sprung up
in his mind, when it seemed that the
same thought had also occurred to the
bear, for he began to move down toward
the shore end of the log upon which
Balser was standing.</p>

<p>Slowly came the bear until he reached
the end of the log, which for a moment
he examined suspiciously, and then, to
Balser's great alarm, cautiously stepped
out upon it and began to walk toward
him.</p>

<p>Balser thought of the folks at home,
and, above all, of his baby sister; and
when he felt that he should never see
them again, and that they would in all
probability never know of his fate, he
began to grow heavy-hearted and was
almost paralyzed with fear.</p>

<p>On came the bear, putting one great
paw in front of the other, and watching
Balser intently with his little black eyes.
His tongue hung out, and his great red
mouth was open to its widest, showing
the sharp, long, glittering teeth that
would soon be feasting on a first-class
boy dinner.</p>

<p>When the bear got within a few feet
of Balser&mdash;so close he could almost feel
the animal's hot breath as it slowly
approached&mdash;the boy grew desperate with
fear, and struck at the bear with the
only weapon he had&mdash;his string of fish.</p>

<p>Now, bears love fish and blackberries
above all other food; so when Balser's
string of fish struck the bear in the mouth,
he grabbed at them, and in doing so
lost his foothold on the slippery log and
fell into the water with a great splash
and plunge.</p>

<p>This was Balser's chance for life, so
he flung the fish to the bear, and ran
for the bank with a speed worthy of
the cause.</p>

<p>When he reached the bank his self-confidence
returned, and he remembered
all the things he had said he would do
if he should meet a bear.</p>

<p>The bear had caught the fish, and
again had climbed upon the log, where
he was deliberately devouring them.</p>

<p>This was Little Balser's chance for
death&mdash;to the bear. Quickly snatching
up the gun, he rested it in the fork of a
small tree near by, took deliberate aim
at the bear, which was not five yards
away, and shot him through the heart.
The bear dropped into the water dead,
and floated downstream a little way,
where he lodged at a ripple a short
distance below.</p>

<p>Balser, after he had killed the bear,
became more frightened than he had
been at any time during the adventure,
and ran home screaming. That afternoon
his father went to the scene of battle
and took the bear out of the water. It
was very fat and large, and weighed, so
Mr. Brent said, over six hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Balser was firmly of the opinion that
he himself was also very fat and large,
and weighed at least as much as the bear.
He was certainly entitled to feel "big";
for he had got himself out of an ugly
scrape in a brave, manly, and cool-headed
manner, and had achieved a victory
of which a man might have been
proud.</p>

<p>The news of Balser's adventure soon
spread among the neighbors and he
became quite a hero; for the bear he
had killed was one of the largest that
had ever been seen in that neighborhood,
and, besides the gallons of rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
bear oil it yielded, there were three or
four hundred pounds of bear meat; and
no other food is more strengthening for
winter diet.</p>

<p>There was also the soft, furry skin,
which Balser's mother tanned, and with
it made a coverlid for Balser's bed, under
which he and his little brother lay many
a cold night, cozy and "snug as a bug
in a rug."</p>

<div class="hang1">The selection that follows may serve as an
example of an effective Christmas story in
the latest fashion. It was not written
especially for young people, but neither
were many of the books that now stand
on the shelf that holds their favorites. It
is not only one of the great short stories,
but one of the shortest of great-stories. It
is quite worthy of use in company with
Dickens' <i>Christmas Carol</i>, Henry van
Dyke's <i>The Other Wise Man</i>, and Thomas
Nelson Page's <i>Santa Claus's Partner</i>, at
the Christmas season, and it has the advantages
of extreme brevity, a fresh breeziness
of style, surprise in the plot, and romantic
interest. The magi brought various gifts
to the Child in the manger&mdash;gold, frankincense,
myrrh&mdash;but only one gift, that of
love. O. Henry does not often moralize,
but no reader ever finds fault with his
concluding paragraph. The author's real
name was William Sidney Porter. He was
born in Greensboro, N. C., in 1862, and
died in New York City, in 1910, the most
widely read of short-story writers. "The
Gift of the Magi" is taken from the volume
called <i>The Four Million</i> by special arrangement
with the publishers. (Copyright,
Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. New York.)</div>


<h4><br />THE GIFT OF THE MAGI</h4>

<div class='center'>O. HENRY</div>

<p>One dollar and eighty-seven cents.
That was all. And sixty cents of it
was in pennies. Pennies saved one and
two at a time by bulldozing the grocer
and the vegetable man and the butcher
until one's cheeks burned with the silent
imputation of parsimony that such close
dealing implied. Three times Della
counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven
cents. And the next day would
be Christmas.</p>

<p>There was clearly nothing to do but
flop down on the shabby little couch
and howl. So Della did it. Which
instigates the moral reflection that life
is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles,
with sniffles predominating.</p>

<p>While the mistress of the home is
gradually subsiding from the first stage
to the second, take a look at the home.
A furnished flat at $8.00 per week. It
did not exactly beggar description, but
it certainly had that word on the lookout
for the mendicancy squad.</p>

<p>In the vestibule below was a letter-box
into which no letter would go, and an
electric button from which no mortal
finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining
thereunto was a card bearing the
name "Mr. James Dillingham Young."</p>

<p>The "Dillingham" had been flung to
the breeze during a former period of
prosperity when its possessor was being
paid $30 per week. Now, when the
income was shrunk to $20, the letters
of "Dillingham" looked blurred, as
though they were thinking seriously of
contracting to a modest and unassuming
D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham
Young came home and reached his
flat above he was called "Jim" and
greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham
Young, already introduced to you
as Della. Which is all very good.</p>

<p>Della finished her cry and attended
to her cheeks with the powder rag. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
stood by the window and looked out
dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence
in a grey backyard. Tomorrow would
be Christmas Day, and she had only
$1.87 with which to buy Jim a present.
She had been saving every penny she
could for months, with this result.
Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far.
Expenses had been greater than she had
calculated. They always are. Only
$1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her
Jim. Many a happy hour she had
spent planning for something nice for
him. Something fine and rare and
sterling&mdash;something just a little bit
near to being worthy of the honor of
being owned by Jim.</p>

<p>There was a pier-glass between the
windows of the room. Perhaps you
have seen a pier-glass in an $8.00 flat.
A very thin and very agile person may,
by observing his reflection in a rapid
sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain
a fairly accurate conception of his looks.
Della, being slender, had mastered the art.</p>

<p>Suddenly she whirled from the window
and stood before the glass. Her eyes
were shining brilliantly, but her face
had lost its color within twenty seconds.
Rapidly she pulled down her hair and
let it fall to its full length.</p>

<p>Now, there were two possessions of
the James Dillingham Youngs in which
they both took a mighty pride. One
was Jim's gold watch that had been
his father's and his grandfather's. The
other was Della's hair. Had the Queen
of Sheba lived in the flat across the
airshaft, Della would have let her hair
hang out the window some day to dry
just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels
and gifts. Had King Solomon been
the janitor, with all his treasures piled
up in the basement, Jim would have
pulled out his watch every time he passed,
just to see him pluck at his beard from
envy.</p>

<p>So now Della's beautiful hair fell
about her, rippling and shining like a
cascade of brown waters. It reached
below her knee and made itself almost
a garment for her. And then she did
it up again nervously and quickly. Once
she faltered for a minute and stood still
while a tear or two splashed on the
worn red carpet.</p>

<p>On went her old brown jacket; on
went her old brown hat. With a whirl
of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle
still in her eyes, she fluttered out the
door and down the stairs to the street.</p>

<p>Where she stopped the sign read:
"Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All
Kinds." One flight up Della ran, and
collected herself, panting. Madame,
large, too white, chilly, hardly looked
the "Sofronie."</p>

<p>"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della.</p>

<p>"I buy hair," said Madame. "Take
yer hat off and let's have a sight at the
looks of it."</p>

<p>Down rippled the brown cascade.</p>

<p>"Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting
the mass with a practised hand.</p>

<p>"Give it to me quick," said Della.</p>

<p>Oh, and the next two hours tripped by
on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor.
She was ransacking the stores
for Jim's present.</p>

<p>She found it at last. It surely had
been made for Jim and no one else.
There was no other like it in any of the
stores, and she had turned all of them
inside out. It was a platinum fob chain
simple and chaste in design, properly
proclaiming its value by substance alone
and not by meretricious ornamentation&mdash;as
all good things should do. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
even worthy of The Watch. As soon
as she saw it she knew that it must be
Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and
value&mdash;the description applied to both.
Twenty-one dollars they took from her
for it, and she hurried home with the
87 cents. With that chain on his watch
Jim might be properly anxious about the
time in any company. Grand as the
watch was, he sometimes looked at it
on the sly on account of the old leather
strap that he used in place of a chain.</p>

<p>When Della reached home her intoxication
gave way a little to prudence and
reason. She got out her curling irons and
lighted the gas and went to work repairing
the ravages made by generosity added
to love. Which is always a tremendous
task, dear friends&mdash;a mammoth task.</p>

<p>Within forty minutes her head was
covered with tiny, close-lying curls that
made her look wonderfully like a truant
schoolboy. She looked at her reflection
in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.</p>

<p>"If Jim doesn't kill me," she said to
herself, "before he takes a second look
at me, he'll say I look like a Coney
Island chorus girl. But what could I
do&mdash;oh! what could I do with a dollar
and eighty-seven cents?"</p>

<p>At 7 o'clock the coffee was made and
the frying pan was on the back of the
stove hot and ready to cook the chops.</p>

<p>Jim was never late. Della doubled
the fob chain in her hand and sat on the
corner of the table near the door that
he always entered. Then she heard his
step on the stair away down on the first
flight, and she turned white for just a
moment. She had a habit of saying
little silent prayers about the simplest
everyday things, and now she whispered;
"Please God, make him think I am still
pretty."</p>

<p>The door opened and Jim stepped
in and closed it. He looked thin and
very serious. Poor fellow, he was only
twenty-two&mdash;and to be burdened with
a family! He needed a new overcoat
and he was without gloves.</p>

<p>Jim stopped inside the door, as immovable
as a setter at the scent of quail.
His eyes were fixed upon Della, and
there was an expression in them that
she could not read, and it terrified her.
It was not anger, nor surprise, nor
disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the
sentiments that she had been prepared
for. He simply stared at her fixedly
with that peculiar expression on his face.</p>

<p>Della wriggled off the table and went
for him.</p>

<p>"Jim, darling," she cried, "don't look
at me that way. I had my hair cut off
and sold it because I couldn't have
lived through Christmas without giving
you a present. It'll grow out again&mdash;
you won't mind, will you? I just had
to do it. My hair grows awfully fast.
Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's
be happy. You don't know what a nice&mdash;what
a beautiful, nice gift I've got
for you."</p>

<p>"You've cut off your hair?" asked
Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived
at that patent fact yet even after the
hardest mental labor.</p>

<p>"Cut it off and sold it," said Della.
"Don't you like me just as well, anyhow?
I'm me without my hair, ain't I?"</p>

<p>Jim looked about the room curiously.</p>

<p>"You say your hair is gone?" he said,
with an air almost of idiocy.</p>

<p>"You needn't look for it," said Della.
"It's sold, I tell you&mdash;sold and gone,
too. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good
to me, for it went for you. Maybe the
hairs of my head were numbered," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
went on with a sudden serious sweetness,
"but nobody could ever count my
love for you. Shall I put the chops on,
Jim?"</p>

<p>Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly
to wake. He enfolded his Della. For
ten seconds let us regard with discreet
scrutiny some inconsequential object in
the other direction. Eight dollars a
week or a million a year&mdash;what is the
difference? A mathematician or a wit
would give you the wrong answer. The
magi brought valuable gifts, but that
was not among them. This dark assertion
will be illuminated later on.</p>

<p>Jim drew a package from his overcoat
pocket and threw it upon the table.</p>

<p>"Don't make any mistake, Dell," he
said, "about me. I don't think there's
anything in the way of a haircut or a
shave or a shampoo that could make
me like my girl any less. But if you'll
unwrap that package you may see why
you had me going a while at first."</p>

<p>White fingers and nimble tore at the
string and paper. And then an ecstatic
scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick
feminine change to hysterical tears and
wails, necessitating the immediate employment
of all the comforting powers of the
lord of the flat.</p>

<p>For-there lay The Combs&mdash;the set
of combs, side and back, that Della
had worshipped for long in a Broadway
window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise
shell, with jewelled rims&mdash;just
the shade to wear in the beautiful
vanished hair. They were expensive
combs, she knew, and her heart had
simply craved and yearned over them
without the least hope of possession.
And now, they were hers, but the
tresses that should have adorned the
coveted adornments were gone.</p>

<p>But she hugged them to her bosom,
and at length she was able to look up
with dim eyes and a smile and say: "My
hair grows so fast, Jim!"</p>

<p>And then Della leaped up like a little
singed cat and cried, "Oh, oh!"</p>

<p>Jim had not yet seen his beautiful
present. She held it out to him
eagerly upon her open palm. The dull
precious metal seemed to flash with
a reflection of her bright and ardent
spirit.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted
all over town to find it. You'll have to
look at the time a hundred times a day
now. Give me your watch. I want to
see how it looks on it."</p>

<p>Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down
on the couch and put his hands under
the back of his head and smiled.</p>

<p>"Dell," said he, "let's put our Christmas
presents away and keep 'em a while.
They're too nice to use just at present.
I sold the watch to get the money to
buy your combs. And now suppose
you put the chops on."</p>

<p>The magi, as you know, were wise
men&mdash;wonderfully wise men&mdash;who
brought gifts to the Babe in the manger.
They invented the art of giving Christmas
presents. Being wise, their gifts
were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing
the privilege of exchange in case of
duplication. And here I have lamely
related to you the uneventful chronicle
of two foolish children in a flat who most
unwisely sacrificed for each other the
greatest treasures of their house. But
in a last word to the wise of these days
let it be said that of all who give gifts
these two were the wisest. Of all who
give and receive gifts, such as they are
wisest. Everywhere they are wisest.
They are the magi.</p>

<h2>SECTION IX. NATURE LITERATURE</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p><i>What it is.</i> In recent years teachers have heard much talk about "nature
study" in the grades. The demand for this study has led publishers to print many
so-called "nature books" that have neither scientific fact nor literary worth to justify
their existence. Confusion may be avoided and time may be saved if teachers will
remember that nature literature, as here defined, is a form of <i>literature</i>, and that its
purpose therefore is primarily to present truth (not necessarily facts) in an entertaining
way.</p>

<p>The selections in this section are not intended to furnish material for a scientific
study of nature. They are nature literature. Some of them present scientific facts
that add to the literary worth by making the stories more entertaining, but the
selections are given because they illustrate various types of nature literature and
the work of famous writers of nature literature, not because they present scientific
facts.</p>

<p><i>Some types of nature literature.</i> One of the oldest forms of nature literature is
the beast tale in which animals are represented as talking and acting like human
beings. Stories of this type entertain while they reveal the general nature of various
kinds of animals. Fables should not be called nature literature, because their chief
purpose is to criticize the follies of human beings. Some of the Negro folk tales that
Joel Chandler Harris collected are nature literature of this type. Beast tales, however,
are not all old. Stories by such modern authors as Thornton W. Burgess and
Albert Bigelow Paine, who are represented in this section, may be called beast tales.
They are popular in the primary grades.</p>

<p>Another type of nature literature, quite different from that just discussed, has
been produced during the last century by students of nature who endeavor to hold
strictly to facts in their writing. This may be called realistic nature literature.
Henry Thoreau, John Burroughs, Olive Thorne Miller, and Dallas Lore Sharp may
be mentioned as writers of this kind of literature. As we read their books, we usually
feel that they are endeavoring to relate incidents as they actually occurred.
Also we recognize that they are great students of nature, for they perceive details
that we might not notice and they draw or suggest conclusions that we may accept
as true, although we might never think of drawing the conclusions. Nature literature
of this kind may be no less entertaining than fairy tales, for it may, in a pleasing
way, reveal wonders in nature. The selections by Dallas Lore Sharp and Olive
Thorne Miller in this section are of this kind. Most of the writings of Henry Thoreau
and John Burroughs are in a style too difficult for pupils in the grades.</p>

<p>A third type may be called nature romance. Its purpose is both to entertain
and to awaken sympathy and love for animals. Stories of this kind, like
other romances, idealize the characters and may have a strong appeal to the emotions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>.
Of the stories in this section, we may classify as nature romance Beatrix Potter's
"Peter Rabbit," Sewell Ford's "Pasha, the Son of Selim," Ouida's "Moufflou,"
and Rudyard Kipling's "Moti Guj&mdash;Mutineer."</p>

<p>A fourth kind of nature literature, sometimes called nature fiction, has been
developed within the last quarter of a century and is already recognized as excellent.
The plot is created by the author, although it may be based on fact, and usually is
simple and rambling. One purpose of these stories is to show truly how animals
live and act, just as one purpose of a novel or typical short story is to show truly how
people live and act. If the author is a skillful story-teller and a good student of nature,
the story may make the reader feel that he has become acquainted with a particular
kind of animal and even with an individual animal. For example, the story "Last
Bull," by Charles G. D. Roberts, has an effect on the reader not entirely unlike that
of one of Cooper's <i>Leatherstocking Tales</i>. Prominent among the authors of this
very interesting and instructive form of literature may be mentioned Charles G. D.
Roberts, Ernest Thompson Seton, William J. Long, and Dallas Lore Sharp.</p>

<p><i>Its place in the grades.</i> Nature literature seems to have a place of increasing
importance in schools, especially in grades above the third. Many excellent books
of what we have called the fiction type and the realistic type have a charming spirit
of outdoor life and adventure that makes them pleasing substitutes for the objectionable
dime novel. One should not assume that these nature stories would be of
less interest and value to the country child than to the city child. Too often country
children have not been taught to think of animals as "little brothers of the field and
the air." These nature stories, without any spirit of preaching or moralizing, show
children how to enjoy nature, whether it be in the country or the city. They teach
the child to form habits of observation that encourage healthful recreation. A boy
who has understood the spirit of Roberts, Seton, and Sharp is not likely to find the
village poolroom attractive. Nature literature, however, need not be taught merely
for moral and practical purposes, for it has come to be literature of artistic worth,
and as such it has earned a place among other kinds of literature for children.</p>

<h3>SUGGESTIONS FOR READING</h3>
<div class='blockquot'><p>A good summary article is "The Rise of the Nature Writers," by F. W. Halsey, in <i>Review
of Reviews</i>, Vol. XXVI, p. 567 (November, 1902). The most valuable critical article is "The Literary
Treatment of Nature" in John Burroughs, <i>Ways of Nature</i> (also in <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, Vol. XCIV,
p. 38 [July, 1904]). In the violent controversy about "nature-faking" which raged some years ago,
two articles will give clearly the positions of the contending parties: first, the attack by John Burroughs
in "Real and Sham Natural History," <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, Vol. XCI, p. 298 (March, 1903),
and, second, the reply to Burroughs by William J. Long in "The School of Nature Study and Its
Critics," <i>North American Review</i>, Vol. CLXXVI, p. 688 (May, 1903).</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_386" id="Note_386">386</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">One of the most popular series for very
young children is that known as the <i>Peter
Rabbit Books</i> after the favorite hero of
the early tales. The author is Beatrix
Potter, an Englishwoman. In plan these
little books resemble the "toy-books" of
the eighteenth century in having a bit of
text on the left-hand page face a picture
on the right. The entire text of "The
Tale of Peter Rabbit" is given, but of
course text and pictures are so completely
one that much is lost by separating them.
Children should meet Peter Rabbit before
their school days begin.</div>


<h4><br />THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT</h4>

<div class='center'>BEATRIX POTTER</div>

<p>Once upon a time there were four
little Rabbits, and their names were
Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.</p>

<p>They lived with their mother in a
sand bank, underneath the root of a
very big fir tree.</p>

<p>"Now, my dears," said old Mrs. Rabbit
one morning, "you may go into the
fields or down the lane, but don't go
into Mr. McGregor's garden. Your
father had an accident there; he was
put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor. Now
run along, and don't get into mischief.
I am going out."</p>

<p>Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket
and her umbrella, and went through
the wood to the baker's. She bought a
loaf of brown bread and five currant
buns.</p>

<p>Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who
were good little bunnies, went down the
lane to gather blackberries; but Peter,
who was very naughty, ran straight to
Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed
under the gate.</p>

<p>First he ate some lettuces and some
French beans; and then he ate some
radishes; and then, feeling rather sick,
he went to look for some parsley.</p>

<p>But round the end of a cucumber
frame, whom should he meet but Mr.
McGregor!</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor was on his hands and
knees planting out young cabbages, but
he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving
a rake and calling out, "Stop thief!"</p>

<p>Peter was most dreadfully frightened;
he rushed all over the garden, for he
had forgotten the way back to the gate.</p>

<p>He lost one of his shoes amongst the
cabbages, and the other shoe amongst
the potatoes.</p>

<p>After losing them, he ran on four legs
and went faster, so that I think he might
have got away altogether if he had not
unfortunately run into a gooseberry net,
and got caught by the large buttons on
his jacket. It was a blue jacket with
brass buttons, quite new.</p>

<p>Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed
big tears; but his sobs were overheard
by some friendly sparrows, who flew to
him in great excitement, and implored
him to exert himself.</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve,
which he intended to pop upon the top
of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just
in time, leaving his jacket behind him,
and rushed into the tool-shed, and
jumped into a can. It would have been
a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had
not had so much water in it.</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor was quite sure that
Peter was somewhere in the tool-shed,
perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot.
He began to turn them over carefully,
looking under each.</p>

<p>Presently Peter sneezed&mdash;"Kerty-schoo!"
Mr. McGregor was after him
in no time, and tried to put his foot
upon Peter, who jumped out of a window,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
upsetting three plants. The window was
too small for Mr. McGregor, and he
was tired of running after Peter. He
went back to his work.</p>

<p>Peter sat down to rest; he was out
of breath and trembling with fright,
and he had not the least idea which way
to go. Also he was very damp with
sitting in that can.</p>

<p>After a time he began to wander about,
going lippity&mdash;lippity&mdash;not very fast,
and looking all around.</p>

<p>He found a door in a wall; but it was
locked, and there was no room for a
fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.</p>

<p>An old mouse was running in and out
over the stone doorstep, carrying peas
and beans to her family in the wood.
Peter asked her the way to the gate,
but she had such a large pea in her
mouth that she could not answer. She
only shook her head at him. Peter
began to cry.</p>

<p>Then he tried to find his way straight
across the garden, but he became more
and more puzzled. Presently, he came
to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled
his water-cans. A white cat was staring
at some goldfish; she sat very, very
still, but now and then the tip of her
tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter
thought it best to go away without
speaking to her; he had heard about
cats from his cousin, little Benjamin
Bunny.</p>

<p>He went back towards the tool-shed,
but suddenly, quite close to him, he
heard the noise of a hoe,&mdash;scr-r-ritch
scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter scuttered
underneath the bushes. But presently,
as nothing happened, he came
out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow
and peeped over. The first thing he
saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions.
His back was turned towards Peter, and
beyond him was the gate!</p>

<p>Peter got down very quietly off the
wheelbarrow, and started running as
fast as he could go, along a straight walk
behind some black currant-bushes.</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor caught sight of him
at the corner, but Peter did not care.
He slipped underneath the gate, and
was safe at last in the wood outside the
garden.</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket
and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten
the blackbirds.</p>

<p>Peter never stopped running or looked
behind him till he got home to the big
fir-tree.</p>

<p>He was so tired that he flopped down
upon the nice soft sand on the floor of
the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes. His
mother was busy cooking; she wondered
what he had done with his clothes. It
was the second little jacket and a pair
of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that Peter was not
very well during the evening.</p>

<p>His mother put him to bed, and made
some camomile tea; and she gave a doze
of it to Peter!</p>

<p>"One table-spoonful to be taken at
bed-time."</p>

<p>But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail
had bread and milk and blackberries
for supper.</p>

<h4><br />JOHNNY CHUCK FINDS THE
BEST THING IN THE WORLD</h4>

<div class='center'>THORNTON W. BURGESS</div>

<p>Old Mother West Wind had stopped
to talk with the Slender Fir Tree.</p>

<p>"I've just come across the Green
Meadows," said Old Mother West Wind,
"and there I saw the Best Thing in the
World."</p>

<p>Striped Chipmunk was sitting under
the Slender Fir Tree and he couldn't
help hearing what Old Mother West
Wind said. "The Best Thing in the
World&mdash;now what can that be?" thought
Striped Chipmunk. "Why, it must be
heaps and heaps of nuts and acorns!
I'll go and find it."</p>

<p>So Striped Chipmunk started down the
Lone Little Path through the wood as
fast as he could run. Pretty soon he
met Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>"Where are you going in such a hurry,
Striped Chipmunk?" asked Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>"Down in the Green Meadows to
find the Best Thing in the World,"
replied Striped Chipmunk, and ran
faster.</p>

<p>"The Best Thing in the World," said
Peter Rabbit, "why, that must be a
great pile of carrots and cabbage! I
think I'll go and find it."</p>

<p>So Peter Rabbit started down the
Lone Little Path through the wood as
fast as he could go after Striped Chipmunk.</p>

<p>As they passed the great hollow tree
Bobby Coon put his head out. "Where
are you going in such a hurry?" asked
Bobby Coon.</p>

<p>"Down in the Green Meadows to
find the Best Thing in the World!"
shouted Striped Chipmunk and Peter
Rabbit, and both began to run faster.</p>

<p>"The Best Thing in the World," said
Bobby Coon to himself, "why, that must
be a whole field of sweet milky corn! I
think I'll go and find it."</p>

<p>So Bobby Coon climbed down out of
the great hollow tree and started down
the Lone Little Path through the wood
as fast as he could go after Striped
Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit, for there
is nothing that Bobby Coon likes to
eat so well as sweet milky corn.</p>

<p>At the edge of the wood they met
Jimmy Skunk.</p>

<p>"Where are you going in such a
hurry?" asked Jimmy Skunk.</p>

<p>"Down in the Green Meadows to find
the Best Thing in the World!" shouted
Striped Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit and
Bobby Coon. Then they all tried to
run faster.</p>

<p>"The Best Thing in the World," said
Jimmy Skunk. "Why, that must be
packs and packs of beetles!" And for
once in his life Jimmy Skunk began to
hurry down the Lone Little Path after
Striped Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit
and Bobby Coon.</p>

<p>They were all running so fast that
they didn't see Reddy Fox until he
jumped out of the long grass and asked:</p>

<p>"Where are you going in such a hurry?"</p>

<p>"To find the Best Thing in the World!"
shouted Striped Chipmunk and Peter
Rabbit and Bobby Coon and Jimmy
Skunk, and each did his best to run
faster.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Best Thing in the World," said
Reddy Fox to himself. "Why, that must
be a whole pen full of tender young
chickens, and I must have them."</p>

<p>So away went Reddy Fox as fast as
he could run down the Lone Little Path
after Striped Chipmunk, Peter Rabbit,
Bobby Coon and Jimmy Skunk.</p>

<p>By and by they all came to the house
of Johnny Chuck.</p>

<p>"Where are you going in such a
hurry?" asked Johnny Chuck.</p>

<p>"To find the Best Thing in the
World," shouted Striped Chipmunk and
Peter Rabbit and Bobby Coon and
Jimmy Skunk and Reddy Fox.</p>

<p>"The Best Thing in the World," said
Johnny Chuck. "Why I don't know
of anything better than my own little
home and the warm sunshine and the
beautiful blue sky."</p>

<p>So Johnny Chuck stayed at home
and played all day among the flowers
with the Merry Little Breezes of Old
Mother West Wind and was as happy as
could be.</p>

<p>But all day long Striped Chipmunk
and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Coon and
Jimmy Skunk and Reddy Fox ran this
way and ran that way over the Green
Meadows trying to find the Best Thing
in the World. The sun was very, very
warm and they ran so far and they ran
so fast that they were very, very hot
and tired, and still they hadn't found
the Best Thing in the World.</p>

<p>When the long day was over they
started up the Lone Little Path past
Johnny Chuck's house to their own
homes. They didn't hurry now for
they were so very, very tired! And
they were cross&mdash;oh so cross! Striped
Chipmunk hadn't found a single nut.
Peter Rabbit hadn't found so much as
the leaf of a cabbage. Bobby Coon
hadn't found the tiniest bit of sweet
milky corn. Jimmy Skunk hadn't seen
a single beetle. Reddy Fox hadn't
heard so much as the peep of a chicken.
And all were as hungry as hungry
could be.</p>

<p>Half way up the Lone Little Path
they met Old Mother West Wind going
to her home behind the hill. "Did you
find the Best Thing in the World?"
asked Old Mother West Wind.</p>

<p>"No!" shouted Striped Chipmunk
and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Coon and
Jimmy Skunk and Reddy Fox all
together.</p>

<p>"Johnny Chuck has it," said Old
Mother West Wind. "It is being happy
with the things you have and not wanting
things which some one else has. And it
is called Con-tent-ment."</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_388" id="Note_388">388</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Albert Bigelow Paine (1861&mdash;), an American
author at one time connected with
the editorial department of <i>St. Nicholas
Magazine</i>, has for more than twenty years
been known as the biographer of Mark
Twain. He is a popular writer of stories for
children. Pupils in the fifth grade like
his story <i>The Arkansaw Bear</i>. Some of
his books suitable for the third and fourth
grades are <i>Hollow-Tree Nights and Days</i>,
<i>The Hollow Tree</i>, and <i>The Deep Woods</i>.
("Mr. 'Possum's Sick Spell" is from <i>Hollow-Tree
Nights and Days</i>, and is used by

Brothers, New York.)</div>


<h4><br />MR. 'POSSUM'S SICK SPELL</h4>

<div class='center'>ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE</div>

<p>Once upon a time, said the Story Teller,
something very sad nearly happened in
the Hollow Tree. It was Mr. 'Possum's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
turn, one night, to go out and borrow a
chicken from Mr. Man's roost, and coming
home he fell into an old well and lost
his chicken. He nearly lost himself, too,
for the water was icy cold and Mr.
'Possum thought he would freeze to
death before he could climb out, because
the rocks were slippery and he fell back
several times.</p>

<p>As it was, he got home almost dead,
and next morning was sicker than he
had ever been before in his life. He had
pains in his chest and other places, and
was all stuffed up in his throat and very
scared. The 'Coon and the Crow who
lived in the Hollow Tree with him were
scared, too. They put him to bed in
the big room down-stairs, and said they
thought they ought to send for somebody,
and Mr. Crow said that Mr. Owl
was a good hand with sick folks, because
he looked so wise and didn't say much,
which always made the patient think
he knew something.</p>

<p>So Mr. Crow hurried over and brought
Mr. Owl, who put on his glasses and
looked at Mr. 'Possum's tongue, and
felt of his pulse, and listened to his
breathing, and said that the cold water
seemed to have struck in and that the
only thing to do was for Mr. 'Possum
to stay in bed and drink hot herb tea
and not eat anything, which was a very
bad prescription for Mr. 'Possum, because
he hated herb tea and was very partial
to eating. He groaned when he heard
it and said he didn't suppose he'd ever
live to enjoy himself again, and that he
might just as well have stayed in the
well with the chicken, which was a great
loss and doing no good to anybody.
Then Mr. Owl went away, and told the
Crow outside that Mr. 'Possum was a
very sick man, and that at his time of
life and in his state of flesh his trouble
might go hard with him.</p>

<p>So Mr. Crow went back into the
kitchen and made up a lot of herb tea
and kept it hot on the stove, and Mr.
'Coon sat by Mr. 'Possum's bed and
made him drink it almost constantly,
which Mr. 'Possum said might cure him
if he didn't die of it before the curing
commenced.</p>

<p>He said if he just had that chicken,
made up with a good platter of dumplings,
he believed it would do him more good
than anything, and he begged the 'Coon
to go and fish it out, or to catch another
one, and try it on him, and then if he did
die he would at least have fewer regrets.</p>

<p>But the Crow and the 'Coon said they
must do as Mr. Owl ordered, unless
Mr. 'Possum wanted to change doctors,
which was not a good plan until the
case became hopeless, and that would
probably not be before some time in the
night. Mr. 'Coon said, though, there
was no reason why that nice chicken
should be wasted, and as it would still
be fresh, he would rig up a hook and
line and see if he couldn't save it. So
he got out his fishing things and made
a grab hook and left Mr. Crow to sit by
Mr. 'Possum until he came back. He
could follow Mr. 'Possum's track to the
place, and in a little while he had the
fine, fat chicken, and came home with it
and showed it to the patient, who had
a sinking spell when he looked at it,
and turned his face to the wall and said
he seemed to have lived in vain.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow, who always did the cooking,
said he'd better put the chicken on right
away, under the circumstances, and then
he remembered a bottle of medicine he
had once seen sitting on Mr. Man's
window-sill outside, and he said while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
the chicken was cooking he'd just step
over and get it, as it might do the patient
good, and it didn't seem as if anything
now could do him any harm.</p>

<p>So the Crow dressed the nice chicken
and put it in the pot with the dumplings,
and while Mr. 'Coon dosed Mr. 'Possum
with the hot herb tea Mr. Crow slipped
over to Mr. Man's house and watched a
good chance when the folks were at
dinner, and got the bottle and came back
with it and found Mr. 'Possum taking a
nap and the 'Coon setting the table; for
the dinner was about done and there
was a delicious smell of dumplings and
chicken, which made Mr. 'Possum begin
talking in his sleep about starving to
death in the midst of plenty. Then he
woke up and seemed to suffer a good deal,
and the Crow gave him a dose of Mr.
Man's medicine, and said that if Mr.
'Possum was still with them next morning
they'd send for another doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Possum took the medicine and
choked on it, and when he could speak
said he wouldn't be with them. He
could tell by his feelings, he said, that
he would never get through this day
of torture, and he wanted to say some
last words. Then he said that he wanted
the 'Coon to have his Sunday suit, which
was getting a little tight for him and
would just about fit Mr. 'Coon, and that
he wanted the Crow to have his pipe
and toilet articles, to remember him by.
He said he had tried to do well by them
since they had all lived together in the
Hollow Tree, and he supposed it would
be hard for them to get along without
him, but that they would have to do
the best they could. Then he guessed
he'd try to sleep a little, and closed his
eyes. Mr. 'Coon looked at Mr. Crow
and shook his head, and they didn't
feel like sitting down to dinner right
away, and pretty soon when they thought
Mr. 'Possum was asleep they slipped
softly up to his room to see how sad
it would seem without him.</p>

<p>Well, they had only been gone a
minute when Mr. 'Possum woke up, for
the smell of that chicken and dumpling
coming in from Mr. Crow's kitchen was
too much for him. When he opened
his eyes and found that Mr. 'Coon and
Mr. Crow were not there, and that he
felt a little better&mdash;perhaps because of
Mr. Man's medicine&mdash;he thought he
might as well step out and take one last
look at chicken and dumpling, anyway.</p>

<p>It was quite warm, but, being all in a
sweat, he put the bed-sheet around him
to protect him from the draughts and
went out to the stove and looked into
the pot, and when he saw how good it
looked he thought he might as well
taste of it to see if it was done. So he
did, and it tasted so good and seemed so
done that he got out a little piece of
dumpling on a fork, and blew on it to
cool it, and ate it, and then another piece
and then the whole dumpling, which he
sopped around in the gravy after each
bite. Then when the dumpling was gone
he fished up a chicken leg and ate that
and then a wing, and then the gizzard
and felt better all the time, and pretty
soon poured out a cup of coffee and drank
that, all before he remembered that he
was sick abed and not expected to
recover. Then he happened to think
and started back to bed, but on the way
there he heard Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow
talking softly in his room and he forgot
again that he was so sick and went up
to see about it.</p>

<p>Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow had been
quite busy up in Mr. 'Possum's room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
They had looked at all the things, and
Mr. Crow remarked that there seemed
to be a good many which Mr. 'Possum
had not mentioned, and which they could
divide afterward. Then he picked up
Mr. 'Possum's pipe and tried it to see
if it would draw well, as he had noticed,
he said, that Mr. 'Possum sometimes had
trouble with it, and the 'Coon went over
to the closet and looked at Mr. 'Possum's
Sunday suit, and pretty soon got it out
and tried on the coat, which wouldn't
need a thing done to it to make it fit
exactly. He said he hoped Mr. 'Possum
was resting well, after the medicine,
which he supposed was something to
make him sleep, as he had seemed drowsy
so soon after taking it. He said it would
be sad, of course, though it might seem
almost a blessing, if Mr. 'Possum should
pass away in his sleep, without knowing
it, and he hoped Mr. 'Possum would
rest in peace and not come back to distress
people, as one of Mr. 'Coon's own
ancestors had done, a good while ago.
Mr. 'Coon said his mother used to tell
them about it when she wanted to keep
them at home nights, though he didn't
really believe in such things much, any
more, and he didn't think Mr. 'Possum
would be apt to do it, anyway, because
he was always quite a hand to rest well.
Of course, <i>any one</i> was likely to <i>think</i> of
such things, he said, and get a little
nervous, especially at a time like this&mdash;and
just then Mr. 'Coon looked toward
the door that led down to the big room,
and Mr. Crow he looked toward that
door, too, and Mr. 'Coon gave a great
jump, and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness!" and fell back
over Mr. 'Possum's trunk.</p>

<p>And Mr. Crow he gave a great jump,
too, and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, my gracious!" and fell back over
Mr. 'Possum's chair.</p>

<p>For there in the door stood a figure
shrouded all in white, all except the
head, which was Mr. 'Possum's, though
very solemn, its eyes looking straight at
Mr. 'Coon, who still had on Mr. 'Possum's
coat, though he was doing his best
to get it off, and at Mr. Crow, who still
had Mr. 'Possum's pipe, though he was
trying every way to hide it, and both of
them were scrabbling around on the floor
and saying, "Oh, Mr. 'Possum, go away&mdash;please
go away, Mr. 'Possum&mdash;we
always loved you, Mr. 'Possum&mdash;we can
prove it."</p>

<p>But Mr. 'Possum looked straight at
Mr. 'Coon, and said in a deep voice:</p>

<p>"What were you doing with my Sunday
coat on?"</p>

<p>And Mr. 'Coon tried to say something,
but only made a few weak noises.</p>

<p>And Mr. 'Possum looked at Mr. Crow
and said:</p>

<p>"What were you doing with my pipe?"</p>

<p>And a little sweat broke out on Mr.
Crow's bill, and he opened his mouth
as if he were going to say something,
but couldn't make a sound.</p>

<p>Then Mr. 'Possum said, in a slow voice,
so deep that it seemed to come from
down in the ground:</p>

<p>"<i>Give me my things!</i>"</p>

<p>And Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow said,
very shaky:</p>

<p>"Oh y-yes, Mr. 'Possum, w-we meant
to, a-all the t-time."</p>

<p>And they tried to get up, but were
so scared and weak they couldn't, and
all at once Mr. 'Possum gave a great
big laugh and threw off his sheet and
sat down on a stool, and rocked and
laughed, and Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow
realized then that it was Mr. 'Possum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
himself, and not just his appearance, as
they had thought. Then they sat up,
and pretty soon began to laugh, too,
though not very gaily at first, but feeling
more cheerful every minute, because
Mr. 'Possum himself seemed to enjoy
it so much.</p>

<p>Then Mr. 'Possum told them about
everything, and how Mr. Man's medicine
must have made him well, for all his
pains and sorrows had left him, and he
invited them down to help finish up the
chicken which had cost him so much
suffering.</p>

<p>So then they all went down to the big
room and the Crow brought in the big
platter of dumplings, and a pan of
biscuits and some molasses, and a pot
of coffee, and they all sat down and
celebrated Mr. 'Possum's recovery. And
when they were through, and everything
was put away, they smoked, and Mr.
'Possum said he was glad he was there
to use his property a little more, and
that probably his coat would fit him
again now, as his sickness had caused him
to lose flesh. He said that Mr. Man's
medicine was certainly wonderful, but
just then Mr. Rabbit dropped in, and
when they told him about it, he said
of course the medicine might have had
some effect, but that the dumplings and
chicken caused the real cure. He said
there was an old adage to prove that&mdash;one
that his thirty-fifth great-grandfather
had made for just such a case of
this kind. This, Mr. Rabbit said, was
the adage:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If you want to live forever<br />
Stuff a cold and starve a fever."<br />
</div>

<p>Mr. 'Possum's trouble had come from
catching cold, he said, so the dumplings
were probably just what he needed.
Then Mr. Owl dropped in to see how his
patient was, and when he saw him
sitting up, and smoking, and well, he
said it was wonderful how his treatment
had worked, and the Hollow Tree people
didn't tell him any different, for they
didn't like to hurt Mr. Owl's feelings.</p>

<h4><br />WILD LIFE IN THE FARM-YARD</h4>

<div class='center'>DALLAS LORE SHARP</div>

<p>I want you to visit a farm where there
are turkeys and geese and guineas. If
you live in New York City or in Chicago
you may not be able to do so for some
time. Then take a trip to the market
or to the zo&ouml;logical gardens. But most
of you live close enough to the country,
so that you could easily find a farmer
who would invite you out to see his
prize gobbler and his great hissing
gander.</p>

<p>However, I shall not wait to <i>send</i> you
for I am going to <i>take</i> you&mdash;now&mdash;out
to an old farm that I loved as a boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
where there are turkeys and geese and
guineas and pigs and pigeons, cows and
horses and mules, cats and dogs, chickens
and bees and sheep, and a hornets' nest
and a nest of flying squirrels in the same
old grindstone apple-tree, and a pair of
barn owls in the old wagon house, and&mdash;I
don't know what else; for there was
everything on the old farm when I was
a boy, and I suppose we shall find everything
there yet.</p>

<p>I want you to see the turkeys. I want
you to follow an old hen turkey to her
stolen nest. I want you to watch the
old gobbler turkey take his family to
bed&mdash;to roost, I mean. For unless you
are a boy, and are living in the wild
portions of Georgia and the southeastern
states, you may never see a wild turkey.
For that reason I want you to watch
this tame turkey, because he is almost
as wild as a wild turkey in everything
except his fear of you. He has been
tamed, we know, since the year 1526,
yet not one of his wild habits has been
changed.</p>

<p>So it is with the house cat. We have
tamed the house cat, but we have not
changed the wild, night-prowling hunter
in him. You have to smooth a cat the
right way, or the <i>wild</i> cat in him will
scratch and bite you. Have you never
seen his tail twitch, his eyes blaze, his
claws work as he has crouched watching
at a rat's hole, or crawled stealthily upon
a bird in the meadow grass?</p>

<p>So, if you will watch, you shall see <ins title="Transcriber's Note: This word was originally between 'old' and 'gobbler'">a</ins>
real wild turkey in the tamest old
gobbler on the farm.</p>

<p>Watch him go to roost. Watch him
get <i>ready</i> to go to roost, I should say,
for a turkey seems to begin to think of
roosting about noon-time, especially in
the winter; and it takes him from about
noon till night to make up his mind that
he really must go to roost.</p>

<p>He comes along under the apple-tree
of a December afternoon and looks up
at the leafless limbs where he has been
roosting since summer. He stretches
his long neck, lays his little brainless
head over on one side, then over on the
other. He takes a good <i>long</i> look at
the limb. Then bobs his head&mdash;one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-<i>ten</i>
times, or perhaps twenty-two or -three
times, and takes a still <i>longer</i> look at
the limb, saying to himself&mdash;<i>quint, quint,
quint, quint!</i> which means: "I think
I'll go to roost! I think <i>I'll</i> go to roost!
I think I'll go to <i>roost!</i> I think I'll <i>go</i>
to roost! I think I'll go <i>to</i> roost! I
<i>think</i> I'll go to roost!" He <i>thinks</i> he
will, but he hasn't made up his mind
quite.</p>

<p>Then he stretches his long neck again,
lays his little witless head on the side
again, bobs and bobs, looks and looks
and looks, says <i>quint, quint, quint, quint</i>&mdash;"I
<i>think</i> I'll go to roost," but is just as
undecided as ever.</p>

<p>He does the performance over and
over again and would never go to roost
if the darkness did not come and compel
him. He would stand under that tree
stretching, turning, looking, bobbing,
"squinting," <i>thinking</i>, until he thought
his head off, saying all the while&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
One for the money; two for the show;<br />
Three to get ready; and four to&mdash;<i>get ready to go!</i><br />
</div>

<p>But after a while, along toward dusk
(and awfully suddenly!)&mdash;<i>flop! gobble!
splutter! whoop!</i>&mdash;and there he is, up on
the limb, safe! Really safe! But it was
an exceedingly close call.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span></p>

<p>And this is the very way the wild
turkey acts. The naturalists who had
a chance to study the great flocks of
wild turkeys years ago describe these
same absurd actions. This lack of snap
and decision is not something the tame
turkey has learned in the farm-yard.
The fact is he does not seem to have
learned anything during his 350 years
in the barn-yard, nor does he seem to
have forgotten anything that he knew
as a wild turkey in the woods, except
his fear of man.</p>

<p>Late in October the wild turkeys of
a given neighborhood would get together
in flocks of from ten to a hundred and
travel on foot through the rich bottom
lands in search of food. In these
journeys the males would go ahead,
apart from the females, and lead the
way. The hens, each conducting her
family in a more or less separate group,
came straggling leisurely along in the rear.
As they advanced, they would meet other
flocks, thus swelling their numbers.</p>

<p>After a time they were sure to come
to a river&mdash;a dreadful thing, for, like
the river of the old song, it was a river
<i>to cross</i>. Up and down the banks would
stalk the gobblers, stretching their necks
out over the water and making believe
to start, as they do when going to roost
in the apple-trees.</p>

<p>All day long, all the next day, all the
third day, if the river was wide, they
would strut and cluck along the shore,
making up their minds.</p>

<p>The ridiculous creatures have wings;
they can fly; but they are afraid! After
all these days, however, the whole flock
has mounted the tallest trees along the
bank. One of the gobblers has come
forward as leader in the emergency.
Suddenly, from his perch, he utters a
single cluck&mdash;the signal for the start,&mdash;and
every turkey sails into the air.
There is a great flapping&mdash;and the
terrible river is crossed.</p>

<p>A few weak members fall on the way
over, but not to drown. Drawing their
wings close in against their sides, and
spreading their round fan-like tails to
the breeze, they strike out as if born to
swim, and come quickly to land.</p>

<p>The tame turkey-hen is notorious for
stealing her nest. The wild hen steals
hers&mdash;not to plague her owner, of course,
as is the common belief about the
domestic turkey, but to get away from
the gobbler, who, in order to prolong
the honeymoon, will break the eggs as
fast as they are laid. He has just
enough brains to be sentimental, jealous,
and boundlessly fond of himself. His
wives, too, are foolish enough to worship
him, until&mdash;there is an egg in the nest.
That event makes them wise. They
understand this strutting coxcomb, and
quietly turning their backs on him, leave
him to parade alone.</p>

<p>There are crows, also, and buzzards
from whom the wild turkey hen must
hide the eggs. Nor dare she forget her
own danger while sitting, for there are
foxes, owls, and prowling lynxes ready
enough to pounce upon her. On the
farm there are still many of these enemies
besides the worst of them all, the farmer
himself.</p>

<p>For a nest the wild hen, like the tame
turkey of the pasture, scratches a slight
depression in the ground, usually under
a thick bush, sometimes in a hollow
log, and there lays from twelve to twenty
eggs, which are somewhat smaller and
more elongated than the tame turkey's,
but of the same color: dull cream,
sprinkled with reddish dots.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span></p>

<p>I have often hunted for stolen turkey
nests, and hunted in vain, because the
cautious mother had covered her eggs
when leaving them. This is one of the
wild habits that has persisted. The wild
hen, as the hatching approaches, will
not trust even this precaution, however,
but remains without food and drink
upon the nest until the chicks can be
led off. She can scarcely be driven
from the nest, often allowing herself
to be captured first.</p>

<p>Mother-love burns fierce in her. Such
helpless things are her chicks! She
hears them peeping in the shell and
breaks it to help them out. She preens
and dries them and keeps them close
under her for days.</p>

<p>Not for a week after they are hatched
does she allow them out in a rain. If,
after that, they get a cold wetting, the
wild mother, it is said, will feed the buds
of the spice-bush to her brood, as our
grandmothers used to administer mint
tea to us.</p>

<p>The tame hen does seem to have lost
something of this wild-mother skill,
doubtless because for many generations
she has been entirely freed of the larger
part of the responsibility.</p>

<p>I never knew a tame mother turkey
to doctor her infants for vermin. But
the wild hen will. The woods are full
of ticks and detestable vermin as deadly
as cold rains. When her brood begins
to lag and pine, the wild mother knows,
and leading them to some old ant-hill,
she gives them a sousing dust-bath.
The vermin hate the odor of the ant-scented
dust, and after a series of these
baths disappear.</p>

<p>This is wise; and if this report be
true, then the wild turkey is as wise
and far-seeing a mother as the woods
contain. One observer even tells of
three hens that stole off together and
fixed up a nest between themselves.
Each put in her eggs&mdash;forty-two in all&mdash;
and each took turns guarding, so that
the nest was never left alone.</p>

<p>What special enemy caused this unique
partnership the naturalist does not say.
The three mothers built together, brooded
together, and together guarded the nest.
But how did those three mothers divide
the babies?</p>

<p>I said I wanted you to visit a farm
where there are turkeys. And you will
have to if you would see the turkey at
home. For, though I have traveled
through the South, and been in the
swamps and river "bottoms" there all
along the Savannah, with wild turkeys
around me, I have never seen a live
one.</p>

<p>I was in a small steamboat on the
Savannah River one night. We were
tied up till morning along the river bank
under the trees of the deep swamp.
Twilight and the swamp silence had
settled about us. The moon came up.
A banjo had been twanging, but the
breakdown was done, the shuffling feet
quiet. The little cottonboat had become
a part of the moonlit silence and the
river swamp.</p>

<p>Two or three roustabouts were lounging
upon some rosin-barrels near by,
under the spell of the round autumnal
moon. There was frost in the air, and
fragrant odors, but not a sound, not a
cry or call of beast or bird, until, suddenly,
breaking through the silence with
a jarring eery echo, was heard the hoot
of the great horned owl.</p>

<p>One of the roustabouts dropped quickly
to the deck and held up his hand for
silence. We all listened. And again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
came the uncanny <i>Whoo-hoo-hoo-whoo-you-oh-oh!</i></p>

<p>"Dat ol' King Owl," whispered the
darky. "Him's lookin' fer turkey. Ol'
gobbler done gone hid, I reckon. Listen!
Ol' King Owl gwine make ol' gobbler
talk back."</p>

<p>We listened, but there was no frightened
"gobble" from the tree-tops. There
were wild turkeys all around me in the
swamp; but, though I sat up until the
big southern moon rode high overhead,
I heard no answer, no challenge to the
echoing hoot of the great owl. The
next day a colored boy brought aboard
the boat a wild turkey which he had
shot in the swamp; but I am still waiting
to see and hear the great bronze
bird alive in its native haunts.</p>

<h4><br />THE VENDETTA</h4>

<div class='center'>VERNON L. KELLOGG</div>

<p>This is the story of a fight. In the
first story of this book, I said that Mary
and I had seen a remarkable fight one
evening at sundown on the slopes of
the bare brown foothills west of the
campus. It was not a battle of armies&mdash;
we have seen that, too, in the little world
we watch,&mdash;but a combat of gladiators,
a struggle between two champions born
and bred for fighting, and particularly
for fighting each other. One champion
was Eurypelma, the great, black, hairy,
eight-legged, strong-fanged tarantula of
California, and the other was Pepsis, a
mighty wasp in dull-blue mail, with
rusty-red wings and a poisonous javelin
of a sting that might well frighten either
you or me. Do you have any wasp in
your neighborhood of the ferocity and
strength and size of Pepsis? If not,
you can hardly realize what a terrible
creature she is. With her strong hard-cased
body an inch and a half long,
borne on powerful wings that expand
fully three inches, and her long and
strong needle-pointed sting that darts
in and out like a flash and is always full
of virulent poison, Pepsis is certainly
queen of all the wasp amazons. But if
that is so, no less is Eurypelma greatest,
most dreadful, and fiercest, and hence
king, of all the spiders in this country.
In South America and perhaps elsewhere
in the tropics, live the fierce bird-spiders
with thick legs extending three
inches or more on each side of their ugly
hairy bodies. Eurypelma, the California
tarantula, is not quite so large as that,
nor does he stalk, pounce on and kill
little birds as his South American cousin
is said to do, but he is nevertheless a
tremendous and fear-inspiring creature
among the small beasties of field and
meadow.</p>

<p>But not all Eurypelmas are so ferocious;
or at least are not ferocious all
the time. There are individual differences
among them. Perhaps it is a
matter of age or health. Anyway, I
had a pet tarantula which I kept in an
open jar in my room for several weeks,
and I could handle him with impunity.
He would sit gently on my hand, or walk
deliberately up my arm, with his eight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
fixed, shining, little reddish eyes staring
hard at me, and his long seven-jointed
hairy legs swinging gently and rhythmically
along, without a sign of hesitation
or excitement. His hair was almost
gray and perhaps this hoariness and
general sedateness betokened a ripe old
age. But his great fangs were unblunted,
his supply of poison undiminished, and
his skill in striking and killing his prey
still perfect, as often proved at his feeding
times. He is quite the largest
Eurypelma I have ever seen. He measures&mdash;for
I still have his body, carefully
stuffed, and fastened on a block with
legs all spread out&mdash;five inches from
tip to tip of opposite legs.</p>

<p>At the same time that I had this
hoary old tarantula, I had another
smaller, coal-black fellow who went into
a perfect ecstasy of anger and ferocity
every time any one came near him. He
would stand on his hind legs and paw
wildly with fore legs and palpi, and lunge
forward fiercely at my inquisitive pencil.
I found him originally in the middle
of an entry into a classroom, holding at
bay an entire excited class of art students
armed with mahl-sticks and paint-brushes.
The students were mostly women, and
I was hailed as deliverer and greatest
<i>dompteur</i> of beasts when I scooped
Eurypelma up in a bottle and walked
off with him.</p>

<p>But this is not telling of the sundown
fight that Mary and I saw together.
We had been over to the sand-cut by
the golf links, after mining-bees, and
were coming home with a fine lot of
their holes and some of the bees themselves,
when Mary suddenly called to
me to "see the nice tarantula."</p>

<p>Perhaps nice isn't the best word for
him, but he certainly was an unusually
imposing and fluffy-haired and fierce-looking
brute of a tarantula. He had
rather an owly way about him, as if
he had come out from his hole too
early and was dazed and half-blinded
by the light. Tarantulas are night
prowlers; they do all their hunting after
dark, dig their holes and, indeed, carry
on all the various businesses of their
life in the night-time. The occasional
one found walking about in daytime
has made a mistake, someway, and he
blunders around quite like an owl in
the sunshine.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, while Mary and I
were smiling at this too early bird of a
tarantula, he went up on his hind legs in
fighting attitude, and at the same instant
down darted a great tarantula hawk,
that is, a Pepsis wasp. Her armored
body glinted cool and metallic in the
red sunset light, and her great wings had
a suggestive shining of dull fire about
them. She checked her swoop just
before reaching Eurypelma, and made a
quick dart over him, and then a quick
turn back, intending to catch the tarantula
in the rear. But lethargic and
owly as Eurypelma had been a moment
before, he was now all alertness
and agility. He had to be. He was
defending his life. One full fair stab
of the poisoned javelin, sheathed but
ready at the tip of the flexible, blue-black
body hovering over him, and it
would be over with Eurypelma. And he
knew it. Or perhaps he didn't. But
he acted as if he did. He was going
to do his best not to be stabbed; that
was sure. And Pepsis was going to do
her best to stab; that also was quickly
certain.</p>

<p>At the same time Pepsis knew&mdash;or
anyway acted as if she did&mdash;that to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
struck by one or both of those terrible
vertical, poison-filled fangs was sure
death. It would be like a blow from a
battle-axe, with the added horror of
mortal poison poured into the wound.</p>

<p>So Eurypelma about-faced like a
flash, and Pepsis was foiled in her
strategy. She flew up and a yard away,
then returned to the attack. She flew
about in swift circles over his head,
preparatory to darting in again. But
Eurypelma was ready. As she swooped
viciously down, he lunged up and forward
with a half-leap, half-forward fall,
and came within an ace of striking the
trailing blue-black abdomen with his
reaching fangs. Indeed it seemed to
Mary and me as if they really grazed
the metallic body. But evidently they
had not pierced the smooth armor. Nor
had Pepsis in that breathless moment of
close quarters been able to plant her
lance. She whirled, up high this time
but immediately back, although a little
more wary evidently, for she checked
her downward plunge three or four
inches from the dancing champion on
the ground. And so for wild minute
after minute it went on; Eurypelma
always up and tip-toeing on those strong
hind legs, with open, armed mouth
always toward the point of attack, and
Pepsis ever darting down, up, over,
across, and in and out in dizzy dashes,
but never quite closing.</p>

<p>Were Mary and I excited? Not a
word could we utter; only now and
then a swift intake of breath; a stifled
"O" or "Ah" or "See." And then of
a sudden came the end. Pepsis saw
her chance. A lightning swoop carried
her right on to the hairy champion.
The quivering lance shot home. The
poison coursed into the great soft body.
But at the same moment the terrible
fangs struck fair on the blue armor and
crashed through it. Two awful wounds,
and the wings of dull fire beat violently
only to strike up a little cloud of dust
and whirl the mangled body around
and around. Fortunately Death was
merciful, and the brave amazon made
a quick end.</p>

<p>But what of Eurypelma, the killer?
Was it well with him? The sting-made
wound itself was of little moment; it
closed as soon as the lancet withdrew.
But not before the delicate poison sac
at its base inside the wasp-body had
contracted and squirted down the slender
hollow of the sting a drop of liquid
fire. And so it was not well with Eurypelma
in his insides. Victor he seemed
to be, but if he could think, he must
have had grave doubts about the joys
of victory.</p>

<p>For a curious drowsiness was coming
over him. Perhaps, disquieting thought,
it was the approaching stupor of the
poison's working. His strong long legs
became limp, they would not work
regularly, they could not hold his heavy
hairy body up from the ground. He
would get into his hole and rest. But
it was too late. And after a few uneven
steps, victor Eurypelma settled heavily
down beside his amazon victim, inert
and forevermore beyond fighting. He
was paralyzed.</p>

<p>And so Mary and I brought him home
in our collecting box, together with the
torn body of Pepsis with her wings of
slow fire dulled by the dust of her last
struggles. And though it is a whole
month now since Eurypelma received
his stab from the poisoned javelin of
Pepsis, he has not recovered; nor will
he ever. When you touch him, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
draws up slowly one leg after another,
or moves a palpus feebly. But it is
living death; a hopeless paralytic is
the king.</p>

<p>Dear reader, you are of course as
bright as Mary, and so you have noticed,
as she did right away, the close parallel
between what happened to Eurypelma
and what happened to the measuring-worms
brought by Ammophila to her
nest burrow as described in the first
story in this book. And so, like Mary,
you realize that the vendetta or life
feud between the tarantula family and
the family of Pepsis, the tarantula hawk,
is based on reasons of domestic economy
rather than on those of sentiment, which
determine vendettas in Corsica and
feuds in Kentucky.</p>

<p>To be quite plain, Pepsis fights Eurypelma
to get his huge, juicy body for
food for her young; and Eurypelma
fights Pepsis to keep from becoming
paralyzed provender. If Pepsis had
escaped unhurt in the combat at which
Mary and I "assisted," as the French
say, as enthralled spectators, we should
have seen her drag by mighty effort the
limp, paralyzed, spider giant to her
nest hole not far distant&mdash;a great hole
twelve inches deep and with a side chamber
at the bottom. There she would have
thrust him down the throat of the burrow,
and then crawled in and laid an egg on
the helpless beast, from which in time
would have hatched the carnivorous
wasp grub. Pepsis has many close
allies among the wasps, all black or
steely blue with smoky or dull-bronze
wings, and they all use spiders, stung and
paralyzed, to store their nest holes with.</p>

<p>"Do the little black and blue wasps
hunt the little spiders and the larger
ones the big spiders?" asked Mary.</p>

<p>"Exactly," I respond, "and the giant
wasp of them all, Pepsis, the queen of
the wasp amazons, hunts only the biggest
spider of them all, Eurypelma, the
tarantula king, and we have seen her
do it."</p>

<p>"Well," says Mary, "even if she wants
him for her children to eat, it's a real
vendetta, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it is," I answer, "it's more
real, and fiercer, and more relentless, and
more persistent than any human vendetta
that ever was. For every Pepsis
mother in the world is always hunting
for Eurypelmas to fight. And not <i>all</i>
Corsicans have a vendetta on hand, nor
all Kentuckians a feud."</p>

<div class="hang1">Sewell Ford (1868-) is noted for his fine
stories about horses, especially those in
<i>Horses Nine</i>, from which the following
story of "Pasha" is taken. (By permission

part in a human romance with war
as a background, and the combination is
very effective. Mr. Ford's <i>Torchy</i> stories
are also very popular with young people.</div>


<h4><br />PASHA, THE SON OF SELIM</h4>

<div class='center'>SEWELL FORD</div>

<p>Long, far too long, has the story of
Pasha, son of Selim, remained untold.</p>

<p>The great Selim, you know, was
brought from far across the seas, where
he had been sold for a heavy purse by
a venerable sheik, who tore his beard
during the bargain and swore by Allah
that without Selim there would be for
him no joy in life. Also he had wept
quite convincingly on Selim's neck&mdash;but
he finished by taking the heavy purse.
That was how Selim, the great Selim,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
came to end his days in Fayette County,
Kentucky. Of his many sons, Pasha
was one.</p>

<p>In almost idyllic manner were spent
the years of Pasha's coltdom. They
were years of pasture roaming and blue
grass cropping. When the time was
ripe, began the hunting lessons. Pasha
came to know the feel of the saddle and
the voice of the hounds. He was taught
the long, easy lope. He learned how
to gather himself for a sail through the
air over a hurdle or a water-jump. Then
when he could take five bars clean, when
he could clear an eight-foot ditch, when
his wind was so sound that he could
lead the chase from dawn until high
noon, he was sent to the stables of a
Virginia tobacco-planter who had need
of a new hunter and who could afford
Arab blood.</p>

<p>In the stalls at Gray Oaks stables
were many good hunters, but none
better than Pasha. Cream-white he
was, from the tip of his splendid, yard-long
tail to his pink-lipped muzzle. His
coat was as silk plush, his neck as supple
as a swan's, and out of his big, bright
eyes there looked such intelligence that
one half expected him to speak. His
lines were all long, graceful curves, and
when he danced daintily on his slender
legs one could see the muscles flex under
the delicate skin.</p>

<p>Miss Lou claimed Pasha for her very
own at first sight. As no one at Gray
Oaks denied Miss Lou anything at all,
to her he belonged from that instant.
Of Miss Lou, Pasha approved thoroughly.
She knew that bridle-reins were for
gentle guidance, not for sawing or jerking,
and that a riding-crop was of no
use whatever save to unlatch a gate or
to cut at an unruly hound. She knew
how to rise on the stirrup when Pasha
lifted himself in his stride, and how to
settle close to the pig-skin when his
hoofs hit the ground. In other words,
she had a good seat, which means as
much to the horse as it does to the rider.</p>

<p>Besides all this, it was Miss Lou who
insisted that Pasha should have the best
of grooming, and she never forgot to
bring the dainties which Pasha loved,
an apple or a carrot or a sugarplum.
It is something, too, to have your nose
patted by a soft gloved hand and to
have such a person as Miss Lou put her
arm around your neck and whisper in
your ear. From no other than Miss
Lou would Pasha permit such intimacy.</p>

<p>No paragon, however, was Pasha. He
had a temper, and his whims were as
many as those of a school-girl. He was
particular as to who put on his bridle.
He had notions concerning the manner
in which a currycomb should be used.
A red ribbon or a bandanna handkerchief
put him in a rage, while green, the holy
color of the Mohammedan, soothed his
nerves. A lively pair of heels he had,
and he knew how to use his teeth. The
black stable-boys found that out, and so
did the stern-faced man who was known
as "Mars" Clayton. This "Mars" Clayton
had ridden Pasha once, had ridden
him as he rode his big, ugly, hard-bitted
roan hunter, and Pasha had not enjoyed
the ride. Still, Miss Lou and Pasha
often rode out with "Mars" Clayton
and the parrot-nosed roan. That is,
they did until the coming of Mr. Dave.</p>

<p>In Mr. Dave, Pasha found a new friend.
From a far Northern State was Mr.
Dave. He had come in a ship to buy
tobacco, but after he had bought his
cargo he still stayed at Gray Oaks, "to
complete Pasha's education," so he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span></p>

<p>Many ways had Mr. Dave which
Pasha liked. He had a gentle manner
of talking to you, of smoothing your
flanks and rubbing your ears, which
gained your confidence and made you
sure that he understood. He was firm
and sure in giving command, yet so
patient in teaching one tricks, that it
was a pleasure to learn.</p>

<p>So, almost before Pasha knew it, he
could stand on his hind legs, could step
around in a circle in time to a tune
which Mr. Dave whistled, and could do
other things which few horses ever learn
to do. His chief accomplishment, however,
was to kneel on his forelegs in the
attitude of prayer. A long time it took
Pasha to learn this, but Mr. Dave told
him over and over again, by word and
sign, until at last the son of the great
Selim could strike a pose such as would
have done credit to a Mecca pilgrim.</p>

<p>"It's simply wonderful!" declared
Miss Lou.</p>

<p>But it was nothing of the sort. Mr.
Dave had been teaching tricks to horses
ever since he was a small boy, and never
had he found such an apt pupil as Pasha.</p>

<p>Many a glorious gallop did Pasha and
Miss Lou have while Mr. Dave stayed
at Gray Oaks, Dave riding the big bay
gelding that Miss Lou, with all her daring,
had never ventured to mount. It
was not all galloping though, for Pasha
and the big bay often walked for miles
through the wood lanes, side by side
and very close together, while Miss
Lou and Mr. Dave talked, talked,
talked. How they could ever find
so much to say to each other Pasha
wondered.</p>

<p>But at last Mr. Dave went away,
and with his going ended good times
for Pasha, at least for many months.
There followed strange doings. There
was much excitement among the stable-boys,
much riding about, day and night,
by the men of Gray Oaks, and no hunting
at all. One day the stables were
cleared of all horses save Pasha.</p>

<p>"Some time, if he is needed badly,
you may have Pasha, but not now."
Miss Lou had said. And then she had
hidden her face in his cream-white mane
and sobbed. Just what the trouble was
Pasha did not understand, but he was
certain "Mars" Clayton was at the
bottom of it.</p>

<p>No longer did Miss Lou ride about
the country. Occasionally she galloped
up and down the highway, to the Pointdexters
and back, just to let Pasha
stretch his legs. Queer sights Pasha
saw on these trips. Sometimes he would
pass many men on horses riding close
together in a pack, as the hounds run
when they have the scent. They wore
strange clothing, did these men, and they
carried, instead of riding-crops, big
shiny knives that swung at their sides.
The sight of them set Pasha's nerves
tingling. He would sniff curiously after
them and then prick forward his ears
and dance nervously.</p>

<p>Of course Pasha knew that something
unusual was going on, but what it was
he could not guess. There came a time,
however, when he found out all about
it. Months had passed when, late one
night, a hard-breathing, foam-splotched,
mud-covered horse was ridden into the
yard and taken into the almost deserted
stable. Pasha heard the harsh voice
of "Mars" Clayton swearing at the
stable-boy. Pasha heard his own name
spoken, and guessed that it was he who
was wanted. Next came Miss Lou to
the stable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," he heard "Mars"
Clayton say, "but I've got to get out
of this. The Yanks are not more than
five miles behind."</p>

<p>"But you'll take good care of him,
won't you?" he heard Miss Lou ask
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; of course," replied "Mars"
Clayton, carelessly.</p>

<p>A heavy saddle was thrown on Pasha's
back, the girths pulled cruelly tight, and
in a moment "Mars" Clayton was on
his back. They were barely clear of
Gray Oaks driveway before Pasha felt
something he had never known before.
It was as if someone had jabbed a lot
of little knives into his ribs. Roused
by pain and fright, Pasha reared in a
wild attempt to unseat this hateful
rider. But "Mars" Clayton's knees
seemed glued to Pasha's shoulders. Next
Pasha tried to shake him off by sudden
leaps, sidebolts, and stiff-legged jumps.
These man&#339;uvres brought vicious jerks
on the wicked chain-bit that was cutting
Pasha's tender mouth sorrily and more
jabs from the little knives. In this way
did Pasha fight until his sides ran with
blood and his breast was plastered thick
with reddened foam.</p>

<p>In the meantime he had covered miles
of road, and at last, along in the cold
gray of the morning, he was ridden into
a field where were many tents and horses.
Pasha was unsaddled and picketed to a
stake. This latter indignity he was too
much exhausted to resent. All he could
do was to stand, shivering with cold,
trembling from nervous excitement, and
wait for what was to happen next.</p>

<p>It seemed ages before anything did
happen. The beginning was a tripping
bugle-blast. This was answered by the
voice of other bugles blown here and
there about the field. In a moment
men began to tumble out of the white
tents. They came by twos and threes
and dozens, until the field was full of
them. Fires were built on the ground,
and soon Pasha could scent coffee boiling
and bacon frying. Black boys began
moving about among the horses with
hay and oats and water. One of them
rubbed Pasha hurriedly with a wisp of
straw. It was little like the currying
and rubbing with brush and comb and
flannel to which he was accustomed and
which he needed just then, oh, how
sadly. His strained muscles had stiffened
so much that every movement gave him
pain. So matted was his coat with
sweat and foam and mud that it seemed
as if half the pores of his skin were
choked.</p>

<p>He had cooled his parched throat
with a long draught of somewhat muddy
water, but he had eaten only half of
the armful of hay when again the bugles
sounded and "Mars" Clayton appeared.
Tightening the girths, until they almost
cut into Pasha's tender skin, he jumped
into the saddle and rode off to where a
lot of big black horses were being reined
into line. In front of this line Pasha
was wheeled. He heard the bugles
sound once more, heard his rider shout
something to the men behind, felt the
wicked little knives in his sides, and
then, in spite of aching legs, was forced
into a sharp gallop. Although he knew
it not, Pasha had joined the Black
Horse Cavalry.</p>

<p>The months that followed were to
Pasha one long, ugly dream. Not that
he minded the hard riding by day and
night. In time he became used to all
that. He could even endure the irregular
feeding, the sleeping in the open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
during all kinds of weather, and the
lack of proper grooming. But the vicious
jerks on the torture-provoking cavalry
bit, the flat sabre blows on the flank
which he not infrequently got from his
ill-tempered master, and, above all, the
cruel digs of the spur-wheels&mdash;these
things he could not understand. Such
treatment he was sure he did not merit.
"Mars" Clayton he came to hate more
and more. Some day, Pasha told himself,
he would take vengeance with
teeth and heels, even if he died for it.</p>

<p>In the meantime he had learned the
cavalry drill. He came to know the
meaning of each varying bugle-call,
from reveille, when one began to paw
and stamp for breakfast, to mournful
taps, when lights went out, and the tents
became dark and silent. Also, one
learned to slow from a gallop into a
walk; when to wheel to the right or
to the left, and when to start on the
jump as the first notes of a charge were
sounded. It was better to learn the
bugle-calls, he found, than to wait for
a jerk on the bits or a prod from the
spurs.</p>

<p>No more was he terror-stricken, as he
had been on his first day in the cavalry,
at hearing behind him the thunder of
many hoofs. Having once become used
to the noise, he was even thrilled by the
swinging metre of it. A kind of wild
harmony was in it, something which
made one forget everything else. At
such times Pasha longed to break into
his long, wind-splitting lope, but he
learned that he must leave the others
no more than a pace or two behind,
although he could have easily outdistanced
them all.</p>

<p>Also, Pasha learned to stand under
fire. No more did he dance at the
crack of carbines or the zipp-zipp of
bullets. He could even hold his ground
when shells went screaming over him,
although this was hardest of all to bear.
One could not see them, but their sound,
like that of great birds in flight, was
something to try one's nerves. Pasha
strained his ears to catch the note of
each shell that came whizzing overhead,
and, as it passed, looked inquiringly over
his shoulder as if to ask, "Now what on
earth was that?"</p>

<p>But all this experience could not prepare
him for the happenings of that
never-to-be-forgotten day in June. There
had been a period full of hard riding and
ending with a long halt. For several
days hay and oats were brought with
some regularity. Pasha was even provided
with an apology for a stall. It
was made by leaning two rails against
a fence. Some hay was thrown between
the rails. This was a sorry substitute
for the roomy box-stall, filled with clean
straw, which Pasha always had at Gray
Oaks, but it was as good as any provided
for the Black Horse Cavalry.</p>

<p>And how many, many horses there
were! As far as Pasha could see in
either direction the line extended. Never
before had he seen so many horses at
one time. And men! The fields and
woods were full of them; some in brown
butternut, some in homespun gray, and
many in clothes having no uniformity
of color at all. "Mars" Clayton was
dressed better than most, for on his
butternut coat were shiny shoulder-straps,
and it was closed with shiny
buttons. Pasha took little pride in this.
He knew his master for a cruel and
heartless rider, and for nothing more.</p>

<p>One day there was a great parade,
when Pasha was carefully groomed for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
the first time in months. There were
bands playing and flags flying. Pasha,
forgetful of his ill-treatment and prancing
proudly at the head of a squadron
of coal-black horses, passed in review
before a big, bearded man wearing a
slouch hat fantastically decorated with
long plumes and sitting a great black
horse in the midst of a little knot of
officers.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Pasha was
awakened by the distant growl of heavy
guns. By daylight he was on the move,
thousands of other horses with him.
Nearer and nearer they rode to the
place where the guns were growling.
Sometimes they were on roads, sometimes
they crossed fields, and again they
plunged into the woods where the low
branches struck one's eyes and scratched
one's flanks. At last they broke clear
of the trees to come suddenly upon such
a scene as Pasha had never before
witnessed.</p>

<p>Far across the open field he could see
troop on troop of horses coming toward
him. They seemed to be pouring over
the crest of a low hill, as if driven onward
by some unseen force behind. Instantly
Pasha heard, rising from the throats of
thousands of riders, on either side and
behind him, that fierce, wild yell which
he had come to know meant the approach
of trouble. High and shrill and menacing
it rang as it was taken up and repeated
by those in the rear. Next the bugles
began to sound, and in quick obedience
the horses formed in line just on the
edge of the woods, a line which stretched
on either flank until one could hardly see
where it ended.</p>

<p>From the distant line came no answering
cry, but Pasha could hear the bugles
blowing and he could see the fronts
massing. Then came the order to charge
at a gallop. This set Pasha to tugging
eagerly at the bit, but for what reason
he did not know. He knew only that
he was part of a great and solid line of
men and horses sweeping furiously across
a field toward that other line which he
had seen pouring over the hill crest.</p>

<p>He could scarcely see at all now. The
thousands of hoofs had raised a cloud
of dust that not only enveloped the
onrushing line, but rolled before it.
Nor could Pasha hear anything save the
thunderous thud of many feet. Even
the shrieking of the shells was drowned.
But for the restraining bit Pasha would
have leaped forward and cleared the
line. Never had he been so stirred.
The inherited memory of countless desert
raids, made by his Arab ancestors, was
doing its work. For what seemed a
long time this continued, and then, in
the midst of the blind and frenzied race,
there loomed out of the thick air, as if
it had appeared by magic, the opposing
line.</p>

<p>Pasha caught a glimpse of something
which seemed like a heaving wall of
tossing heads and of foam-whitened necks
and shoulders. Here and there gleamed
red, distended nostrils and straining eyes.
Bending above was another wall, a wall
of dusty blue coats, of grim faces, and
of dust-powdered hats. Bristling above
all was a threatening crest of waving
blades.</p>

<p>What would happen when the lines
met? Almost before the query was
thought there came the answer. With
an earth-jarring crash they came together.
The lines wavered back from the shock
of impact and then the whole struggle
appeared to Pasha to centre about him.
Of course this was not so. But it was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
fact that the most conspicuous figure in
either line had been that of the cream-white
charger in the very centre of the
Black Horse regiment.</p>

<p>For one confused moment Pasha heard
about his ears the whistle and clash of
sabres, the spiteful crackle of small arms,
the snorting of horses, and the cries of
men. For an instant he was wedged
tightly in the frenzied mass, and then,
by one desperate leap, such as he had
learned on the hunting field, he shook
himself clear.</p>

<p>Not until some minutes later did
Pasha notice that the stirrups were
dangling empty and that the bridle-rein
hung loose on his neck. Then he knew
that at last he was free from "Mars"
Clayton. At the same time he felt himself
seized by an overpowering dread.
While conscious of a guiding hand on the
reins Pasha had abandoned himself to
the fierce joy of the charge. But now,
finding himself riderless in the midst of
a horrid din, he knew not what to do,
nor which way to turn. His only impulse
was to escape. But where? Lifting
high his fine head and snorting with
terror he rushed about, first this way
and then that, frantically seeking a way
out of this fog-filled field of dreadful
pandemonium. Now he swerved in his
course to avoid a charging squad, now
he was turned aside by prone objects at
sight of which he snorted fearfully.
Although the blades still rang and the
carbines still spoke, there were no more
to be seen either lines or order. Here
and there in the dust-clouds scurried
horses, some with riders and some
without, by twos, by fours, or in
squads of twenty or more. The sound
of shooting and slashing and shouting
filled the air.</p>

<p>To Pasha it seemed an eternity that
he had been tearing about the field when
he shied at the figure of a man sitting
on the ground. Pasha was about to
wheel and dash away when the man
called to him. Surely the tones were
familiar. With wide-open, sniffing nostrils
and trembling knees, Pasha, stopped and
looked hard at the man on the ground.</p>

<p>"Pasha! Pasha!" the man called
weakly. The voice sounded like that
of Mr. Dave.</p>

<p>"Come, boy! Come, boy!" said the
man in a coaxing tone, which recalled to
Pasha the lessons he had learned at
Gray Oaks years before. Still Pasha
sniffed and hesitated.</p>

<p>"Come here, Pasha, old fellow. For
God's sake, come here!"</p>

<p>There was no resisting this appeal.
Step by step Pasha went nearer. He
continued to tremble, for this man on
the ground, although his voice was that
of Mr. Dave, looked much different from
the one who had taught him tricks.
Besides, there was about him the scent
of fresh blood. Pasha could see the
stain of it on his blue trousers.</p>

<p>"Come, boy. Come, Pasha," insisted
the man on the ground, holding out an
encouraging hand. Slowly Pasha obeyed
until he could sniff the man's fingers.
Another step and the man was smoothing
his nose, still speaking gently and coaxingly
in a faint voice. In the end Pasha
was assured that the man was really
the Mr. Dave of old, and glad enough
Pasha was to know it.</p>

<p>"Now, Pasha," said Mr. Dave, "we'll
see if you've forgotten your tricks, and
may the good Lord grant you haven't.
Down, sir! Kneel, Pasha, kneel!"</p>

<p>It had been a long time since Pasha
had been asked to do this, a very long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
time; but here was Mr. Dave asking
him, in just the same tone as of old, and
in just the same way. So Pasha, forgetting
his terror under the soothing
spell of Mr. Dave's voice, forgetting the
fearful sights and sounds about him,
remembering only that here was the
Mr. Dave whom he loved, asking him
to do his old trick&mdash;well, Pasha knelt.</p>

<p>"Easy now, boy; steady!" Pasha
heard him say. Mr. Dave was dragging
himself along the ground to Pasha's
side. "Steady now, Pasha; steady,
boy!" He felt Mr. Dave's hand on
the pommel. "So-o-o, boy; so-o-o-o!"
Slowly, oh, so slowly, he felt Mr. Dave
crawling into the saddle, and although
Pasha's knees ached from the unfamiliar
strain, he stirred not a muscle until he
got the command, "Up, Pasha, up!"</p>

<p>Then, with a trusted hand on the
bridle-rein, Pasha joyfully bounded away
through the fog, until the battle-field
was left behind. Of the long ride that
ensued only Pasha knows, for Mr. Dave
kept his seat in the saddle more by
force of muscular habit than anything
else. A man who has learned to sleep
on horseback does not easily fall off,
even though he has not the full command
of his senses. Only for the first hour
or so did Pasha's rider do much toward
guiding their course. In hunting-horses,
however, the sense of direction is strong.
Pasha had it&mdash;especially for one point
of the compass. This point was south.
So, unknowing of the possible peril into
which he might be taking his rider,
south he went. How Pasha ever did
it, as I have said, only Pasha knows;
but in the end he struck the Richmond
Pike.</p>

<p>It was a pleading whinny which aroused
Miss Lou at early daybreak. Under her
window she saw Pasha, and on his back
a limp figure in a blue, dust-covered,
dark-stained uniform. And that was
how Pasha's cavalry career came to an
end. That one fierce charge was his
last.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the Washington home of a certain
Maine Congressman you may see, hung
in a place of honor and lavishly framed,
the picture of a horse. It is very creditably
done in oils, is this picture. It is
of a cream-white horse, with an arched
neck, clean, slim legs, and a splendid
flowing tail.</p>

<p>Should you have any favors of state
to ask of this Maine Congressman it
would be the wise thing, before stating
your request, to say something nice
about the horse in the picture. Then
the Congressman will probably say,
looking fondly at the picture: "I must
tell Lou&mdash;er&mdash;my wife, you know,
what you have said. Yes, that was
Pasha. He saved my neck at Brandy
Station. He was one-half Arab, Pasha
was, and the other half, sir, was
human."</p>

<div class="hang1">Louisa de la Ram&eacute;e (1839-1908), an English
novelist, is generally known by her pseudonym
"Ouida," which was the result of a
child's attempt to pronounce her first
name. Her novels had strong popular
qualities: intensely dramatic, with sentiment
rather high-pitched and always
verging on the sensational. The intense
human interest is constantly present in
her work and accounts for her great vogue.
Two of her stories, "The Dog of Flanders"
and "Moufflou," have gained a permanent
place in juvenile literature. They are
popular among sixth, seventh, and eighth
grade pupils.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />MOUFFLOU</h4>

<div class='center'>"OUIDA"</div>

<p>Moufflou's masters were some boys
and girls. They were very poor, but
they were very merry. They lived in
an old, dark, tumble-down place, and
their father had been dead five years;
their mother's care was all they knew;
and Tasso was the eldest of them all,
a lad of nearly twenty, and he was so
kind, so good, so laborious, so cheerful,
so gentle, that the children all younger
than he adored him. Tasso was a
gardener. Tasso, however, though the
eldest and mainly the bread-winner, was
not so much Moufflou's master as was
little Romolo, who was only ten, and a
cripple. Romolo, called generally Lolo,
had taught Moufflou all he knew; and
that all was a very great deal, for nothing
cleverer than was Moufflou had ever
walked upon four legs.</p>

<p>Why Moufflou?</p>

<p>Well, when the poodle had been given
to them by a soldier who was going back
to his home in Piedmont, he had been a
white woolly creature a year old, and
the children's mother, who was a Corsican
by birth, had said that he was just like
a <i>moufflon</i>, as they call sheep in Corsica.
White and woolly this dog remained,
and he became the handsomest and biggest
poodle in all the city, and the corruption
of Moufflou from Moufflon
remained the name by which he was
known; it was silly, perhaps, but it
suited him and the children, and Moufflou
he was.</p>

<p>They lived in an old quarter of Florence,
in that picturesque zigzag which
goes round the grand church of Or San
Michele, and which is almost more
Venetian than Tuscan in its mingling
of color, charm, stateliness, popular
confusion, and architectural majesty.
The tall old houses are weather-beaten
into the most delicious hues; the pavement
is enchantingly encumbered with
peddlers and stalls and all kinds of
trades going on in the open air, in that
bright, merry, beautiful Italian custom
which, alas, alas! is being driven away
by new-fangled laws which deem it
better for the people to be stuffed up
in close, stewing rooms without air, and
would fain do away with all the good-tempered
politics and the sensible philosophies
and the wholesome chatter
which the open-street trades and street
gossipry encourage, for it is good for the
populace to <i>sfogare</i> and in no other way
can it do so one-half so innocently.
Drive it back into musty shops, and
it is driven at once to mutter sedition.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But you want to hear about
Moufflou.</p>

<p>Well, Moufflou lived here in that
high house with the sign of the lamb in
wrought iron, which shows it was once a
warehouse of the old guild of the Arte
della Lana. They are all old houses
here, drawn round about that grand
church which I called once, and will
call again, like a mighty casket of
oxidized silver. A mighty casket indeed,
holding the Holy Spirit within it; and
with the vermilion and the blue and the
orange glowing in its niches and its
lunettes like enamels, and its statues
of the apostles strong and noble, like
the times in which they were created,&mdash;St.
Peter with his keys, and St. Mark
with his open book, and St. George
leaning on his sword, and others also,
solemn and austere as they, austere
though benign, for do they not guard
the White Tabernacle of Oreagna within?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>

<p>The church stands firm as a rock,
square as a fortress of stone, and the
winds and the waters of the skies may
beat about it as they will, they have no
power to disturb its sublime repose.
Sometimes I think of all the noble things
in all our Italy Or San Michele is the
noblest, standing there in its stern
magnificence, amidst people's hurrying
feet and noisy laughter, a memory of
God.</p>

<p>The little masters of Moufflou lived
right in its shadow, where the bridge
of stone spans the space between the
houses and the church high in mid-air;
and little Lolo loved the church with
a great love. He loved it in the morning-time,
when the sunbeams turned it into
dusky gold and jasper; he loved it in
the evening-time, when the lights of
its altars glimmered in the dark, and
the scent of its incense came out into
the street; he loved it in the great feasts,
when the huge clusters of lilies were
borne inside it; he loved it in the solemn
nights of winter; the flickering gleam
of the dull lamps shone on the robes of
an apostle, or the sculpture of a shield,
or the glow of a casement-moulding in
majolica. He loved it always, and,
without knowing why, he called it <i>la mia
chiesa</i>.</p>

<p>Lolo, being lame and of delicate health,
was not enabled to go to school or to
work, though he wove the straw covering
of wine-flasks and plaited the cane matting
with busy fingers. But for the
most part he did as he liked, and spent
most of his time sitting on the parapet
of Or San Michele, watching the venders
of earthenware at their trucks, or trotting
with his crutch (and he could trot a good
many miles when he chose) out with
Moufflou down a bit of the Stocking-makers'
Street, along under the arcades
of the Uffizi, and so over the Jewellers'
Bridge, and out of byways that he knew
into the fields on the hill-side upon the
other bank of Arno. Moufflou and he
would spend half the day&mdash;all the day&mdash;out
there in daffodil-time; and Lolo
would come home with great bundles
and sheaves of golden flowers, and he
and Moufflou were happy.</p>

<p>His mother never liked to say a harsh
word to Lolo, for he was lame through
her fault; she had let him fall in his
babyhood, and the mischief had been
done to his hip never again to be undone.
So she never raised her voice to him,
though she did often to the others,&mdash;to
curly-pated Cecco, and pretty black-eyed
Dina, and saucy Bice, and sturdy
Beppo, and even to the good, manly,
hard-working Tasso. Tasso was the
mainstay of the whole, though he was
but a gardener's lad, working in the green
Cascine at small wages. But all he
earned he brought home to his mother;
and he alone kept in order the lazy, high-tempered
Sandro, and he alone kept in
check Bice's love of finery, and he alone
could with shrewdness and care make
both ends meet and put <i>minestra</i> always
in the pot and bread always in the
cupboard.</p>

<p>When his mother thought, as she
thought indeed almost ceaselessly, that
with a few months he would be of the
age to draw his number, and might draw
a high one and be taken from her for
three years, the poor soul believed her
very heart would burst and break; and
many a day at twilight she would start
out unperceived and creep into the
great church and pour her soul forth in
supplication before the White Tabernacle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, pray as she would, no miracle
could happen to make Tasso free of
military service: if he drew a fatal number,
go he must, even though he take
all the lives of them to their ruin with
him.</p>

<p>One morning Lolo sat as usual on the
parapet of the church, Moufflou beside
him. It was a brilliant morning in
September. The men at the hand-barrows
and at the stall were selling the
crockery, the silk handkerchiefs, and the
straw hats which form the staple of the
commerce that goes on round about Or
San Michele,&mdash;very blithe, good-natured,
gay commerce, for the most part, not got
through, however, of course, without
bawling and screaming, and shouting
and gesticulating, as if the sale of a
penny pipkin or a twopenny pie-pan
were the occasion for the exchange of
many thousands of pounds sterling and
cause for the whole world's commotion.
It was about eleven o'clock; the poor
petitioners were going in for alms to the
house of the fraternity of San Giovanni
Battista; the barber at the corner was
shaving a big man with a cloth tucked
about his chin, and his chair set well
out on the pavement; the sellers of the
pipkins and pie-pans were screaming till
they were hoarse, "<i>Un soldo l'uno, due
soldi tre!</i>" big bronze bells were booming
till they seemed to clang right up to
the deep-blue sky; some brethren of
the Misericordia went by bearing a
black bier; a large sheaf of glowing
flowers&mdash;dahlias, zinnias, asters, and
daturas&mdash;was borne through the huge
arched door of the church near St.
Mark and his open book. Lolo looked
on at it all, and so did Moufflou, and
a stranger looked at them as he left
the church.</p>

<p>"You have a handsome poodle there,
my little man," he said to Lolo, in a
foreigner's too distinct and careful Italian.</p>

<p>"Moufflou is beautiful," said Lolo,
with pride. "You should see him when
he is just washed; but we can only wash
him on Sundays, because then Tasso
is at home."</p>

<p>"How old is your dog?"</p>

<p>"Three years old."</p>

<p>"Does he do any tricks?"</p>

<p>"Does he!" said Lolo, with a very
derisive laugh: "why, Moufflou can do
anything! He can walk on two legs
ever so long; make ready, present, and
fire; die; waltz; beg, of course; shut
a door; make a wheelbarrow of himself;
there is nothing he will not do. Would
you like to see him do something?"</p>

<p>"Very much," said the foreigner.</p>

<p>To Moufflou and to Lolo the street
was the same thing as home; this cheery
<i>piazzetta</i> by the church, so utterly empty
sometimes, and sometimes so noisy and
crowded, was but the wider threshold of
their home to both the poodle and the child.</p>

<p>So there, under the lofty and stately
walls of the old church, Lolo put Moufflou
through his exercises. They were second
nature to Moufflou, as to most poodles.
He had inherited his address at them
from clever parents, and, as he had never
been frightened or coerced, all his lessons
and acquirements were but play to him.
He acquitted himself admirably, and the
crockery-venders came and looked on,
and a sacristan came out of the church
and smiled, and the barber left his
customer's chin all in a lather while
he laughed, for the good folk of the
quarter were all proud of Moufflou and
never tired of him, and the pleasant,
easy-going, good-humored disposition of
the Tuscan populace is so far removed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
from the stupid buckram and whale-bone
in which the new-fangled democracy
wants to imprison it.</p>

<p>The stranger also was much diverted
by Moufflou's talents, and said, half
aloud, "How this clever dog would
amuse poor Victor! Would you bring
your poodle to please a sick child I
have at home!" he said, quite aloud, to
Lolo, who smiled and answered that he
would. Where was the sick child?</p>

<p>"At the Gran Bretagna; not far off,"
said the gentleman. "Come this afternoon,
and ask for me by this name."</p>

<p>He dropped his card and a couple of
francs into Lolo's hand, and went his
way. Lolo, with Moufflou scampering
after him, dashed into his own house,
and stumped up the stairs, his crutch
making a terrible noise on the stone.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother! see what I have
got because Moufflou did his tricks,"
he shouted. "And now you can buy
those shoes you want so much, and the
coffee that you miss so of a morning,
and the new linen for Tasso, and the
shirts for Sandro."</p>

<p>For to the mind of Lolo two francs
was as two millions,&mdash;source unfathomable
of riches inexhaustible!</p>

<p>With the afternoon he and Moufflou
trotted down the arcades of the Uffizi
and down the Lung' Arno to the hotel
of the stranger, and, showing the stranger's
card, which Lolo could not read,
they were shown at once into a great
chamber, all gilding and fresco and
velvet furniture.</p>

<p>But Lolo, being a little Florentine,
was never troubled by externals, or
daunted by mere sofas and chairs: he
stood and looked around him with
perfect composure; and Moufflou, whose
attitude, when he was not romping, was
always one of magisterial gravity, sat
on his haunches and did the same.</p>

<p>Soon the foreigner he had seen in the
forenoon entered and spoke to him, and
led him into another chamber, where
stretched on a couch was a little wan-faced
boy about seven years old; a
pretty boy, but so pallid, so wasted, so
helpless. This poor little boy was heir
to a great name and a great fortune,
but all the science in the world could
not make him strong enough to run
about among the daisies, or able to draw
a single breath without pain. A feeble
smile lit up his face as he saw Moufflou
and Lolo; then a shadow chased it
away.</p>

<p>"Little boy is lame like me," he said,
in a tongue Lolo did not understand.</p>

<p>"Yes, but he is a strong little boy,
and can move about, as perhaps the
suns of his country will make you do,"
said the gentleman, who was the poor
little boy's father. "He has brought you
his poodle to amuse you. What a handsome
dog! is it not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>buffins!</i>" said the poor little
fellow, stretching out his wasted hands
to Moufflou, who submitted his leonine
crest to the caress.</p>

<p>Then Lolo went through the performance,
and Moufflou acquitted himself
ably as ever; and the little invalid
laughed and shouted with his tiny thin
voice, and enjoyed it all immensely, and
rained cakes and biscuits on both the
poodle and its master. Lolo crumped
the pastries with willing white teeth,
and Moufflou did no less. Then they
got up to go, and the sick child on the
couch burst into fretful lamentations and
outcries.</p>

<p>"I want the dog! I will have the dog!"
was all he kept repeating.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p>But Lolo did not know what he
said, and was only sorry to see him so
unhappy.</p>

<p>"You shall have the dog to-morrow,"
said the gentleman, to pacify his little
son; and he hurried Lolo and Moufflou
out of the room, and consigned them to
a servant, having given Lolo five francs
this time.</p>

<p>"Why, Moufflou," said Lolo, with a
chuckle of delight, "if we could find a
foreigner every day, we could eat meat
at supper, Moufflou, and go to the
theatre every evening?"</p>

<p>And he and his crutch clattered home
with great eagerness and excitement,
and Moufflou trotted on his four frilled
feet, the blue bow with which Bice had
tied up his curls on the top of his head,
fluttering in the wind. But, alas! even
his five francs could bring no comfort
at home. He found his whole family
wailing and mourning in utterly inconsolable
distress.</p>

<p>Tasso had drawn his number that
morning, and the number was seven,
and he must go and be a conscript for
three years.</p>

<p>The poor young man stood in the
midst of his weeping brothers and sisters,
with his mother leaning against his
shoulder, and down his own brown
cheeks the tears were falling. He must
go, and lose his place in the public gardens,
and leave his people to starve as
they might, and be put in a tomfool's
jacket, and drafted off among cursing
and swearing and strange faces, friendless,
homeless, miserable! And the
mother,&mdash;what would become of the
mother?</p>

<p>Tasso was the best of lads and the
mildest. He was quite happy sweeping
up the leaves in the long alleys of the
Cascine, or mowing the green lawns
under the ilex avenues, and coming
home at supper-time, among the merry
little people and the good woman that
he loved. He was quite contented; he
wanted nothing, only to be let alone; and
they would not let him alone. They
would haul him away to put a heavy
musket in his hand and a heavy knapsack
on his back, and drill him, and
curse him, and make him into a human
target, a live popinjay.</p>

<p>No one had any heed for Lolo and
his five francs, and Moufflou, understanding
that some great sorrow had
fallen on his friends, sat down and lifted
up his voice and howled.</p>

<p>Tasso must go away!&mdash;that was all
they understood. For three long years
they must go without the sight of his
face, the aid of his strength, the pleasure
of his smile: Tasso must go! When
Lolo understood the calamity that had
befallen them, he gathered Moufflou up
against his breast, and sat down too on
the floor beside him and cried as if he
would never stop crying.</p>

<p>There was no help for it; it was one
of those misfortunes which are, as we
say in Italian, like a tile tumbled on
the head. The tile drops from a height,
and the poor head bows under the unseen
blow. That is all.</p>

<p>"What is the use of that?" said the
mother, passionately, when Lolo showed
her his five francs. "It will not buy
Tasso's discharge."</p>

<p>Lolo felt that his mother was cruel
and unjust, and crept to bed with
Moufflou. Moufflou always slept on
Lolo's feet.</p>

<p>The next morning Lolo got up before
sunrise, and he and Moufflou accompanied
Tasso to his work in the Cascine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span></p>

<p>Lolo loved his brother, and clung to every
moment whilst they could still be together.</p>

<p>"Can nothing keep you, Tasso?" he
said, despairingly, as they went down
the leafy aisles, whilst the Arno water
was growing golden as the sun rose.</p>

<p>Tasso sighed.</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear. Unless Gesu would
send me a thousand francs to buy a
substitute."</p>

<p>And he knew he might as well have
said, "If one could coin gold ducats
out of the sunbeams on Arno water."</p>

<p>Lolo was very sorrowful as he lay on
the grass in the meadow where Tasso
was at work, and the poodle lay stretched
beside him.</p>

<p>When Lolo went home to dinner (Tasso
took his wrapped in a handkerchief) he
found his mother very agitated and
excited. She was laughing one moment,
crying the next. She was passionate
and peevish, tender and jocose by turns;
there was something forced and feverish
about her which the children felt but
did not comprehend. She was a woman
of not very much intelligence, and she
had a secret, and she carried it ill, and
knew not what to do with it; but they
could not tell that. They only felt a
vague sense of disturbance and timidity
at her unwonted manner.</p>

<p>The meal over (it was only bean-soup,
and that is soon eaten), the mother said
sharply to Lolo, "Your aunt Anita wants
you this afternoon. She has to go out,
and you are needed to stay with the
children: be off with you."</p>

<p>Lolo was an obedient child; he took
his hat and jumped up as quickly as
his halting hip would let him. He
called Moufflou, who was asleep.</p>

<p>"Leave the dog," said his mother,
sharply. "'Nita will not have him
messing and carrying mud about her
nice clean rooms. She told me so.
Leave him. I say."</p>

<p>"Leave Moufflou!" echoed Lolo, for
never in all Moufflou's life had Lolo
parted from him. Leave Moufflou! He
stared open-eyed and open-mouthed at
his mother. What could have come to
her?</p>

<p>"Leave him, I say," she repeated,
more sharply than ever. "Must I speak
twice to my own children? Be off with
you, and leave the dog, I say."</p>

<p>And she clutched Moufflou by his
long silky mane and dragged him backwards,
whilst with the other hand
she thrust out of the door Lolo and
Bice.</p>

<p>Lolo began to hammer with his crutch
at the door thus closed on him; but
Bice coaxed and entreated him.</p>

<p>"Poor mother has been so worried
about Tasso," she pleaded. "And what
harm can come to Moufflou? And I do
think he was tired, Lolo; the Cascine
is a long way; and it is quite true that
Aunt 'Nita never liked him."</p>

<p>So by one means and another she
coaxed her brother away; and they
went almost in silence to where their
Aunt Anita dwelt, which was across the
river, near the dark-red bell-shaped dome
of Santa Spirito.</p>

<p>It was true that her aunt had wanted
them to mind her room and her babies
whilst she was away carrying home some
lace to a villa outside the Roman gate,
for she was a lace-washer and clear-starcher
by trade. There they had to
stay in the little dark room with the
two babies, with nothing to amuse the
time except the clang of the bells of the
church of the Holy Spirit, and the voices
of the lemonade-sellers shouting in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
street below. Aunt Anita did not get
back till it was more than dusk, and
the two children trotted homeward hand
in hand, Lolo's leg dragging itself painfully
along, for without Moufflou's white
figure dancing on before him he felt
very tired indeed. It was pitch dark
when they got to Or San Michele, and
the lamps burned dully.</p>

<p>Lolo stumped up the stairs wearily,
with a vague, dull fear at his small
heart.</p>

<p>"Moufflou, Moufflou!" he called.
Where was Moufflou? Always at the
first sound of his crutch the poodle came
flying towards him. "Moufflou, Moufflou!"
he called all the way up the long,
dark twisting stone stair. He pushed
open the door, and he called again,
"Moufflou, Moufflou!"</p>

<p>But no dog answered to his call.</p>

<p>"Mother, where is Moufflou?" he
asked, staring with blinking, dazzled
eyes into the oil-lit room where his mother
sat knitting. Tasso was not then home
from work. His mother went on with
her knitting; there was an uneasy look
on her face.</p>

<p>"Mother, what have you done with
Moufflou, <i>my</i> Moufflou?" said Lolo, with
a look that was almost stern on his
ten-year-old face.</p>

<p>Then his mother, without looking up
and moving her knitting-needles very
rapidly, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Moufflou is sold!"</p>

<p>And little Dina, who was a quick, pert
child, cried, with a shrill voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother has sold him for a thousand
francs to the foreign gentleman."</p>

<p>"Sold him!"</p>

<p>Lolo grew white and grew cold as ice;
he stammered, threw up his hands over
his head, gasped a little for breath, then
fell down in a dead swoon, his poor
useless limb doubled under him.</p>

<p>When Tasso came home that sad night
and found his little brother shivering,
moaning, and half delirious, and when
he heard what had been done, he was
sorely grieved.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, how could you do it?"
he cried. "Poor, poor Moufflou! and
Lolo loves him so!"</p>

<p>"I have got the money," said his
mother, feverishly, "and you will not
need to go for a soldier: we can buy
your substitute. What is a poodle, that
you mourn about it? We can get
another poodle for Lolo."</p>

<p>"Another will not be Moufflou,"
said Tasso, and yet was seized with
such a frantic happiness himself at the
knowledge that he would not need go
to the army, that he too felt as if he were
drunk on new wine, and had not the
heart to rebuke his mother.</p>

<p>"A thousand francs!" he muttered;
"a thousand francs! <i>Dio mio!</i> Who
could ever have fancied anybody would
have given such a price for a common
white poodle? One would think the
gentleman had bought the church and
the tabernacle!"</p>

<p>"Fools and their money are soon
parted," said his mother, with cross
contempt.</p>

<p>It was true: she had sold Moufflou.</p>

<p>The English gentleman had called on
her while Lolo and the dog had been in
the Cascine, and had said that he was
desirous of buying the poodle, which had
so diverted his sick child that the little
invalid would not be comforted unless
he possessed it. Now, at any other time
the good woman would have sturdily
refused any idea of selling Moufflou; but
that morning the thousand francs which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
would buy Tasso's substitute were forever
in her mind and before her eyes.
When she heard the foreigner her heart
gave a great leap, and her head swam
giddily, and she thought, in a spasm
of longing&mdash;if she could get those
thousand francs! But though she was
so dizzy and so upset she retained her
grip on her native Florentine shrewdness.
She said nothing of her need of
the money; not a syllable of her sore
distress. On the contrary, she was coy
and wary, affected great reluctance to
part with her pet, invented a great offer
made for him by a director of a circus,
and finally let fall a hint that less than
a thousand francs she could never take
for poor Moufflou.</p>

<p>The gentleman assented with so much
willingness to the price that she instantly
regretted not having asked double. He
told her that if she would take the poodle
that afternoon to his hotel the money
should be paid to her; so she despatched
her children after their noonday meal in
various directions, and herself took
Moufflou to his doom. She could not
believe her senses when ten hundred-franc
notes were put into her hand.
She scrawled her signature, Rosina Calabucci,
to a formal receipt, and went
away, leaving Moufflou in his new
owner's rooms, and hearing his howls
and moans pursue her all the way down
the staircase and out into the air.</p>

<p>She was not easy at what she had
done.</p>

<p>"It seemed," she said to herself, "like
selling a Christian."</p>

<p>But then to keep her eldest son at
home,&mdash;what a joy that was! On the
whole, she cried so and laughed so as
she went down the Lung' Arno that
once or twice people looked at her,
thinking her out of her senses, and a
guard spoke to her angrily.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lolo was sick and delirious
with grief. Twenty times he got out
of his bed and screamed to be allowed
to go with Moufflou, and twenty times
his mother and his brothers put him
back again and held him down and tried
in vain to quiet him.</p>

<p>The child was beside himself with
misery. "Moufflou! Moufflou!" he
sobbed at every moment; and by night
he was in a raging fever, and when his
mother, frightened, ran in and called in
the doctor of the quarter, that worthy
shook his head and said something as
to a shock of the nervous system, and
muttered a long word,&mdash;"meningitis."</p>

<p>Lolo took a hatred to the sight of
Tasso, and thrust him away, and his
mother too.</p>

<p>"It is for you Moufflou is sold," he
said, with his little teeth and hands tight
clinched.</p>

<p>After a day or two Tasso felt as if he
could not bear his life, and went down to
the hotel to see if the foreign gentleman
would allow him to have Moufflou back
for half an hour to quiet his little brother
by a sight of him. But at the hotel he
was told that the <i>Milord Inglese</i> who
had bought the dog of Rosina Calabucci
had gone that same night of the purchase
to Rome, to Naples, to Palermo,
<i>chi sa?</i></p>

<p>"And Moufflou with him?" asked
Tasso.</p>

<p>"The <i>barbone</i> he had bought went
with him," said the porter of the hotel.
"Such a beast! Howling, shrieking,
raging all the day, and all the paint
scratched off the <i>salon</i> door."</p>

<p>Poor Moufflou! Tasso's heart was
heavy as he heard of that sad helpless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
misery of their bartered favorite and
friend.</p>

<p>"What matter?" said his mother,
fiercely, when he told her. "A dog is
a dog. They will feed him better than
we could. In a week he will have forgotten&mdash;<i>che!</i>"</p>

<p>But Tasso feared that Moufflou would
not forget. Lolo certainly would not.
The doctor came to the bedside twice a
day, and ice and water were kept on
the aching hot little head that had got
the malady with the long name, and for
the chief part of the time Lolo lay quiet,
dull, and stupid, breathing heavily, and
then at intervals cried and sobbed and
shrieked hysterically for Moufflou.</p>

<p>"Can you not get what he calls for
to quiet him with a sight of it?" said
the doctor. But that was not possible,
and poor Rosina covered her head with
her apron and felt a guilty creature.</p>

<p>"Still, you will not go to the army,"
she said to Tasso. Clinging to that
immense joy for her consolation. "Only
think! we can pay Guido Squarcione to
go for you. He always said he would
go if anybody would pay him. Oh, my
Tasso, surely to keep you is worth a
dog's life!"</p>

<p>"And Lolo's?" said Tasso, gloomily.
"Nay, mother, it works ill to meddle too
much with fate. I drew my number; I
was bound to go. Heaven would have
made it up to you somehow."</p>

<p>"Heaven sent me the foreigner; the
Madonna's own self sent him to ease a
mother's pain," said Rosina, rapidly
and angrily. "There are the thousand
francs safe to hand in the <i>cassone</i>, and
what, pray, is it we miss? Only a dog
like a sheep, that brought gallons of
mud in with him every time it rained,
and ate as much as any one of you."</p>

<p>"But Lolo?" said Tasso, under his
breath.</p>

<p>His mother was so irritated and so
tormented by her own conscience that
she upset all the cabbage broth into the
burning charcoal.</p>

<p>"Lolo was always a little fool, thinking
of nothing but the church and the
dog and nasty field-flowers," she said,
angrily. "I humored him ever too
much because of the hurt to his hip,
and so&mdash;and so&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then the poor soul made matters
worse by dropping her tears into the
saucepan, and fanning the charcoal so
furiously that the flame caught her fan
of cane-leaves, and would have burned
her arm had not Tasso been there.</p>

<p>"You are my prop and safety always.
Who would not have done what I did?
Not Santa Felicita herself," she said,
with a great sob.</p>

<p>But all this did not cure poor Lolo.</p>

<p>The days and the weeks of the golden
autumn weather passed away, and he
was always in danger, and the small
close room where he slept with Sandro
and Beppo and Tasso was not one to
cure such an illness as had now beset
him. Tasso went to his work with a
sick heart in the Cascine, where the colchicum
was all lilac among the meadow
grass, and the ashes and elms were
taking their first flush of the coming
autumnal change. He did not think
Lolo would ever get well, and the good
lad felt as if he had been the murderer
of his little brother.</p>

<p>True, he had had no hand or voice
in the sale of Moufflou, but Moufflou
had been sold for his sake. It made him
feel half guilty, very unhappy, quite
unworthy of all the sacrifice that had
been made for him. "Nobody should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
meddle with fate," thought Tasso, who
knew his grandfather had died in San
Bonifazio because he had driven himself
mad over the dream-book trying to get
lucky numbers for the lottery and become
a rich man at a stroke.</p>

<p>It was rapture, indeed, to know that
he was free of the army for a time at
least, that he might go on undisturbed
at his healthful labor, and get a rise in
wages as time went on, and dwell in
peace with his family, and perhaps&mdash;perhaps
in time earn enough to marry
pretty flaxen-haired Biondina, the daughter
of the barber in the piazzetta. It was
rapture indeed; but then poor Moufflou!&mdash;and
poor, poor Lolo! Tasso felt as if
he had bought his own exemption by
seeing his little brother and the good dog
torn in pieces and buried alive for his
service.</p>

<p>And where was poor Moufflou?</p>

<p>Gone far away somewhere south in
the hurrying, screeching, vomiting, braying
train it made Tasso giddy only to
look at as it rushed by the green meadows
beyond the Cascine on its way to the sea.</p>

<p>"If he could see the dog he cries so
for, it might save him," said the doctor,
who stood with grave face watching
Lolo.</p>

<p>But that was beyond any one's power.
No one could tell where Moufflou was.
He might be carried away to England,
to France, to Russia, to America,&mdash;who
could say? They did not know where
his purchaser had gone. Moufflou even
might be dead.</p>

<p>The poor mother, when the doctor said
that, went and looked at the ten hundred-franc
notes that were once like angels'
faces to her, and said to them,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, you children of Satan, why did
you tempt me? I sold the poor, innocent,
trustful beast to get you, and now my
child is dying!"</p>

<p>Her eldest son would stay at home,
indeed; but if this little lame one died!
Rosina Calabucci would have given up
the notes and consented never to own
five francs in her life if only she could
have gone back over the time and kept
Moufflou, and seen his little master
running out with him into the sunshine.</p>

<p>More than a month went by, and Lolo
lay in the same state, his yellow hair
shorn, his eyes dilated and yet stupid,
life kept in him by a spoonful of milk, a
lump of ice, a drink of lemon-water;
always muttering, when he spoke at all,
"Moufflou, Moufflou, <i>dov' e</i> Moufflou?"
and lying for days together in somnolence
and unconsciousness, with the fire eating
at his brain and the weight lying on it
like a stone.</p>

<p>The neighbors were kind, and brought
fruit and the like, and sat up with him,
and chattered so all at once in one continuous
brawl that they were enough in
themselves to kill him, for such is ever
the Italian fashion of sympathy in all
illness.</p>

<p>But Lolo did not get well, did not
even seem to see the light at all, or to
distinguish any sounds around him; and
the doctor in plain words told Rosina
Calabucci that her little boy must die.
Die, and the church so near! She could
not believe it. Could St. Mark, and
St. George, and the rest that he had
loved so do nothing for him? No, said
the doctor, they could do nothing; the
dog might do something, since the brain
had so fastened on that one idea; but
then they had sold the dog.</p>

<p>"Yes; I sold him!" said the poor
mother, breaking into floods of remorseful
tears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span></p>

<p>So at last the end drew so nigh that
one twilight time the priest came out
of the great arched door that is next
it. Mark, with the Host uplifted, and a
little acolyte ringing the bell before it,
and passed across the piazzetta, and
went up the dark staircase of Rosina's
dwelling, and passed through the weeping,
terrified children, and went to the
bedside of Lolo.</p>

<p>Lolo was unconscious, but the holy
man touched his little body and limbs
with the sacred oil, and prayed over
him, and then stood sorrowful with
bowed head.</p>

<p>Lolo had had his first communion in
the summer, and in his preparation for
it had shown an intelligence and devoutness
that had won the priest's gentle
heart.</p>

<p>Standing there, the holy man commended
the innocent soul to God. It
was the last service to be rendered to
him save that very last of all when the
funeral office should be read above his
little grave among the millions of nameless
dead at the sepulchres of the poor
at Trebbiano.</p>

<p>All was still as the priest's voice
ceased; only the sobs of the mother
and of the children broke the stillness
as they kneeled; the hand of Biondina
had stolen into Tasso's.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there was a loud scuffling
noise; hurrying feet came patter, patter,
patter up the stairs, a ball of mud and
dust flew over the heads of the kneeling
figures, fleet as the wind Moufflou
dashed through the room and leaped
upon the bed.</p>

<p>Lolo opened his heavy eyes, and a
sudden light of consciousness gleamed
in them like a sunbeam. "Moufflou!"
he murmured, in his little thin faint
voice. The dog pressed close to his
breast and kissed his wasted face.</p>

<p>Moufflou was come home!</p>

<p>And Lolo came home too, for death
let go its hold upon him. Little by little,
very faintly and flickeringly and very
uncertainly at the first, life returned to
the poor little body, and reason to the
tormented, heated little brain. Moufflou
was his physician; Moufflou, who,
himself a skeleton under his matted
curls, would not stir from his side and
looked at him all day long with two beaming
brown eyes full of unutterable love.</p>

<p>Lolo was happy; he asked no questions,&mdash;was
too weak, indeed, even to
wonder. He had Moufflou; that was
enough.</p>

<p>Alas! though they dared not say so
in his hearing, it was not enough for his
elders. His mother and Tasso knew
that the poodle had been sold and paid
for; that they could lay no claim to
keep him; and that almost certainly
his purchaser would seek him out and
assert his indisputable right to him.
And then how would Lolo ever bear
that second parting?&mdash;Lolo, so weak
that he weighed no more than if he had
been a little bird.</p>

<p>Moufflou had, no doubt, traveled a
long distance and suffered much. He
was but skin and bone; he bore the
marks of blows and kicks; his once
silken hair was all discolored and matted;
he had, no doubt, traveled far. But
then his purchaser would be sure to ask
for him, soon or late, at his old home;
and then? Well, then if they did not
give him up themselves, the law would
make them.</p>

<p>Rosina Calabucci and Tasso, though
they dared say nothing before any of
the children, felt their hearts in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
mouths at every step on the stair, and
the first interrogation of Tasso every
evening when he came from his work
was, "Has any one come for Moufflou?"
For ten days no one came, and their
first terrors lulled a little.</p>

<p>On the eleventh morning, a feast-day,
on which Tasso was not going to his
labors in the Cascine, there came a
person, with a foreign look, who said the
words they so much dreaded to hear:
"Has the poodle that you sold to an
English gentleman come back to you?"</p>

<p>Yes: his English master claimed him!</p>

<p>The servant said that they had missed
the dog in Rome a few days after buying
him and taking him there; that he had
been searched for in vain, and that his
master had thought it possible the animal
might have found his way back to his
old home: there had been stories of such
wonderful sagacity in dogs: anyhow, he
had sent for him on the chance; he was
himself back on the Lung' Arno. The
servant pulled from his pocket a chain,
and said his orders were to take the poodle
away at once: the little sick gentleman
had fretted very much about his loss.</p>

<p>Tasso heard in a very agony of despair.
To take Moufflou away now would be
to kill Lolo,&mdash;Lolo so feeble still, so
unable to understand, so passionately
alive to every sight and sound of Moufflou,
lying for hours together motionless
with his hand buried in the poodle's
curls, saying nothing, only smiling now
and then, and murmuring a word or two
in Moufflou's ear.</p>

<p>"The dog did come home," said Tasso,
at length, in a low voice; "angels must
have shown him the road, poor beast!
From Rome! Only to think of it, from
Rome! And he a dumb thing! I tell
you he is here, honestly: so will you not
trust me just so far as this? Will you
let me go with you and speak to the
English lord before you take the dog
away? I have a little brother sorely
ill&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could not speak more, for tears
that choked his voice.</p>

<p>At last the messenger agreed so far
as this: Tasso might go first and see
the master, but he would stay here and
have a care they did not spirit the dog
away,&mdash;"for a thousand francs were
paid for him," added the man, "and a
dog that can come all the way from
Rome by itself must be an uncanny
creature."</p>

<p>Tasso thanked him, went up-stairs,
was thankful that his mother was at
mass and could not dispute with him,
took the ten hundred-franc notes from
the old oak <i>cassone</i>, and with them in
his breast-pocket walked out into the
air. He was but a poor working lad,
but he had made up his mind to do an
heroic act. He went straightway to the
hotel where the English <i>milord</i> was,
and when he had got there remembered
that still he did not know the name of
Moufflou's owner; but the people of
the hotel knew him as Rosina Calabucci's
son, and guessed what he wanted, and
said the gentleman who had lost the
poodle was within, up-stairs, and they
would tell him.</p>

<p>Tasso waited some half-hour with his
heart beating sorely against the packet
of hundred-franc notes. At last he was
beckoned up-stairs, and there he saw a
foreigner with a mild fair face, and a
very lovely lady, and a delicate child
who was lying on a couch. "Moufflou!
Where is Moufflou?" cried the little
child, impatiently, as he saw the youth
enter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span></p>

<p>Tasso took his hat off, and stood in
the door-way an embrowned, healthy,
not ungraceful figure, in his working-clothes
of rough blue stuff.</p>

<p>"If you please, most illustrious," he
stammered, "poor Moufflou has come
home."</p>

<p>The child gave a cry of delight; the
gentleman and lady one of wonder.
Come home! All the way from Rome!</p>

<p>"Yes, he has, most illustrious," said
Tasso, gaining courage and eloquence;
"and now I want to beg something of
you. We are poor, and I drew a bad
number, and it was for that my mother
sold Moufflou. For myself, I did not
know anything of it; but she thought
she would buy my substitute, and of
course she could; but Moufflou is come
home, and my little brother Lolo, the
little boy your most illustrious first saw
playing with the poodle, fell ill of the
grief of losing Moufflou, and for a month
has lain saying nothing sensible, but
only calling for the dog, and my old
grandfather died of worrying himself mad
over the lottery numbers, and Lolo was
so near dying that the Blessed Host had
been brought, and the holy oil had been
put on him, when all at once there rushes
in Moufflou, skin and bone, and covered
with mud, and at the sight of him Lolo
comes back to his senses, and that is
now ten days ago, and though Lolo is
still as weak as a new-born thing, he
is always sensible, and takes what we
give him to eat, and lies always looking
at Moufflou, and smiling, and saying,
'Moufflou! Moufflou!' and, most illustrious,
I know well you have bought
the dog, and the law is with you, and
by the law you claim it, but I thought
perhaps, as Lolo loves him so, you would
let us keep the dog, and would take back
the thousand francs, and myself I will
go and be a soldier, and heaven will
take care of them all somehow."</p>

<p>Then Tasso, having said all this in
one breathless, monotonous recitative,
took the thousand francs out of his
breast-pocket and held them out timidly
towards the foreign gentleman, who
motioned them aside and stood silent.</p>

<p>"Did you understand, Victor?" he
said, at last, to his little son.</p>

<p>The child hid his face in his cushions.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did understand something:
let Lolo keep him; Moufflou was not
happy with me."</p>

<p>But he burst out crying as he said it.</p>

<p>Moufflou had run away from him.</p>

<p>Moufflou had never loved him, for
all his sweet cakes and fond caresses
and platefuls of delicate savory meats.
Moufflou had run away and found his
own road over two hundred miles and
more to go back to some little hungry
children, who never had enough to eat
themselves and so, certainly, could never
give enough to eat to the dog. Poor
little boy! He was so rich and so pampered
and so powerful, and yet he could
never make Moufflou love him!</p>

<p>Tasso, who understood nothing that
was said, laid the ten hundred-franc
notes down on a table near him.</p>

<p>"If you would take them, most illustrious,
and give me back what my
mother wrote when she sold Moufflou,"
he said, timidly, "I would pray for you
night and day, and Lolo would too;
and as for the dog, we will get a puppy
and train him for your little <i>signorino;</i>
they can all do tricks, more or less, it
comes by nature; and as for me, I will
go to the army willingly; it is not right
to interfere with fate; my old grandfather
died mad because he would try<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
to be a rich man, by dreaming about it
and pulling destiny by the ears, as if
she were a kicking mule; only, I do
pray of you, do not take away Moufflou.
And to think he trotted all those miles
and miles, and you carried him by train
too, and he never could have seen the
road, and he had no power of speech
to ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tasso broke down again in his eloquence,
and drew the back of his hand
across his wet eyelashes.</p>

<p>The English gentleman was not altogether
unmoved.</p>

<p>"Poor faithful dog!" he said, with a
sigh. "I am afraid we were very cruel
to him, meaning to be kind. No; we
will not claim him, and I do not think
you should go for a soldier; you seem
so good a lad, and your mother must
need you. Keep the money, my boy,
and in payment you shall train up the
puppy you talk of, and bring him to
my little boy. I will come and see your
mother and Lolo to-morrow. All the way
from Rome! What wonderful sagacity!
what matchless fidelity!"</p>

<p>You can imagine, without any telling
of mine, the joy that reigned in Moufflou's
home when Tasso returned thither
with the money and the good tidings
both. His substitute was bought without
a day's delay, and Lolo rapidly
recovered. As for Moufflou, he could
never tell them his troubles, his wanderings,
his difficulties, his perils; he could
never tell them by what miraculous
knowledge he had found his way across
Italy, from the gates of Rome to the
gates of Florence. But he soon grew
plump again, and merry, and his love
for Lolo was yet greater than before.</p>

<p>By the winter all the family went to
live on an estate near Spezia that the
English gentleman had purchased, and
there Moufflou was happier than ever.
The little English boy is gaining strength
in the soft air, and he and Lolo are
great friends, and play with Moufflou
and the poodle puppy half the day
upon the sunny terraces and under the
green orange boughs. Tasso is one of
the gardeners there; he will have to
serve as a soldier probably in some
category or another, but he is safe for
the time, and is happy. Lolo, whose
lameness will always exempt him from
military service, when he grows to be
a man means to be a florist, and a great
one. He has learned to read, as the
first step on the road of his ambition.</p>

<p>"But oh, Moufflou, how <i>did</i> you find
your way home?" he asks the dog a
hundred times a week.</p>

<p>How indeed!</p>

<p>No one ever knew how Moufflou had
made that long journey on foot, so many
weary miles; but beyond a doubt he
had done it alone and unaided, for if
any one had helped him they would
have come home with him to claim the
reward.</p>

<h4><br />BIRD HABITS</h4>

<div class='center'>OLIVE THORNE MILLER</div>


<div class='center'><br />I. WHERE HE SLEEPS</div>

<p>Most birds sleep on their feet.</p>

<p>You know how a canary goes to sleep,
all puffed out like a ball, with his head
buried in the feathers of his shoulder.
He may stick his bill over behind the
top of the wing, but he never "puts his
head under his wing," as you have heard.</p>

<p>Sometimes he stands straight up on
one leg, with the other drawn up out of
sight in his feathers, but more often he
sits down on the perch, still resting on
his feet. Most wild birds of the perching
kind sleep in the same way.</p>

<p>It is only lately that we have begun
to find out where birds sleep, because
it is dark when they go to bed, and they
get up before it is light enough for us
to see them.</p>

<p>The only way to catch them in bed
is to go out in the evening, and start
them up after they have gone to sleep.
And this is not very kind to the poor
little birds. Some men who are trying
to learn about the habits of birds have
tried this way, and so have found out
some of their sleeping-places.</p>

<p>One thing they have learned is that
the nest is not often used for a bed,
except for the mother while she is sitting
and keeping her little ones warm.</p>

<p>Robins and orioles, and others, creep
into the thick branches of an evergreen
tree, close up to the trunk. Some crawl
under the edge of a haystack, others
into thick vines or thorny bushes. All
these are meant for hiding-places, so
that beasts that prowl about at night,
and like to eat birds, will not find them.</p>

<p>Tree sparrows like to sleep in holes
in the ground like little caves. The
men who found these cosy little bedrooms
think they are places dug out by
field mice, and other small animals, for
their own use. And when they are left,
the birds are glad to take them.</p>

<p>When the weather is cold, some birds
sleep under the snow. You may think
that would not be very warm, and it is
not so warm as a bed in the house with
plenty of blankets. But it is much
warmer than a perch in a tree, with
nothing but leaves to keep off the
wind.</p>

<p>While the snow is falling, some birds
find it as good as blankets for their
use. Grouse, who live on the ground,
dive into a snow-bank and snuggle down
quietly, while the snow falls and covers
them all over and keeps the cold wind
off. Air comes through the snow, so
they do not smother.</p>

<p>Some birds creep into a pile of brush
that is covered with snow, and find
under the twigs little places like tents,
where the snow has been kept out by
the twigs, and they sleep there, away
from the wind and storm outside.</p>

<p>Water birds find the best sleeping-places
on the water, where they float
all night like tiny boats. Some of them
leave one foot hanging down and paddling
a little, while they sleep, to keep from
being washed to the shore.</p>

<p>Bob-white and his family sleep in a
close circle on the ground, all with their
heads turned outward, so that they can
see or hear an enemy, whichever way
he comes.</p>

<p>Hawks and eagles are said to sleep
standing, never sitting on the feet like
a canary. Some ducks and geese do
even more: they sleep standing on one
foot. Woodpeckers and chimney swifts
hang themselves up by their claws, using<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
their stiff tail for a brace, as if it were a
third leg.</p>

<p>Some birds, like the crows, sleep in
great flocks. They agree upon a piece
of woods, and all the crows for miles
around come there every night. Sometimes
thousands of them sleep in this
one bedroom, called a crow roost.
Robins do the same, after the young
are big enough to fly so far.</p>

<p>Audubon, who has told us so much
about birds, once found a hollow tree
which was the sleeping-room of chimney
swifts. The noise they made going out
in the morning was like the roar of a
great mill-wheel.</p>

<p>He wanted to see the birds asleep.
So in the daytime, when they were
away, he had a piece cut out at the foot
of the tree, big enough to let him in,
and then put back, so the birds would
not notice anything unusual.</p>

<p>At night, after the swifts were abed,
he took a dark lantern and went in.
He turned the light upon them little by
little, so as not to startle them. Then
he saw the whole inside of the tree full
of birds. They were hanging by their
claws, side by side, as thick as they
could hang. He thought there were as
many as twelve thousand in that one
bedroom.</p>


<div class='center'><br />II. HIS TRAVELS</div>

<p>Most of our birds take two long
journeys every year, one in the fall to
the south, and the other in the spring
back to the north. These journeys are
called "migrations."</p>

<p>The birds do not go all at once, but in
many cases those of a kind who live
near each other collect in a flock and
travel together. Each species or kind
has its own time to go.</p>

<p>It might be thought that it is because
of the cold that so many birds move to
a warmer climate. But it is not so;
they are very well dressed to endure
cold. Their feather suits are so warm
that some of our smallest and weakest
birds are able to stay with us, like the
chickadee and the golden-crowned kinglet.
It is simply because they cannot
get food in winter, that they have
to go.</p>

<p>The fall travel begins soon after the
first of July. The bobolink is one of
the first to leave us, though he does not
start at once on his long journey. By
that time his little folk are full grown,
and can take care of themselves, and he
is getting on his winter suit, or moulting.</p>

<p>Then some morning all the bobolinks
in the country are turned out of their
homes in the meadows, by men and
horses and mowing machines, for at
that time the long grass is ready to cut.</p>

<p>Then he begins to think about the
wild rice that is getting just right to
eat. Besides, he likes to take his long
journey to South America in an easy
way, stopping here and there as he
goes. So some morning we miss his
cheerful call, and if we go to the meadow
we shall not be able to see a single
bobolink.</p>

<p>There, too, are the swallows, who eat
only small flying insects. As the weather
grows cooler, these tiny flies are no
longer to be found. So the swallows
begin to flock, as it is called. For a
few days they will be seen on fences and
telegraph wires, chattering and making
a great noise, and then some morning
they will all be gone.</p>

<p>They spend some time in marshes and
lonely places before they at last set
out for the south.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span></p>

<p>As the days grow shorter and cooler,
the warblers go. These are the bright-colored
little fellows, who live mostly
in the tops of trees. Then the orioles
and the thrushes and the cuckoos leave
us, and most birds who live on insects.</p>

<p>By the time that November comes
in, few of them will be left. Birds who
can live on seeds and winter berries,
such as cedar-berries and partridge-berries,
and others, often stay with
us,&mdash;bluebirds, finches, and sometimes
robins.</p>

<p>Many birds take their journey by
night. Think of it! Tiny creatures,
that all summer go to bed at dark, start
off some night, when it seems as if they
ought to be asleep, and fly all night in
the dark.</p>

<p>When it grows light, they stop in
some place where they can feed and rest.
And the next night, or two or three
nights later, they go on again. So they
do until they reach their winter home,
hundreds or thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>These night flyers are the timid birds,
and those who live in the woods and do
not like to be seen,&mdash;thrushes, wrens,
vireos, and others. Birds with strong
wings, who are used to flying hours
every day, and bolder birds, who do
not mind being seen, take their journey
by daylight.</p>

<p>Most of them stop now and then, a
day or two at a time, to feed and rest.
They fly very high, and faster than our
railroad trains can go.</p>

<p>In the spring the birds take their
second long journey, back to their last
year's home.</p>

<p>How they knew their way on these
journeys, men have been for many years
trying to find out. They have found
that birds travel on regular roads, or
routes, that follow the rivers and the
shore of the ocean. They can see much
better than we can, and even in the
night they can see water.</p>

<p>One such road, or highway, is over
the harbor of New York. When the
statue of Liberty was set up on an island
in the harbor a few years ago, it was
put in the birds' path.</p>

<p>Usually they fly too high to mind
it; but when there is a rain or fog they
come much lower, and, sad to say, many
of them fly against it and are killed.</p>

<h4><br />THE POACHER AND THE
SILVER FOX</h4>

<div class='center'>ERNEST THOMPSON SETON</div>

<p>How is it that all mankind has a
sneaking sympathy with a poacher? A
burglar or a pickpocket has our unmitigated
contempt; he clearly is a criminal;
but you will notice that the poacher in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
the story is generally a reckless daredevil
with a large and compensatory
amount of good-fellow in his make-up&mdash;yes,
I almost said, of good citizenship.
I suppose, because in addition to the
breezy, romantic character of his calling,
seasoned with physical danger as well
as moral risk, there is away down in
human nature a strong feeling that, in
spite of man-made laws, the ancient
ruling holds that "wild game belongs
to no man till some one makes it his
property by capture." It may be wrong,
it may be right, but I have heard this
doctrine voiced by red men and white,
as primitive law, once or twice; and have
seen it lived up to a thousand times.</p>

<p>Well, Josh Cree was a poacher. This
does not mean that every night in every
month he went forth with nefarious tricks
and tools, to steal the flesh and fur that
legally were not his. Far from it. Josh
never poached but once. But that's
enough; he had crossed the line, and
this is how it came about:</p>

<p>As you roll up the Yellowstone from
Livingston to Gardiner you may note
a little ranch-house on the west of the
track with its log stables, its corral, its
irrigation ditch, and its alfalfa patch of
morbid green. It is a small affair, for
it was founded by the handiwork of one
honest man, who with his wife and small
boy left Pennsylvania, braved every
danger of the plains, and secured this
claim in the late '80's. Old man Cree&mdash;he
was only forty, but every married
man is "Old Man" in the West&mdash;was
ready to work at any honest calling
from logging or sluicing to grading and
muling. He was strong and steady, his
wife was steady and strong. They saved
their money, and little by little they got
the small ranch-house built and equipped;
little by little they added to their stock
on the range with the cattle of a neighbour,
until there came the happy day
when they went to live on their own
ranch&mdash;father, mother, and fourteen-year-old
Josh, with every prospect of
making it pay. The spreading of that
white tablecloth for the first time was
a real religious ceremony, and the hard
workers gave thanks to the All-father
for His blessing on their every effort.</p>

<p>One year afterward a new event
brought joy: there entered happily
into their happy house a little girl, and
all the prairie smiled about them.
Surely their boat was well beyond the
breakers.</p>

<p>But right in the sunshine of their
joy the trouble cloud arose to block
the sky. Old man Cree was missing
one day. His son rode long and far
on the range for two hard days before
he sighted a grazing pony, and down a
rocky hollow near, found his father,
battered and weak, near death, with a
broken leg and a gash in his head.</p>

<p>He could only gasp "Water" as Josh
hurried up, and the boy rushed off to
fill his hat at the nearest stream.</p>

<p>They had no talk, for the father
swooned after drinking, and Josh had
to face the situation; but he was Western
trained. He stripped himself of all
spare clothing, and his father's horse
of its saddle blanket; then, straightening
out the sick man, he wrapped him in
the clothes and blanket, and rode like
mad for the nearest ranch-house. The
neighbour, a young man, came at once,
with a pot to make tea, an axe, and a
rope. They found the older Cree conscious
but despairing. A fire was made,
and hot tea revived him. Then Josh
cut two long poles from the nearest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
timber and made a stretcher, or travois,
Indian fashion, the upper ends fast to
the saddle of a horse, while the other
ends trailed on the ground. Thus by
a long, slow journey the wounded man
got back. All he had prayed for was
to get home. Every invalid is sure that
if only he can get home all will soon be
well. Mother was not yet strong, the
baby needed much care, but Josh was
a good boy, and the loving best of all
was done for the sick one. His leg, set
by the army surgeon of Fort Yellowstone,
was knit again after a month, but had
no power. He had no force; the shock
of those two dire days was on him. The
second month went by, and still he
lay in bed. Poor Josh was the man of
the place now, and between duties,
indoors and out, he was worn body
and soul.</p>

<p>Then it was clear they must have
help. So Jack S&mdash;&mdash; was engaged at
the regular wages of $40 a month for
outside work, and a year of struggle
went by, only to see John Cree in his
grave, his cattle nearly all gone, his
widow and boy living in a house on which
was still $500 of the original mortgage.
Josh was a brave boy and growing
strong, but unboyishly grave with the
weight of care. He sold off the few
cattle that were left, and set about
keeping the roof over his mother and
baby sister by working a truck farm
for the market supplied by the summer
hotels of the Park, and managed to come
out even. He would in time have done
well, but he could not get far enough
ahead to meet that 10 per cent mortgage
already overdue.</p>

<p>The banker was not a hard man, but
he was in the business for the business.
He extended the time, and waited for
interest again and again, but it only
made the principal larger, and it seemed
that the last ditch was reached, that it
would be best to let the money-man
foreclose, though that must mean a
wipe-out and would leave the fatherless
family homeless.</p>

<p>Winter was coming on, work was
scarce, and Josh went to Gardiner to
see what he could get in the way of
house or wage. He learned of a chance
to 'substitute' for the Park mail-carrier,
who had sprained his foot. It was an
easy drive to Fort Yellowstone, and
there he readily agreed, when they asked
him, to take the letters and packages
and go on farther to the Canyon Hotel.
Thus it was that on the 20th day of
November 189-, Josh Cree, sixteen years
old, tall and ruddy, rode through the
snow to the kitchen door of the Canyon
Hotel and was welcomed as though he
were old Santa Claus himself.</p>

<p>Two Magpies on a tree were among
the onlookers. The Park Bears were
denned up, but there were other fur-bearers
about. High on the wood-pile
sat a Yellow Red Fox in a magnificent
coat. Another was in front of the house,
and the keeper said that as many as a
dozen came some days. And sometimes,
he said, there also came a wonderful
Silver Fox, a size bigger than the rest,
black as coal, with eyes like yellow diamonds,
and a silver frosting like little
stars on his midnight fur.</p>

<p>"My! but he's a beauty. That skin
would buy the best team of mules on
the Yellowstone." That was interesting
and furnished talk for a while. In
the morning when they were rising for
their candlelight breakfast, the hotel
man glancing from the window exclaimed,
"Here he is now!" and Josh peered forth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
to see in the light of sunrise something
he had often heard of, but never before
seen, a coal-black Fox, a giant among
his kind. How slick and elegant his
glossy fur, how slim his legs, and what a
monstrous bushy tail; and the other
Foxes moved aside as the patrician rushed
in impatient haste to seize the food
thrown out by the cook.</p>

<p>"Ain't he a beauty?" said the hotel
man. "I'll bet that pelt would fetch
five hundred."</p>

<p>Oh, why did he say "five hundred,"
the exact sum, for then it was that the
tempter entered into Josh Cree's heart.
Five hundred dollars! just the amount
of the mortgage. "Who owns wild
beasts? The man that kills them,"
said the tempter, and the thought was
a live one in his breast as Josh rode back
to Fort Yellowstone.</p>

<p>At Gardiner he received his pay, $6.00,
for three days' work and, turning it into
groceries, set out for the poor home that
soon would be lost to him, and as he
rode he did some hard and gloomy
thinking. On his wrist there hung a
wonderful Indian quirt of plaited rawhide
and horsehair with beads on the
shaft, and a band of Elk teeth on the
butt. It was a pet of his, and "good
medicine," for a flat piece of elkhorn
let in the middle was perforated with a
hole, through which the distant landscape
was seen much clearer&mdash;a well-known
law, an ancient trick, but it made
the quirt prized as a thing of rare virtue,
and Josh had refused good offers for it.
Then a figure afoot was seen, and coming
nearer, it turned out to be a friend, Jack
Day, out a-gunning with a .22 rifle.
But game was scarce and Jack was
returning to Gardiner empty-handed
and disgusted. They stopped for a
moment's greeting when Day said:
"Huntin's played out now. How'll you
swap that quirt for my rifle?" A
month before Josh would have scorned
the offer. A ten-dollar quirt for a five-dollar
rifle, but now he said briefly:
"For rifle with cover, tools and ammunition
complete, I'll go ye." So the
deal was made and in an hour Josh was
home. He stabled Grizzle, the last of
their saddle stock, and entered.</p>

<p>Love and sorrow dwelt in the widow's
home, but the return of Josh brought
its measure of joy. Mother prepared
the regular meal of tea, potatoes, and
salt pork; there was a time when they
had soared as high as canned goods, but
those prosperous days were gone. Josh
was dandling baby sister on his lap as
he told of his trip, and he learned of
two things of interest: First, the bank
must have its money by February;
second, the stable at Gardiner wanted
a driver for the Cook City stage. Then
the little events moved quickly. His
half-formed plan of getting back to the
Canyon was now frustrated by the new
opening, and, besides this, hope had
been dampened by the casual word of
one who reported that "that Silver Fox
had not been seen since at the Canyon."</p>

<p>Then began long days of dreary driving
through the snow, with a noon halt
at Yancey's and then three days later
the return, in the cold, the biting cold.
It was freezing work, but coldest of all
was the chill thought at his heart that
February 1st would see him homeless.</p>

<p>Small bands of Mountain Sheep he
saw at times on the slope of Evarts, and
a few Blacktail, and later, when the
winter deepened, huge bull Elk were
seen along the trail. Sometimes they
moved not more than a few paces to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
let him pass. These were everyday
things to him, but in the second week
of his winter work he got a sudden thrill.
He was coming down the long hill back
of Yancey's when what should he see
there, sitting on its tail, shiny black with
yellow eyes like a huge black cat unusually
long and sharp in the nose, but a
wonderful Silver Fox! Possibly the same
as the one he saw at the Canyon, for
that one he knew had disappeared and
there were not likely to be two in the
Park. Yes, it might be the same, and
Josh's bosom surged with mingled feelings.
Why did he not carry that little
gun? Why did he not realize? were
the thoughts that came&mdash;$500! A noble
chance! broad daylight only twenty-five
yards! and gone!</p>

<p>The Fox was still there when Josh
drove on. On the next trip he brought
the little rifle. He had sawed off the
stock so he could hide it easily in his
overcoat if need be. No man knew
that he carried arms, but the Foxes
seemed to know. The Red ones kept
afar and the Black one came no more.
Day after day he drove and hoped but
the Black Fox has cunning measured to
his value. He came not, or if he came,
was wisely hidden, and so the month
went by, till late in the cold Moon of
Snow he heard old Yancey say, "There's
a Silver Fox bin a-hanging around the
stable this last week. Leastwise Dave
says he seen him." There were soldiers
sitting around that stove, game guardians
of the Park, and still more dangerous, a
scout, the soldiers' guide, a mountaineer.
Josh turned not an inch, he made no
sound in response, but his heart gave a
jump. Half an hour later he went out
to bed his horses for the night, and
peering around the stable he saw a
couple of shadowy forms that silently
shifted until swallowed by the gloom.</p>

<p>Then the soldiers came to bed their
horses, and Josh went back to the stove.
His big driving coat hung with the little
sawed-off rifle in the long pocket. He
waited till the soldiers one by one went
up the ladder to the general bunk-room.
He rose again, got the lantern, lighted
it, carried it out behind the lonely stable.
The horses were grinding their hay, the
stars were faintly lighting the snow.
There was no one about as he hung the
lantern under the eaves outside so that
it could be seen from the open valley,
but not from the house.</p>

<p>A faint Yap-yah of a Fox was heard
on the piney hillside, as he lay down on
the hay in the loft, but there were no
signs of life on the snow. He had come
to wait all night if need be, and waited.
The lantern might allure, it might scare,
but it was needed in this gloom, and it
tinged the snow with faint yellow light
below him. An hour went by, then a
big-tailed form came near and made a
little bark at the lantern. It looked
very dark, but it had a paler patch on
the throat. This waiting was freezing
work; Josh's teeth were chattering in
spite of his overcoat. Another gray
form came, then a much larger black
one shaped itself on the white. It
dashed at the first, which fled, and the
second one followed but a little and then
sat down on the snow, gazing at that
bright light. When you are sure, you
are so sure&mdash;Josh knew him now, he
was facing the Silver Fox. But the
light was dim. Josh's hand trembled
as he bared it to lay the back on his lips
and suck so as to make a mousey squeak.
The effect on the Fox was instant. He
glided forward intent as a hunting cat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
Again he stood in, oh! such a wonderful
pose, still as a statue, frozen like a hiding
Partridge, unbudging as a lone kid
Antelope in May. And Josh raised&mdash;yes,
he had come for that&mdash;he raised
that fatal gun. The lantern blazed in
the Fox's face at twenty yards; the
light was flung back doubled by its
shining eyes; it looked perfectly clear.
Josh lined the gun, but, strange to tell,
the sights so plain were lost at once, and
the gun was shaking like a sorghum
stalk while the Gopher gnaws its root.
He laid the weapon down with a groan,
cursed his own poor trembling hand,
and in an instant the wonder Fox was
gone.</p>

<p>Poor Josh! He wasn't bad-tongued,
but now he used all the evil words he
had ever heard, and he was Western
bred. Then he reacted on himself.
"The Fox might come back!" Suddenly
he remembered something. He got out
a common sulphur match. He wet it
on his lips and rubbed it on the muzzle
sight: Then on each side of the notch
on the breech sight. He lined it for a
tree. Yes! surely! What had been a
blur of blackness had now a visible
form.</p>

<p>A faint bark on a far hillside might
mean a coming or a going Fox. Josh
waited five minutes, then again he
squeaked on his bare hand. The effect
was a surprise when from the shelter
of the stable wall ten feet below there
leaped the great dark Fox. At fifteen
feet it paused. Those yellow orbs were
fiery in the light and the rifle sights with
the specks of fire were lined. There
was a sharp report and the black-robed
fur was still and limp in the snow.</p>

<p>Who can tell the crack of a small
rifle among the louder cracks of green
logs splitting with the fierce frost of a
Yellowstone winter's night? Why should
travel-worn travelers wake at each
slight, usual sound? Who knows? Who
cares?</p>

<p>And afar in Livingston what did the
fur dealer care? It was a great prize.
Or the banker? he got his five hundred,
and mother found it easy to accept the
Indians' creed: "Who owns wild beasts?
The man who kills them."</p>

<p>"I did not know how it would come,"
she said; "I only knew it would come,
for I prayed and believed."</p>

<p>We know that it came when it meant
the most. The house was saved. It
was the turn in their fortune's tide, and
the crucial moment of the change was
when those three bright sulphur spots
were lined with the living lamps in the
head of the Silver Fox. Yes! Josh was
a poacher. Just once.</p>

<h4><br />THE STORY OF A SALMON</h4>

<div class='center'>DAVID STARR JORDAN</div>

<p>In the realm of the Northwest Wind,
on the boundary-line between the dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
fir-forests and the sunny plains, there
stands a mountain,&mdash;a great white cone
two miles and a half in perpendicular
height. On its lower mile the dense fir-woods
cover it with never-changing
green; on its next half-mile a lighter
green of grass and bushes gives place in
winter to white; and on its uppermost
mile the snows of the great ice age
still linger in unspotted purity. The
people of Washington Territory say that
their mountain is the great "King-pin
of the Universe," which shows that even
in its own country Mount Tacoma is not
without honor.</p>

<p>Flowing down from the southwest
slope of Mount Tacoma is a cold, clear
river, fed by the melting snows of the
mountain. Madly it hastens down over
white cascades and beds of shining sands,
through birch-woods and belts of dark
firs, to mingle its waters at last with
those of the great Columbia. This river
is the Cowlitz; and on its bottom, not
many years ago, there lay half buried
in the sand a number of little orange-colored
globules, each about as large as
a pea. These were not much in themselves,
but great in their possibilities.
In the waters above them little suckers
and chubs and prickly sculpins strained
their mouths to draw these globules from
the sand, and vicious-looking crawfishes
picked them up with their blundering
hands and examined them with their telescopic
eyes. But one, at least, of the
globules escaped their curiosity, else this
story would not be worth telling. The
sun shone down on it through the clear
water, and the ripples of the Cowlitz
said over it their incantations, and in it
at last awoke a living being. It was a
fish,&mdash;a curious little fellow, not half an
inch long, with great, staring eyes, which
made almost half his length, and with a
body so transparent that he could not
cast a shadow. He was a little salmon,
a very little salmon; but the water was
good, and there were flies and worms
and little living creatures in abundance
for him to eat, and he soon became a
larger salmon. Then there were many
more little salmon with him, some larger
and some smaller, and they all had a
merry time. Those who had been born
soonest and had grown largest used to
chase the others around and bite off
their tails, or, still better, take them by
the heads and swallow them whole; for,
said they, "Even young salmon are good
eating." "Heads I win, tails you lose,"
was their motto. Thus, what was once
two small salmon became united into a
single larger one, and the process of "addition,
division, and silence" still went
on. By-and-by, when all the salmon
were too large to be swallowed, they
began to grow restless. They saw that
the water rushing by seemed to be in a
great hurry to get somewhere, and it
was somehow suggested that its hurry
was caused by something good to eat at
the other end of its course. Then they
all started down the stream, salmon-fashion,&mdash;which
fashion is to get into
the current, head up-stream; and thus to
drift backward as the river sweeps along.</p>

<p>Down the Cowlitz River the salmon
went for a day and a night, finding
much to interest them which we need
not know. At last they began to grow
hungry; and coming near the shore,
they saw an angle-worm of rare size
and beauty floating in an eddy of the
stream. Quick as thought one of them
opened his mouth, which was well filled
with teeth of different sizes, and put it
around the angle-worm. Quicker still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
he felt a sharp pain in his gills, followed
by a smothering sensation, and in an
instant his comrades saw him rise straight
into the air. This was nothing new to
them; for they often leaped out of the
water in their games of hide-and-seek,
but only to come down again with a
loud splash not far from where they
went out. But this one never came
back, and the others went on their
course wondering.</p>

<p>At last they came to where the Cowlitz
and the Columbia join, and they were
almost lost for a time; for they could
find no shores, and the bottom and the
top of the water were so far apart.
Here they saw other and far larger
salmon in the deepest part of the current,
turning neither to the right nor to the
left, but swimming right on up-stream,
just as rapidly as they could. And these
great salmon would not stop for them,
and would not lie and float with the
current. They had no time to talk,
even in the simple sign language by
which fishes express their ideas, and no
time to eat. They had important work
before them, and the time was short.
So they went on up the river, keeping
their great purposes to themselves; and
our little salmon and his friends from
the Cowlitz drifted down the stream.</p>

<p>By-and-by the water began to change.
It grew denser, and no longer flowed
rapidly along; and twice a day it used
to turn about and flow the other way.
Then the shores disappeared, and the
water began to have a different and
peculiar flavor,&mdash;a flavor which seemed
to the salmon much richer and more
inspiring than the glacier-water of their
native Cowlitz. There were many curious
things to see,&mdash;crabs with hard
shells and savage faces, but so good
when crushed and swallowed! Then
there were luscious squid swimming
about; and, to a salmon, squid are like
ripe peaches and cream. There were
great companies of delicate sardines and
herring, green and silvery, and it was
such fun to chase and capture them!
Those who eat sardines packed in oil
by greasy fingers, and herrings dried in
the smoke, can have little idea how
satisfying it is to have a meal of them,
plump and sleek and silvery, fresh from
the sea.</p>

<p>Thus the salmon chased the herrings
about, and had a merry time. Then
they were chased about in turn by great
sea-lions,&mdash;swimming monsters with
huge half-human faces, long thin whiskers,
and blundering ways. The sea-lions
liked to bite out the throat of a salmon,
with its precious stomach full of luscious
sardines, and then to leave the rest of
the fish to shift for itself. And the seals
and the herrings scattered the salmon
about, till at last the hero of our story
found himself quite alone, with none of
his own kind near him. But that did
not trouble him much, and he went on
his own way, getting his dinner when
he was hungry, which was all the time,
and then eating a little between meals
for his stomach's sake.</p>

<p>So it went on for three long years;
and at the end of this time our little fish
had grown to be a great, fine salmon of
twenty-two pounds' weight, shining like
a new tin pan, and with rows of the
loveliest round black spots on his head
and back and tail. One day, as he was
swimming about, idly chasing a big
sculpin with head so thorny that he
never was swallowed by anybody, all of
a sudden the salmon noticed a change in
the water around him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span></p>

<p>Spring had come again, and south-lying
snow-drifts on the Cascade Mountains
once more felt that the "earth was
wheeling sunwards." The cold snow
waters ran down from the mountains
and into the Columbia River, and made
a freshet on the river. The high water
went far out into the sea, and out in the
sea our salmon felt it on his gills. He
remembered how the cold water used to
feel in the Cowlitz when he was a little
fish. In a blundering, fishy fashion he
thought about it; he wondered whether
the little eddy looked as it used to look,
and whether caddis-worms and young
mosquitoes were really as sweet and
tender as he used to think they were.
Then he thought some other things; but
as the salmon's mind is located in the
optic lobes of his brain, and ours is in a
different place, we cannot be quite certain
what his thoughts really were.</p>

<p>What our salmon did, we know. He
did what every grown salmon in the
ocean does when he feels the glacier-water
once more upon his gills. He
became a changed being. He spurned
the blandishment of soft-shelled crabs.
The pleasures of the table and of the
chase, heretofore his only delights, lost
their charms for him. He turned his
course straight toward the direction
whence the cold water came, and for
the rest of his life never tasted a mouthful
of food. He moved on toward the river-mouth,
at first playfully, as though he
were not really certain whether he
meant anything after all. Afterward,
when he struck the full current of the
Columbia, he plunged straight forward
with an unflinching determination that
had in it something of the heroic. When
he had passed the rough water at the bar,
he was not alone. His old neighbors of
the Cowlitz, and many more from the
Clackamas and the Spokane and Des
Ch&ucirc;tes and Kootenay,&mdash;a great army of
salmon,&mdash;were with him. In front
were thousands pressing on, and behind
them were thousands more, all moved
by a common impulse which urged them
up the Columbia.</p>

<p>They were all swimming bravely along
where the current was deepest, when
suddenly the foremost felt something
tickling like a cobweb about their noses
and under their chins. They changed
their course a little to brush it off, and
it touched their fins as well. Then they
tried to slip down with the current, and
thus leave it behind. But, no! the thing,
whatever it was, although its touch was
soft, refused to let go, and held them like
a fetter. The more they struggled, the
tighter became its grasp, and the whole
foremost rank of the salmon felt it
together; for it was a great gill-net, a
quarter of a mile long, stretched squarely
across the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>By-and-by men came in boats, and
hauled up the gill-net and the helpless
salmon that had become entangled in it.
They threw the fishes into a pile in the
bottom of the boat, and the others saw
them no more. We that live outside
the water know better what befalls them,
and we can tell the story which the
salmon could not.</p>

<p>All along the banks of the Columbia
River, from its mouth to nearly thirty
miles away, there is a succession of large
buildings, looking like great barns or
warehouses, built on piles in the river,
high enough to be out of the reach of
floods. There are thirty of these buildings,
and they are called canneries.
Each cannery has about forty boats,
and with each boat are two men and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
long gill-net. These nets fill the whole
river as with a nest of cobwebs from
April to July, and to each cannery nearly
a thousand great salmon are brought
every day. These salmon are thrown in
a pile on the floor; and Wing Hop, the
big Chinaman, takes them one after
another on the table, and with a great
knife dexterously cuts off the head, the
tail, and the fins; then with a sudden
thrust he removes the intestines and the
eggs. The body goes into a tank of
water; and the head is dropped into a
box on a flat-boat, and goes down the
river to be made into salmon oil. Next,
the body is brought to another table;
and Quong Sang, with a machine like
a feed-cutter, cuts it into pieces each
just as long as a one-pound can. Then
Ah Sam, with a butcher-knife, cuts
these pieces into strips just as wide as
the can. Next Wan Lee, the "China
boy," brings down a hundred cans from
the loft where the tinners are making
them, and into each puts a spoonful of
salt. It takes just six salmon to fill a
hundred cans. Then twenty Chinamen
put the pieces of meat into the cans, fitting
in little strips to make them exactly
full. Ten more solder up the cans, and
ten more put the cans into boiling water
till the meat is thoroughly cooked, and
five more punch a little hole in the
head of each can to let out the air. Then
they solder them up again, and little
girls paste on them bright-colored labels
showing merry little cupids riding the
happy salmon up to the cannery door,
with Mount Tacoma and Cape Disappointment
in the background; and a
legend underneath says that this is
"Booth's," or "Badollet's Best," or
"Hume's," or "Clark's," or "Kinney's
Superfine Salt Water Salmon." Then
the cans are placed in cases, forty-eight
in a case, and five hundred thousand
cases are put up every year. Great
ships come to Astoria, and are loaded
with them; and they carry them away
to London and San Francisco and Liverpool
and New York and Sidney and
Valparaiso; and the man at the corner
grocery sells them at twenty cents a
can.</p>

<p>All this time our salmon is going up
the river, eluding one net as by a miracle,
and soon having need of more miracles
to escape the rest; passing by Astoria
on a fortunate day,&mdash;which was Sunday,
the day on which no man may fish if he
expects to sell what he catches,&mdash;till
finally he came to where nets were few,
and, at last, to where they ceased altogether.
But there he found that scarcely
any of his many companies were with
him; for the nets cease when there are
no more salmon to be caught in them.
So he went on, day and night, where the
water was deepest, stopping not to feed
or loiter on the way, till at last he came
to a wild gorge, where the great river
became an angry torrent, rushing wildly
over a huge staircase of rocks. But
our hero did not falter; and summoning
all his forces, he plunged into the Cascades.
The current caught him and
dashed him against the rocks. A whole
row of silvery scales came off and glistened
in the water like sparks of fire, and
a place on his side became black-and-red,
which, for a salmon, is the same as
being black-and-blue for other people.
His comrades tried to go up with him;
and one lost his eye, one his tail, and one
had his lower jaw pushed back into his
head like the joint of a telescope. Again
he tried to surmount the Cascades; and
at last he succeeded, and an Indian on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
the rocks above was waiting to receive
him. But the Indian with his spear was
less skillful than he was wont to be, and
our hero escaped, losing only a part of
one of his fins; and with him came one
other, and henceforth these two pursued
their journey together.</p>

<p>Now a gradual change took place in
the looks of our salmon. In the sea he
was plump and round and silvery, with
delicate teeth in a symmetrical mouth.
Now his silvery color disappeared, his
skin grew slimy, and the scales sank
into it; his back grew black, and his
sides turned red,&mdash;not a healthy red,
but a sort of hectic flush. He grew
poor, and his back, formerly as straight
as need be, now developed an unpleasant
hump at the shoulders. His eyes&mdash;like
those of all enthusiasts who forsake eating
and sleeping for some loftier aim&mdash;became
dark and sunken. His symmetrical
jaws grew longer and longer, and
meeting each other, as the nose of an
old man meets his chin, each had to
turn aside to let the other pass. His
beautiful teeth grew longer and longer,
and projected from his mouth, giving
him a savage and wolfish appearance,
quite at variance with his real disposition.
For all the desires and ambitions
of his nature had become centered into
one. We may not know what this one
was, but we know that it was a strong
one; for it had led him on and on,&mdash;past
the nets and horrors of Astoria;
past the dangerous Cascades; past the
spears of Indians; through the terrible
flume of the Dalles, where the mighty
river is compressed between huge rocks
into a channel narrower than a village
street; on past the meadows of Umatilla
and the wheat-fields of Walla Walla; on
to where the great Snake River and the
Columbia join; on up the Snake River
and its eastern branch, till at last he
reached the foot of the Bitter Root
mountains in the Territory of Idaho,
nearly a thousand miles from the ocean
which he had left in April. With him
still was the other salmon which had
come with him through the Cascades,
handsomer and smaller than he, and,
like him, growing poor and ragged and
tired.</p>

<p>At last, one October afternoon, our
finny travelers came together to a little
clear brook, with a bottom of fine gravel,
over which the water was but a few
inches deep. Our fish painfully worked
his way to it; for his tail was all frayed
out, his muscles were sore, and his skin
covered with unsightly blotches. But
his sunken eyes saw a ripple in the stream,
and under it a bed of little pebbles and
sand. So there in the sand he scooped
out with his tail a smooth round place,
and his companion came and filled it
with orange-colored eggs. Then our
salmon came back again; and softly
covering the eggs, the work of their lives
was done, and, in the old salmon fashion,
they drifted tail foremost down the
stream.</p>

<p>They drifted on together for a night
and a day, but they never came to the
sea. For the salmon has but one life
to live, and it ascends the river but once.
The rest lies with its children. And
when the April sunshine fell on the globules
in the gravel, these were wakened
into life. With the early autumn rains,
the little fishes were large enough to
begin their wanderings. They dropped
down the current in the old salmon
fashion. And thus they came into the
great river and drifted away to the
sea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>.</p>

<h4><br />MOTI GUJ&mdash;MUTINEER</h4>

<div class='center'>RUDYARD KIPLING</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a coffee-planter
in India who wished to clear some
forest land for coffee-planting. When
he had cut down all the trees and burned
the underwood, the stumps still remained.
Dynamite is expensive and slow fire
slow. The happy medium for stump-clearing
is the lord of all beasts, who is
the elephant. He will either push the
stump out of the ground with his tusks,
if he has any, or drag it out with ropes.
The planter, therefore, hired elephants
by ones and twos and threes, and fell
to work. The very best of all the elephants
belonged to the very worst of
all the drivers or mahouts; and this
superior beast's name was Moti Guj.
He was the absolute property of his
mahout, which would never have been
the case under native rule: for Moti
Guj was a creature to be desired by kings,
and his name, being translated, meant
the Pearl Elephant. Because the British
government was in the land, Deesa, the
mahout, enjoyed his property undisturbed.
He was dissipated. When he
had made much money through the
strength of his elephant, he would get
extremely drunk and give Moti Guj a
beating with a tent-peg over the tender
nails of the forefeet. Moti Guj never
trampled the life out of Deesa on these
occasions, for he knew that after the
beating was over, Deesa would embrace
his trunk and weep and call him his love
and his life and the liver of his soul, and
give him some liquor. Moti Guj was
very fond of liquor&mdash;arrack for choice,
though he would drink palm-tree toddy
if nothing better offered. Then Deesa
would go to sleep between Moti Guj's
forefeet, and as Deesa generally chose
the middle of the public road, and as
Moti Guj mounted guard over him, and
would not permit horse, foot, or cart to
pass by, traffic was congested till Deesa
saw fit to wake up.</p>

<p>There was no sleeping in the daytime
on the planter's clearing: the wages
were too high to risk. Deesa sat on
Moti Guj's neck and gave him orders,
while Moti Guj rooted up the stumps&mdash;for
he owned a magnificent pair of tusks;
or pulled at the end of a rope&mdash;for he
had a magnificent pair of shoulders&mdash;while
Deesa kicked him behind the ears
and said he was the king of elephants.
At evening time Moti Guj would wash
down his three hundred pounds' weight
of green food with a quart of arrack,
and Deesa would take a share, and
sing songs between Moti Guj's legs till
it was time to go to bed. Once a week
Deesa led Moti Guj down to the river,
and Moti Guj lay on his side luxuriously
in the shallows, while Deesa went over
him with a coir-swab and a brick. Moti
Guj never mistook the pounding blow
of the latter for the smack of the former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
that warned him to get up and turn
over on the other side. Then Deesa
would look at his feet and examine his
eyes, and turn up the fringes of his
mighty ears in case of sores or budding
ophthalmia. After inspection the two
would "come up with a song from the
sea," Moti Guj, all black and shining,
waving a torn tree branch twelve feet
long in his trunk, and Deesa knotting
up his own long wet hair.</p>

<p>It was a peaceful, well-paid life till
Deesa felt the return of the desire to
drink deep. He wished for an orgy.
The little draughts that led nowhere were
taking the manhood out of him.</p>

<p>He went to the planter, and "My
mother's dead," he said, weeping.</p>

<p>"She died on the last plantation two
months ago, and she died once before
that when you were working for me
last year," said the planter, who knew
something of the ways of nativedom.</p>

<p>"Then it's my aunt, and she was just
the same as a mother to me," said Deesa,
weeping more than ever. "She has left
eighteen small children entirely without
bread, and it is I who must fill their
little stomachs," said Deesa, beating
his head on the floor.</p>

<p>"Who brought you the news?" said
the planter.</p>

<p>"The post," said Deesa.</p>

<p>"There hasn't been a post here for the
past week. Get back to your lines!"</p>

<p>"A devastating sickness has fallen on
my village, and all my wives are dying,"
yelled Deesa, really in tears this time.</p>

<p>"Call Chihun, who comes from Deesa's
village," said the planter. "Chihun, has
this man got a wife?"</p>

<p>"He?" said Chihun. "No. Not a
woman of our village would look at him.
They'd sooner marry the elephant."</p>

<p>Chihun snorted. Deesa wept and
bellowed.</p>

<p>"You will get into a difficulty in a
minute," said the planter. "Go back
to your work!"</p>

<p>"Now I will speak Heaven's truth,"
gulped Deesa, with an inspiration. "I
haven't been drunk for two months.
I desire to depart in order to get properly
drunk afar off and distant from this
heavenly plantation. Thus I shall cause
no trouble."</p>

<p>A flickering smile crossed the planter's
face. "Deesa," said he, "you've spoken
the truth, and I'd give you leave on the
spot if anything could be done with
Moti Guj while you're away. You
know that he will only obey your orders."</p>

<p>"May the light of the heavens live
forty thousand years. I shall be absent
but ten little days. After that, <i>upon</i> my
faith and honor and soul, I return. As
to the inconsiderable interval, have I
the gracious permission of the heaven-born
to call up Moti Guj?"</p>

<p>Permission was granted, and in answer
to Deesa's shrill yell, the mighty tusker
swung out of the shade of a clump
of trees where he had been squirting
dust over himself till his master should
return.</p>

<p>"Light of my heart, protector of
the drunken, mountain of might, give
ear!" said Deesa, standing in front of
him.</p>

<p>Moti Guj gave ear, and saluted with
his trunk. "I am going away!" said
Deesa.</p>

<p>Moti Guj's eyes twinkled. He liked
jaunts as well as his master. One could
snatch all manner of nice things from
the road-side then.</p>

<p>"But you, you fussy old pig, must
stay behind and work."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span></p>

<p>The twinkle died out as Moti Guj
tried to look delighted. He hated stump-hauling
on the plantation. It hurt his
teeth.</p>

<p>"I shall be gone for ten days, oh
delectable one! Hold up your near forefoot
and I'll impress the fact upon it,
warty toad of a dried mud-puddle."
Deesa took a tent-peg and banged Moti
Guj ten times on the nails. Moti Guj
grunted and shuffled from foot to foot.</p>

<p>"Ten days," said Deesa, "you will
work and haul and root the trees as
Chihun here shall order you. Take up
Chihun and set him on your neck!"
Moti Guj curled the tip of his trunk,
Chihun put his foot there, and was
swung on to the neck. Deesa handed
Chihun the heavy <i>ankus</i>&mdash;the iron
elephant goad.</p>

<p>Chihun thumped Moti Guj's bald
head as a paver thumps a curbstone.</p>

<p>Moti Guj trumpeted.</p>

<p>"Be still, hog of the backwoods!
Chihun's your mahout for ten days.
And now bid me good-by, beast after
mine own heart. Oh, my lord, my king!
Jewel of all created elephants, lily of the
herd, preserve your honored health; be
virtuous. Adieu!"</p>

<p>Moti Guj lapped his trunk round Deesa
and swung him into the air twice. That
was his way of bidding him good-by.</p>

<p>"He'll work now," said Deesa to the
planter. "Have I leave to go?"</p>

<p>The planter nodded, and Deesa dived
into the woods. Moti Guj went back
to haul stumps.</p>

<p>Chihun was very kind to him, but he
felt unhappy and forlorn for all that.
Chihun gave him a ball of spices, and
tickled him under the chin, and Chihun's
little baby cooed to him after work was
over, and Chihun's wife called him a
darling; but Moti Guj was a bachelor
by instinct, as Deesa was. He did not
understand the domestic emotions. He
wanted the light of his universe back
again&mdash;the drink and the drunken slumber,
the savage beatings and the savage
caresses.</p>

<p>None the less he worked well, and the
planter wondered. Deesa had wandered
along the roads till he met a marriage
procession of his own caste, and, drinking,
dancing, and tippling, had drifted with
it past all knowledge of the lapse of time.</p>

<p>The morning of the eleventh day
dawned, and there returned no Deesa.
Moti Guj was loosed from his ropes for
the daily stint. He swung clear, looked
round, shrugged his shoulders, and began
to walk away, as one having business
elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Hi! ho! Come back you!" shouted
Chihun. "Come back and put me on
your neck, misborn mountain! Return,
splendor of the hill-sides! Adornment
of all India, heave to, or I'll bang every
toe off your fat forefoot!"</p>

<p>Moti Guj gurgled gently, but did not
obey. Chihun ran after him with a
rope and caught him up. Moti Guj
put his ears forward, and Chihun knew
what that meant, though he tried to
carry it off with high words.</p>

<p>"None of your nonsense with me,"
said he. "To your pickets, devil-son!"</p>

<p>"Hrrump!" said Moti Guj, and that
was all&mdash;that and the forebent ears.</p>

<p>Moti Guj put his hands in his pockets,
chewed a branch for a toothpick, and
strolled about the clearing, making fun
of the other elephants who had just set
to work.</p>

<p>Chihun reported the state of affairs
to the planter, who came out with a dog-whip
and cracked it furiously. Moti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
Guj paid the white man the compliment
of charging him nearly a quarter of a
mile across the clearing and "Hrrumphing"
him into his veranda. Then he
stood outside the house, chuckling to
himself and shaking all over with the
fun of it as an elephant will.</p>

<p>"We'll thrash him," said the planter.
"He shall have the finest thrashing ever
elephant received. Give Kala Nag and
Nazim twelve foot of chain apiece, and
tell them to lay on twenty."</p>

<p>Kala Nag&mdash;which means Black Snake&mdash;and
Nazim were two of the biggest
elephants in the lines, and one of their
duties was to administer the graver
punishment, since no man can beat
an elephant properly.</p>

<p>They took the whipping-chains and
rattled them in their trunks as they
sidled up to Moti Guj, meaning to hustle
him between them. Moti Guj had
never, in all his life of thirty-nine years,
been whipped, and he did not intend to
begin a new experience. So he waited,
waving his head from right to left, and
measuring the precise spot in Kala Nag's
fat side where a blunt tusk could sink
deepest. Kala Nag had no tusks; the
chain was the badge of his authority;
but for all that, he swung wide of Moti
Guj at the last minute, and tried to
appear as if he had brought the chain out
for amusement. Nazim turned round
and went home early. He did not feel
fighting fit that morning and so Moti
Guj was left, standing alone with his
ears cocked.</p>

<p>That decided the planter to argue no
more, and Moti Guj rolled back to his
amateur inspection of the clearing. An
elephant who will not work and is not
tied up is about as manageable as an
eighty-one-ton gun loose in a heavy
seaway. He slapped old friends on the
back and asked them if the stumps were
coming away easily; he talked nonsense
concerning labor and the inalienable
rights of elephants to a long "nooning";
and, wandering to and fro, he thoroughly
demoralized the garden till sundown,
when he returned to his picket for food.</p>

<p>"If you won't work, you shan't eat,"
said Chihun, angrily. "You're a wild
elephant, and no educated animal at
all. Go back to your jungle."</p>

<p>Chihun's little brown baby was rolling
on the floor of the hut, and stretching
out its fat arms to the huge shadow in
the doorway. Moti Guj knew well that
it was the dearest thing on earth to
Chihun. He swung out his trunk with
a fascinating crook at the end, and the
brown baby threw itself, shouting upon
it. Moti Guj made fast and pulled up till
the brown baby was crowing in the air
twelve feet above his father's head.</p>

<p>"Great Lord!" said Chihun. "Flour
cakes of the best, twelve in number, two
feet across and soaked in rum, shall be
yours on the instant, and two hundred
pounds weight of fresh-cut young sugar-cane
therewith. Deign only to put down
safely that insignificant brat who is my
heart and my life to me!"</p>

<p>Moti Guj tucked the brown baby
comfortably between his forefeet, that
could have knocked into toothpicks all
Chihun's hut, and waited for his food.
He ate it, and the brown baby crawled
away. Moti Guj dozed and thought of
Deesa. One of many mysteries connected
with the elephant is that his huge
body needs less sleep than anything else
that lives. Four or five hours in the
night suffice&mdash;two just before midnight,
lying down on one side; two just after
one o'clock, lying down on the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
The rest of the silent hours are filled
with eating and fidgeting, and long
grumbling soliloquies.</p>

<p>At midnight, therefore, Moti Guj
strode out of his pickets, for a thought
had come to him that Deesa might be
lying drunk somewhere in the dark
forest with none to look after him. So
all that night he chased through the
undergrowth, blowing and trumpeting
and shaking his ears. He went down
to the river and blared across the shallows
where Deesa used to wash him,
but there was no answer. He could not
find Deesa, but he disturbed all the other
elephants in the lines, and nearly frightened
to death some gypsies in the woods.</p>

<p>At dawn Deesa returned to the plantation.
He had been very drunk indeed,
and he expected to get into trouble for
outstaying his leave. He drew a long
breath when he saw that the bungalow
and the plantation were still uninjured,
for he knew something of Moti Guj's
temper, and reported himself with many
lies and salaams. Moti Guj had gone
to his pickets for breakfast. The night
exercises had made him hungry.</p>

<p>"Call up your beast," said the planter;
and Deesa shouted in the mysterious
elephant language that some mahouts
believe came from China at the birth
of the world, when elephants and not
men were masters. Moti Guj heard and
came. Elephants do not gallop. They
move from places at varying rates of
speed. If an elephant wished to catch
an express train he could not gallop, but
he could catch the train. So Moti Guj
was at the planter's door almost before
Chihun noticed that he had left his
pickets. He fell into Deesa's arms,
trumpeting with joy, and the man and
beast wept and slobbered over each
other, and handled each other from
head to heel to see that no harm had
befallen.</p>

<p>"Now we will get to work," said Deesa.
"Lift me up, my son and my joy!"</p>

<p>Moti Guj swung him up, and the two
went to the coffee-clearing to look for
difficult stumps.</p>

<p>The planter was too astonished to be
very angry.</p>

<div class="hang1">Among the writers of nature fiction, probably
no one deserves higher rank than Charles
G. D. Roberts (1860&mdash;), a Canadian. Mr.
Roberts does not tell of his own adventures.
His stories are truly nature fiction because
the characters are animals and the purpose
is to reveal the nature of these characters
by showing how they would act when placed
in various imaginary situations. <i>Kings in
Exile</i>, from which the following selection is
taken, is a book of splendid stories of large
animals. Other excellent books by Mr.
Roberts, suitable for the seventh and eighth
grades, are <i>Hoof and Claw</i>, <i>Children of the

<h4><br />LAST BULL</h4>

<div class='center'>CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS</div>

<p>That was what two grim old sachems
of the Dacotahs had dubbed him; and
though his official title, on the lists of
the Zoological Park, was "Kaiser," the
new and more significant name had
promptly supplanted it. The Park
authorities&mdash;people of imagination and
of sentiment, as must all be who would
deal successfully with wild animals&mdash;had
felt at once that the name aptly embodied
the tragedies and the romantic memories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
of his all-but-vanished race. They had
felt, too, that the two old braves who had
been brought East to adorn a city
pageant, and who had stood gazing
stoically for hours at the great bull
buffalo through the barrier of the steel-wire
fence, were fitted, before all others,
to give him a name. Between him and
them there was surely a tragic bond, as
they stood there islanded among the
swelling tides of civilization which had
already engulfed their kindreds. "Last
Bull" they had called him, as he answered
their gaze with little, sullen, melancholy
eyes from under his ponderous and
shaggy front. "Last Bull"&mdash;and the
passing of his race was in the name.</p>

<p>Here, in his fenced, protected range,
with a space of grassy meadow, half a
dozen clumps of sheltering trees, two
hundred yards of the run of a clear,
unfailing brook, and a warm shed for
refuge against the winter storms, the
giant buffalo ruled his little herd of three
tawny cows, two yearlings, and one
blundering, butting calf of the season.
He was a magnificent specimen of his
race&mdash;surpassing, it was said, the finest
bull in the Yellowstone preserves or in
the guarded Canadian herd of the North.
Little short of twelve feet in length, a
good five foot ten in height at the tip of
his humped and huge fore-shoulders, he
seemed to justify the most extravagant
tales of pioneer and huntsman. His
hind-quarters were trim and fine-lined,
built apparently for speed, smooth-haired,
and of a grayish lion-color. But
his fore-shoulders, mounting to an enormous
hump, were of an elephantine
massiveness, and clothed in a dense,
curling, golden-brown growth of matted
hair. His mighty head was carried low,
almost to the level of his knees, on a neck
of colossal strength, which was draped,
together with the forelegs down to the
knees, in a flowing brown mane tipped
with black. His head, too, to the very
muzzle, wore the same luxuriant and
sombre drapery, out of which curved
viciously the keen-tipped crescent of his
horns. Dark, huge, and ominous, he
looked curiously out of place in the secure
and familiar tranquillity of his green
pasture.</p>

<p>For a distance of perhaps fifty yards,
at the back of the pasture, the range of
the buffalo herd adjoined that of the
moose, divided from it by that same
fence of heavy steel-wire mesh, supported
by iron posts, which surrounded the whole
range. One sunny and tingling day in
late October&mdash;such a day as makes the
blood race full red through all healthy
veins&mdash;a magnificent stranger was
brought to the Park, and turned into
the moose-range.</p>

<p>The newcomer was a New Brunswick
bull moose, captured on the Tobique
during the previous spring when the
snow was deep and soft, and purchased
for the Park by one of the big Eastern
lumber-merchants. The moose-herd had
consisted, hitherto, of four lonely cows,
and the splendid bull was a prize which
the Park had long been coveting. He
took lordly possession, forthwith, of the
submissive little herd, and led them off
at once from the curious crowds about
the gate to explore the wild-looking
thickets at the back of the pasture.
But no sooner had he fairly entered
these thickets than he found his further
progress barred by the steel-meshed fence.
This was a bitter disappointment, for he
had expected to go striding through
miles of alder swamp and dark spruce
woods, fleeing the hated world of men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
and bondage, before setting himself to
get acquainted with his new followers.
His high-strung temper was badly jarred.
He drew off, shaking his vast antlers, and
went shambling with spacious stride
down along the barrier towards the
brook. The four cows, in single file,
hurried after him anxiously, afraid he
might be snatched away from them.</p>

<p>Last Bull, standing solitary and morose
on a little knoll in his pasture, caught
sight of the strange, dark figure of the
running moose. A spark leapt into his
heavy eyes. He wheeled, pawed the
sod, put his muzzle to the ground, and
bellowed a sonorous challenge. The
moose stopped short and stared about
him, the stiff hair lifting angrily along
the ridge of his massive neck. Last
Bull lowered his head and tore up the
sod with his horns.</p>

<p>This vehement action caught the
eyes of the moose. At first he stared
in amazement, for he had never seen
any creature that looked like Last Bull.
The two were only about fifty or sixty
yards apart, across the little valley of
the bushy swamp. As he stared, his
irritation speedily overcame his amazement.
The curious-looking creature over
there on the knoll was defying him, was
challenging him. At this time of year
his blood was hot and quick for any
challenge. He gave vent to a short,
harsh, explosive cry, more like a grumbling
bleat than a bellow, and as unlike
the buffalo's challenge as could well be
imagined. Then he fell to thrashing the
nearest bushes violently with his antlers.
This, for some reason unknown to the
mere human chronicler, seemed to be
taken by Last Bull as a crowning insolence.
His long, tasselled tail went
stiffly up into the air, and he charged
wrathfully down the knoll. The moose,
with his heavy-muzzled head stuck
straight out scornfully before him, and
his antlers laid flat along his back,
strode down to the encounter with a
certain deadly deliberation. He was
going to fight. There was no doubt
whatever on that score. But he had
not quite made up his wary mind as to
how he would deal with this unknown
and novel adversary.</p>

<p>They looked not so unequally matched,
these two, the monarch of the Western
plains, and the monarch of the Northeastern
forests. Both had something
of the monstrous, the uncouth, about
them, as if they belonged not to this
modern day, but to some prehistoric
epoch when Earth moulded her children
on more lavish and less graceful lines.
The moose was like the buffalo in having
his hind-quarters relatively slight and
low, and his back sloping upwards to a
hump over the immensely developed
fore-shoulders. But he had much less
length of body, and much less bulk,
though perhaps eight or ten inches more
of height at the tip of the shoulder. His
hair was short, and darker than that of
his shaggy rival, being almost black
except on legs and belly. Instead of
carrying his head low, like the buffalo,
for feeding on the level prairies, he bore
it high, being in the main a tree-feeder.
But the greatest difference between the
two champions was in their heads and
horns. The antlers of the moose formed
a huge, fantastic, flatly palmated or
leaflike structure, separating into sharp
prongs along the edges, and spreading
more than four feet from tip to tip. To
compare them with the short, polished
crescent of the horns of Last Bull was
like comparing a two-handed broadsword<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
to a bowie-knife. And his head, instead
of being short, broad, ponderous,
and shaggy, like Last Bull's, was long,
close-haired, and massively horse-faced,
with a projecting upper lip heavy and
grim.</p>

<p>Had there been no impregnable steel
barrier between them, it is hard to say
which would have triumphed in the end,
the ponderous weight and fury of Last
Bull, or the ripping prongs and swift
wrath of the moose. The buffalo charged
down the knoll at a thundering gallop;
but just before reaching the fence he
checked himself violently. More than
once or twice before had those elastic
but impenetrable meshes given him his
lesson, hurling him back with humiliating
harshness when he dashed his bulk
against them. He had too lively a
memory of past discomfitures to risk a
fresh one now in the face of this insolent
foe. His matted front came against
the wire with a force so cunningly moderated
that he was not thrown back by
the recoil. And the keen points of his
horns went through the meshes with a
vehemence which might indeed have
done its work effectively had they come
in contact with the adversary. As it
was, however, they but prodded empty
air.</p>

<p>The moose, meanwhile, had been in
doubt whether to attack with his antlers,
as was his manner when encountering
foes of his own kind, or with his knife-edged
fore-hoofs, which were the weapons
he used against bears, wolves, or other
alien adversaries. Finally he seemed to
make up his mind that Last Bull, having
horns and a most redoubtable stature,
must be some kind of moose. In that
case, of course, it became a question of
antlers. Moreover, in his meetings with
rival bulls it had never been his wont
to depend upon a blind, irresistible
charge,&mdash;thereby leaving it open to an
alert opponent to slip aside and rip him
along the flank,&mdash;but rather to fence
warily for an advantage in the locking
of antlers, and then bear down his foe
by the fury and speed of his pushing.
It so happened, therefore, that he, too,
came not too violently against the
barrier. Loudly his vast spread of
antlers clashed upon the steel meshes;
and one short prong, jutting low over
his brow, pierced through and furrowed
deeply the matted forehead of the
buffalo.</p>

<p>As the blood streamed down over his
nostrils, obscuring one eye, Last Bull
quite lost his head with rage. Drawing
off, he hurled himself blindly upon the
barrier&mdash;only to be hurled back again
with a vigor that brought him to his
knees. But at the same time the moose,
on the other side of the fence, got a huge
surprise. Having his antlers against the
barrier when Last Bull charged, he was
forced back irresistibly upon his haunches
with a rudeness quite unlike anything
that he had ever before experienced.
His massive neck felt as if a pine tree
had fallen upon it, and he came back
to the charge quite beside himself with
bewilderment and rage.</p>

<p>By this time, however, the keepers
and Park attendants were arriving on
the scene, armed with pitchforks and
other unpleasant executors of authority.
Snorting, and bellowing, and grunting,
the monstrous duellists were forced apart;
and Last Bull, who had been taught
something of man's dominance, was
driven off to his stable and imprisoned.
He was not let out again for two whole
days. And by that time another fence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
parallel with the first and some five or
six feet distant from it, had been run up
between his range and that of the moose.
Over this impassable zone of neutrality,
for a few days, the two rivals flung insult
and futile defiance, till suddenly, becoming
tired of it all, they seemed to agree
to ignore each other's existence.</p>

<p>After this, Last Bull's sullenness of
temper appeared to grow upon him. He
was fond of drawing apart from the little
herd, and taking up his solitary post on
the knoll, where he would stand for an
hour at a time motionless except for the
switching of his long tail, and staring
steadily westward as if he knew where
the great past of his race had lain. In
that direction a dense grove of chestnuts,
maples, and oaks bounded the range,
cutting off the view of the city roofs, the
roar of the city traffic. Beyond the city
were mountains and wide waters which
he could not see; but beyond the waters
and the mountains stretched the green,
illimitable plains&mdash;which perhaps (who
knows?) in some faint vision inherited
from the ancestors whose myriads had
possessed them, his sombre eyes, in some
strange way, <i>could</i> see. Among the
keepers and attendants generally it was
said, with anxious regret, that perhaps
Last Bull was "going bad." But the
headkeeper, Payne, himself a son of
the plains, repudiated the idea. <i>He</i>
declared sympathetically that the great
bull was merely homesick, pining for
the wind-swept levels of the open country
(God's country, Payne called it!)
which his imprisoned hoofs had never
trodden.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the fact could not
be gainsaid that Last Bull was growing
more and more morose. The spectators,
strolling along the wide walk which
skirted the front of his range, seemed
to irritate him, and sometimes, when a
group had gathered to admire him, he
would turn his low-hung head and answer
their staring eyes with a kind of heavy
fury, as if he burned to break forth upon
them and seek vengeance for incalculable
wrongs. This smouldering indignation
against humanity extended
equally, if not more violently, to all
creatures who appeared to him as servants
or allies of humanity. The dogs
whom he sometimes saw passing, held
in leash by their masters or mistresses,
made him paw the earth scornfully if
he happened to be near the fence. The
patient horses who pulled the road-roller
or the noisy lawn-mower made his
eyes redden savagely. And he hated
with peculiar zest the roguish little trick
elephant, Bong, who would sometimes,
his inquisitive trunk swinging from side
to side, go lurching lazily by with a load
of squealing children on his back.</p>

<p>Bong, who was a favored character,
amiable and trustworthy, was allowed
the freedom of the Park in the early
morning, before visitors began to arrive
who might be alarmed at seeing an
elephant at large. He was addicted to
minding his own business, and never
paid the slightest attention to any
occupants of cage or enclosure. He
was quite unaware of the hostility which
he had aroused in the perverse and brooding
heart of Last Bull.</p>

<p>One crisp morning in late November,
when all the grass in the Park had been
blackened by frost, and the pools were
edged with silver rims of ice, and mists
were white and saffron about the scarce-risen
sun, and that autumn thrill was in
the air which gives one such an appetite,
Bong chanced to be strolling past the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
front of Last Bull's range. He did not
see Last Bull, who was nothing to him.
But, being just as hungry as he ought
to be on so stimulating a morning, he
did see, and note with interest, some
bundles of fresh hay on the other side
of the fence.</p>

<p>Now, Bong was no thief. But hay
had always seemed to him a free largess,
like grass and water, and this looked
like very good hay. So clear a conscience
had he on the subject that he
never thought of glancing around to see
if any of the attendants were looking.
Innocently he lurched up to the fence,
reached his lithe trunk through, gathered
a neat wisp of the hay, and stuffed it
happily into his curious, narrow, pointed
mouth. Yes, he had not been mistaken.
It was good hay. With great
satisfaction he reached in for another
mouthful.</p>

<p>Last Bull, as it happened, was standing
close by, but a little to one side. He
had been ignoring, so far, his morning
ration. He was not hungry. And, moreover,
he rather disapproved of the hay
because it had the hostile man-smell
strong upon it. Nevertheless, he recognized
it very clearly as his property, to
be eaten when he should feel inclined to
eat it. His wrath, then, was only
equalled by his amazement when he saw
the little elephant's presumptuous gray
trunk reach in and coolly help itself.
For a moment he forgot to do anything
whatever about it. But when, a few
seconds later, that long, curling trunk of
Bong's insinuated itself again and appropriated
another bundle of the now
precious hay, the outraged owner
bestirred himself. With a curt roar,
that was more of a cough or a grunt
than a bellow, he lunged forward and
strove to pin the intruding trunk to
the ground.</p>

<p>With startled alacrity Bong withdrew
his trunk, but just in time to save it
from being mangled. For an instant
he stood with the member held high in
air, bewildered by what seemed to him
such a gratuitous attack. Then his
twinkling little eyes began to blaze, and
he trumpeted shrilly with anger. The
next moment, reaching over the fence,
he brought down the trunk on Last
Bull's hump with such a terrible flail-like
blow that the great buffalo stumbled
forward upon his knees.</p>

<p>He was up again in an instant and
hurling himself madly against the inexorable
steel which separated him from
his foe. Bong hesitated for a second,
then, reaching over the fence once more,
clutched Last Bull maliciously around
the base of his horns and tried to twist
his neck. This enterprise, however, was
too much even for the elephant's titanic
powers, for Last Bull's greatest strength
lay in the muscles of his ponderous and
corded neck. Raving and bellowing, he
plunged this way and that, striving in
vain to wrench himself free from that
incomprehensible, snake-like thing which
had fastened upon him. Bong, trumpeting
savagely, braced himself with widespread
pillars of legs, and between them
it seemed that the steel fence must go
down under such cataclysmic shocks as
it was suffering. But the noisy violence
of the battle presently brought its own
ending. An amused but angry squad of
attendants came up and stopped it, and
Bong, who seemed plainly the aggressor,
was hustled off to his stall in deep
disgrace.</p>

<p>Last Bull was humiliated. In this
encounter things had happened which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
he could in no way comprehend; and
though, beyond an aching in neck and
shoulders, he felt none the worse physically,
he had nevertheless a sense of
having been worsted, of having been
treated with ignominy, in spite of the fact
that it was his foe, and not he, who had
retired from the field. For several days
he wore a subdued air and kept about
meekly with his docile cows. Then his
old, bitter moodiness reasserted itself,
and he resumed his solitary broodings
on the crest of the knoll.</p>

<p>When the winter storms came on, it
had been Last Bull's custom to let
himself be housed luxuriously at nightfall,
with the rest of the herd, in the
warm and ample buffalo-shed. But this
winter he made such difficulty about
going in that at last Payne decreed that
he should have his own way and stay
out. "It will do him no harm, and may
cool his peppery blood some!" had been
the keeper's decision. So the door was
left open, and Last Bull entered or
refrained, according to his whim. It
was noticed, however,&mdash;and this struck
a chord of answering sympathy in the
plainsman's imaginative temperament,&mdash;that,
though on ordinary nights he might
come in and stay with the herd under
shelter, on nights of driving storm, if
the tempest blew from the west or northwest,
Last Bull was sure to be out on
the naked knoll to face it. When the
fine sleet or stinging rain drove past him,
filling his nostrils with their cold, drenching
his matted mane, and lashing his
narrowed eyes, what visions swept
through his troubled, half-comprehending
brain, no one may know. But Payne,
with understanding born of sympathy
and a common native soil, catching sight
of his dark bulk under the dark of the
low sky, was wont to declare that <i>he</i>
knew. He would say that Last Bull's
eyes discerned, black under the hurricane,
but lit strangely with the flash
of keen horns and rolling eyes and frothed
nostrils, the endless and innumerable
droves of the buffalo, with the plains
wolf skulking on their flanks, passing,
passing, southward into the final dark.
In the roar of the wind, declared Payne,
Last Bull, out there in the night, listened
to the trampling of all those vanished
droves. And though the other keepers
insisted to each other, quite privately,
that their chief talked a lot of nonsense
about "that there mean-tempered old
buffalo," they nevertheless came gradually
to look upon Last Bull with a kind
of awe, and to regard his surly whims
as privileged.</p>

<p>It chanced that winter that men were
driving a railway tunnel beneath a corner
of the Park. The tunnel ran for a short
distance under the front of Last Bull's
range, and passed close by the picturesque
cottage occupied by Payne and two of
his assistants. At this point the level
of the Park was low, and the shell of
earth was thin above the tunnel roof.</p>

<p>There came a Sunday afternoon, after
days of rain and penetrating January
thaw, when sun and air combined to
cheat the earth with an illusion of spring.
The buds and the mould breathed of
April, and gay crowds flocked to the
Park, to make the most of winter's
temporary repulse. Just when things
were at their gayest, with children's
voices clamoring everywhere like starlings,
and Bong, the little elephant,
swinging good-naturedly up the broad
white track with all the load he had
room for on his back, there came an
ominous jar and rumble, like the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
of an earthquake, which ran along the
front of Last Bull's range.</p>

<p>With sure instinct, Bong turned tail
and fled with his young charges away
across the grassland. The crowds, hardly
knowing what they fled from, with
screams and cries and blanched faces,
followed the elephant's example. A
moment later and, with a muffled crash,
all along the front of the range, the
earth sank into the tunnel, carrying
with it half a dozen panels of Last
Bull's hated fence.</p>

<p>Almost in a moment the panic of the
crowd subsided. Every one realized
just what had happened. Moreover,
thanks to Bong's timely alarm, every
one had got out of the way in good
season. All fear of earthquake being
removed, the crowd flocked back eagerly
to stare down into the wrecked tunnel,
which formed now a sort of gaping,
chaotic ditch, with sides at some points
precipitous and at others brokenly sloping.
The throng was noisy with excited
interest and with relief at having escaped
so cleanly. The break had run just
beneath one corner of the keepers' cottage,
tearing away a portion of the
foundation and wrenching the structure
slightly aside without overthrowing it.
Payne, who had been in the midst of
his Sunday toilet, came out upon his
twisted porch, half undressed and with
a shaving-brush covered with lather in
his hand. He gave one look at the damage
which had been wrought, then
plunged indoors again to throw his
clothes on, at the same time sounding
the hurry call for the attendants in
other quarters of the Park.</p>

<p>Last Bull, who had been standing on
his knoll, with his back to the throngs,
had wheeled in astonishment at the
heavy sound of the cave-in. For a few
minutes he had stared sullenly, not
grasping the situation. Then very slowly
it dawned on him that his prison walls
had fallen. Yes, surely, there at last
lay his way to freedom, his path to the
great open spaces for which he dumbly
and vaguely hungered. With stately
deliberation he marched down from his
knoll to investigate.</p>

<p>But presently another idea came into
his slow mind. He saw the clamorous
crowds flocking back and ranging themselves
along the edge of the chasm.
These were his enemies. They were
coming to balk him. A terrible madness
surged through all his veins. He bellowed
savage warning and came thundering
down the field, nose to earth, dark,
mountainous, irresistible.</p>

<p>The crowd yelled and shrank back.
"He can't get across!" shouted some.
But others cried: "He can! He's
coming! Save yourselves!" And with
shrieks they scattered wildly across the
open, making for the kiosks, the pavilions,
the trees, anything that seemed to
promise hiding or shelter from that
on-rushing doom.</p>

<p>At the edge of the chasm&mdash;at this
point forming not an actual drop, but
a broken slide&mdash;Last Bull hardly paused.
He plunged down, rolled over in the
d&eacute;bris, struggled to his feet again
instantly, and went ploughing and snorting
up the opposite steep. As his colossal
front, matted with mud, loomed up over
the brink, his little eyes rolling and
flaming, and the froth flying from his
red nostrils, he formed a very nightmare
of horror to those fugitives who dared
to look behind them.</p>

<p>Surmounting the brink, he paused.
There were so many enemies, he knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
not which to pursue first. But straight
ahead, in the very middle of the open,
and far from any shelter, he saw a huddled
group of children and nurses fleeing
impotently and aimlessly. Shrill cries
came from the cluster, which danced
with colors, scarlet and yellow and blue
and vivid pink. To the mad buffalo,
these were the most conspicuous and the
loudest of his foes, and therefore the
most dangerous. With a bellow he
flung his tail straight in the air, and
charged after them.</p>

<p>An appalling hush fell, for a few heartbeats,
all over the field. Then from
different quarters appeared uniformed
attendants, racing and shouting frantically
to divert the bull's attention.
From fleeing groups black-coated men
leapt forth, armed only with their
walking-sticks, and rushed desperately
to defend the flock of children, who now,
in the extremity of their terror, were
tumbling as they ran. Some of the nurses
were fleeing far in front, while others, the
faithful ones, with eyes starting from
their heads, grabbed up their little charges
and struggled on under the burden.</p>

<p>Already Last Bull was halfway across
the space which divided him from his
foes. The ground shook under his ponderous
gallop. At this moment Payne
reappeared on the broken porch.</p>

<p>One glance showed him that no one
was near enough to intervene. With a
face stern and sorrowful he lifted the
deadly .405 Winchester which he had
brought out with him. The spot he
covered was just behind Last Bull's
mighty shoulder.</p>

<p>The smokeless powder spoke with a
small, venomous report, unlike the black
powder's noisy reverberation. Last Bull
stumbled. But recovering himself instantly,
he rushed on. He was hurt,
and he felt it was those fleeing foes who
had done it. A shade of perplexity
darkened Payne's face. He fired again.
This time his aim was true. The heavy
expanding bullet tore straight through
bone and muscle and heart, and Last
Bull lurched forward upon his head,
ploughing up the turf for yards. As
his mad eyes softened and filmed, he
saw once more, perhaps,&mdash;or so the
heavy-hearted keeper who had slain him
would have us believe,&mdash;the shadowy
plains unrolling under the wild sky, and
the hosts of his vanished kindred drifting
past into the dark.</p>

<h2>SECTION X. ROMANCE CYCLES AND LEGEND</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p><i>The material included.</i> The heading adopted for this section is used somewhat
loosely to include those many and varied collections of stories which have with the
passage of time been gradually brought together into so-called cycles, unified around
some central figure, or by means of some kind of framework. It would thus bring
into its scope the series of stories which make up the Greek <i>Odyssey</i>, the Anglo-Saxon
<i>Beowulf</i>, the Finnish <i>Kalevala</i>, and other national epics. It would include the stories
centering around King Arthur, Siegfried, Roland, the Cid, Alexander, Charlemagne,
Robin Hood, and Reynard the Fox. Besides all these cycles and others like them,
there is a great body of separate legends of persons and places, exemplified by "The
Proud King," that seem almost to constitute a work by themselves. The extended
body of eastern stories known as <i>The Arabian Nights</i> are also placed here, as is Cervantes'
<i>Don Quixote</i>. The last inclusion may seem to violate even the wide range of
the heading, as <i>Don Quixote</i> is distinctly one of the world's great modern masterpieces,
and is by a known author. But that book is after all a cycle of adventures
with a central figure not unlike the romance cycles, and, since it is popularly supposed
to have had its origin in the purpose of humorously satirizing the romances of
chivalry, it may be allowed to stand in connection with them.</p>

<p><i>The place for such stories.</i> The developing child soon passes out of the period
where the old fairy stories and their modern analogues satisfy his needs. He comes
into a period of hero-worship where he demands not only courage and prowess of
magnificent proportions, but also a sinking of self in as equally magnificent and
disinterested service of great causes. To the child's mind there is nothing fantastical
about the chivalric ideas of courtesy, and friendship, and all high personal ideals.
It is the natural food of his mind. He will allow nothing mean or unclean. It
seems, roughly speaking, that the time of greatest appeal for such stories is about
the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. By the end of that period he is already well
along toward an interest in the real men and women of history, toward a more realistic
and practical conception of the problems of human life.</p>

<p><i>The problems of choice and adaptation.</i> The wealth of material available is so
great as to be bewildering. As yet there is no common agreement as to just which
stories are best for our purpose, nor is there any as to where particular stories should
be used. The adapters and story-tellers differ much in their views on these questions.
Young teachers, it is clear, cannot be expected to know this vast field in any detail.
The saving fact is that teachers can hardly make a mistake by using any story that
has awakened their own interest and enthusiasm, and which, for that reason, they
will be able to present in a simple and striking form. Having in mind, then, the
beginning teacher, we make the following specific suggestions:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. <i>Beowulf.</i> The inexperienced teacher will find a splendid version, "The
Story of Beowulf," ready-made in Wyche's <i>Some Great Stories and How to Tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
Them</i>. To work from the complete epic, use any of the translations by Child,
Tinker, Gummere, or Hall. "Perhaps it is not too much to assert .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'it'">in</ins> its lofty spirit, its vigor, and its sincerity, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it reflects traits which are
distinctive of English-speaking people throughout the world."</p>

<p>2. <i>King Arthur.</i> The final source must be Sir Thomas Malory's <i>Le Morte
D'Arthur</i>, represented in the following pages by Nos. <a href="#Note_401">401</a>, <a href="#Note_402">402</a>, and <a href="#Note_403">403</a>. Some
passages from Malory should be read to the class. For suggestions as to method
in handling the stories, see Wyche as above, where there is a fine brief version.
In <i>King Arthur and His Knights</i>, by Mrs. Warren (Maude Radford), may be found
a good working version of the whole cycle. ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In delicacy of feeling, in
reverence for women, in courtesy to friend and foe, the Arthurian story foreshadowed
much that is gentlest and best in modern civilization."</p>

<p>3. <i>Robin Hood.</i> Go at once to one of the simple prose versions of the story.
Satisfactory ones are those by Miss Tappan, by Mrs. Warren, or by Howard
Pyle (the shorter version). As time and opportunity offer read the simple old
ballads which are the source of the story of "merry" Sherwood. "If ever verse
lashed abuse with a smile, it is this. The sun shines brightly overhead; it is
a good world to be alive in, its wrongs are being righted, and its very misfortunes
are ultimately to bring happier times."</p>

<p>4. A few stories about Roland, Siegfried, the Cid, Charlemagne, and others
may be used by teachers who have had opportunity to get acquainted with those
great figures, or who have access to some of the authorities listed in the bibliography.
This material is more difficult to handle satisfactorily than that already
discussed, and may well be sparingly used, if not omitted altogether. For a
general collection of legends, the ideal as to choice and method of presentation
is Scudder's <i>The Book of Legends</i> (No. <a href="#Note_412">412</a>). From <i>The Arabian Nights</i> use
"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" (No. <a href="#Note_398">398</a>), "Aladdin and the Wonderful
Lamp," and "The Stories of Sindbad the Sailor." Almost any of the accessible
versions will be satisfactory. For <i>Reynard the Fox</i>, the one adaptation that
presents the story in a fairly good form for children is that made by Sir Henry
Cole, available as edited by Joseph Jacobs (Nos. <a href="#Note_399">399</a> and <a href="#Note_400">400</a>). Perhaps as
much of <i>Don Quixote</i> is given in this text (Nos. <a href="#Note_405">405</a>-<a href="#Note_411">411</a>) as teachers can use. A
full translation is a satisfactory source for this story, although the shortened
forms by Havell or Parry are admirable.</p></div>


<h3>SUGGESTIONS FOR READING</h3>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Most of the books on story-telling have discussions of the best ways of dealing with the romance
material. Especially valuable in this connection are Wyche, <i>Great Stories and How to Tell Them</i>,
and Lyman, <i>Story Telling</i>. For scholarly and yet not too difficult books giving a perspective of the
entire field see W. W. Lawrence, <i>Medieval Story and the Beginnings of the Social Ideals of English-speaking
People</i>, or W. P. Ker, <i>Epic and Romance</i>. Consult MacClintock, "Hero-Tales and
Romances," <i>Literature in the Elementary School</i>, chap. viii.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span></p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_398" id="Note_398">398</a></h3>

<div class="hang1"><i>The Arabian Nights' Entertainment</i> or <i>Thousand
and One Nights</i> is a collection of
about four hundred old oriental stories,
chiefly from Persia, India, and Arabia.
They were brought together probably in
the thirteenth century and told orally
as stories told to entertain King Shahriyar;
but scholars think the collection
was not written until some time between
the years 1350 and 1550. Some of
the stories probably were told as early
as the ninth century. The stories are of
various kinds&mdash;fables, anecdotes, legends,
hero stories, wonder stories, and romances.
"The Story of Alnaschar" (No. <a href="#Note_235">235</a>
in this book) is one of the fables. The
collection became known to European
readers in 1704, when it was translated
from the Arabic by a French scholar named
Galland. Since that time the fables have
been translated extensively. The translation
into English by Lane is the most valuable
one for a teacher who wishes to have all
of the book that is fit for public use. Like
many of the world's great compilations
of this sort, it is made up of a mixture of
good and bad. The oriental play of
imagination in these stories and the background
of old Eastern scenery and customs
have made them a source of entertainment
and instruction for all civilized nations.
The story that follows has always been
one of the favorites among oriental wonder
stories, and is given in a familiar traditional
version.</div>


<h4><br />ALI BABA, AND THE
FORTY THIEVES</h4>

<p>In a town in Persia there lived two
brothers, the sons of a poor man; the
one was named Cassim, and the other
Ali Baba. Cassim, the elder, married a
wife with a considerable fortune, and
lived at his ease in a handsome house,
with plenty of servants; but the wife of
Ali Baba was as poor as himself; they
dwelt in a mean cottage in the suburbs
of the city, and he maintained his
family by cutting wood in a neighboring
forest.</p>

<p>One day when Ali Baba was in the
forest and preparing to load his three
asses with the wood he had cut, he saw
a troop of horsemen coming towards him.
He had often heard of robbers who infested
that forest, and, in a great fright,
he hastily climbed a large thick tree,
which stood near the foot of a rock, and
hid himself among the branches.</p>

<p>The horsemen soon galloped up to
the rock, where they all dismounted.
Ali Baba counted forty of them, and he
could not doubt but they were thieves,
by their ill-looking countenances. They
each took a loaded portmanteau from
his horse; and he who seemed to be their
captain, turning to the rock, said, "Open
Sesame," and immediately a door opened
in the rock, and all the robbers passed in,
when the door shut itself. In a short
time the door opened again, and the
forty robbers came out, followed by
their captain, who said, "Shut Sesame."
The door instantly closed; and the troop,
mounting their horses, were presently
out of sight.</p>

<p>Ali Baba remained in the tree a long
time, and seeing that the robbers did
not return, he ventured down, and,
approaching close to the rock, said,
"Open Sesame." Immediately the door
flew open, and Ali Baba beheld a spacious
cavern, very light, and filled with all
sorts of possessions,&mdash;merchandise, rich
stuffs, and heaps of gold and silver coin,
which these robbers had taken from
merchants and travelers.</p>

<p>Ali Baba then went in search of his
asses, and having brought them to the
rock, took as many bags of gold coin as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
they could carry, and put them on their
backs, covering them with some loose
fagots of wood. Afterwards (not forgetting
to say "Shut Sesame") he drove
the asses back to the city; and having
unloaded them in the stable belonging
to his cottage, carried the bags into the
house and spread the gold coin out upon
the floor before his wife.</p>

<p>His wife, delighted with so much
money, wanted to count it; but finding
it would take up too much time, she was
resolved to measure it, and running to
the house of Ali Baba's brother, she
entreated them to lend her a small measure.
Cassim's wife was very proud and
envious. "I wonder," she said to herself,
"what sort of grain such poor people
can have to measure; but I am determined
I will find out what they are
doing." So before she gave the measure,
she artfully rubbed the bottom with
some suet.</p>

<p>Away ran Ali Baba's wife, measured
her money, and helped her husband to
bury it in the yard. Then she carried
back the measure to her brother-in-law's
house, without perceiving that a piece
of gold was left sticking to the bottom of
it. "Fine doings, indeed!" cried Cassim's
wife to her husband, after examining
the measure. "Your brother there,
who pretends to be so poor, is richer
than you are, for he does not count his
money, but measures it."</p>

<p>Cassim, hearing these words and seeing
the piece of gold, grew as envious as
his wife; and hastening to his brother,
threatened to inform the Cadi of his
wealth if he did not confess to him how
he came by it. Ali Baba without hesitation
told him the history of the robbers
and the secret of the cave, and offered
him half his treasure; but the envious
Cassim disdained so poor a sum, resolving
to have fifty times more than that
out of the robbers' cave. Accordingly
he rose early the next morning and set
out with ten mules loaded with great
chests. He found the rock easily enough
by Ali Baba's description; and having
said "Open Sesame," he gained admission
into the cave, where he found more
treasure than he had expected to behold
even from his brother's account of it.</p>

<p>He immediately began to gather bags
of gold and pieces of rich brocade, all
which he piled close to the door; but
when he had got together as much as
his ten mules could possibly carry, or
even more, and wanted to get out to
load them, the thoughts of his wonderful
riches had made him entirely forget the
word which caused the door to open.
In vain he tried "Bame," "Fame,"
"Lame," "Tetame," and a thousand
others. The door remained as immovable
as the rock itself, notwithstanding
Cassim kicked and screamed till he was
ready to drop with fatigue and vexation.</p>

<p>Presently he heard the sound of horses'
feet, which he rightly concluded to be
the robbers, and he trembled lest he
should now fall a victim to his thirst for
riches. He resolved, however, to make
an effort to escape; and when he heard
the "Sesame" pronounced, and saw the
door open, he sprang out, but was
instantly put to death by the swords
of the robbers.</p>

<p>The thieves now held a council, but
not one of them could possibly guess by
what means Cassim had got into the
cave. They saw the heaps of treasure
he had piled ready to take away, but
they did not miss what Ali Baba had
secured before. At length they agreed
to cut Cassim's body into four quarters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
and hang the pieces within the cave,
that it might terrify any one from further
attempts; and also determined not to
return themselves for some time to the
cave for fear of being watched and discovered.</p>

<p>When Cassim's wife saw night come
on, and her husband not returned, she
became greatly terrified; she watched at
her window till daybreak and then went
to tell Ali Baba of her fears. Cassim had
not informed him of his design of going
to the cave; but Ali Baba, now hearing
of his journey thither, went immediately
in search of him. He drove his asses to
the forest without delay. He was
alarmed to see blood near the rock; and
on entering the cave, he found the body
of his unfortunate brother cut to pieces
and hung up within the door. It was
now too late to save him; but he took
down the quarters and put them upon
one of his asses, covering them with
fagots of wood; and, weeping for the
miserable end of his brother, he regained
the city. The door of his brother's
house was opened by Morgiana, an intelligent,
faithful female slave, who, Ali
Baba knew, was worthy to be trusted
with the secret.</p>

<p>He therefore delivered the body to
Morgiana, and went himself to impart
the sad tidings to the wife of Cassim.
The poor woman was deeply afflicted,
and reproached herself with her foolish
envy and curiosity, as being the cause of
her husband's death; but Ali Baba having
convinced her of the necessity of being
very discreet, she checked her lamentations
and resolved to leave everything
to the management of Morgiana.</p>

<p>Morgiana, having washed the body,
hastened to an apothecary's and asked
for some particular medicine, saying that
it was for her master Cassim, who was
dangerously ill. She took care to spread
the report of Cassim's illness throughout
the neighborhood; and as they saw Ali
Baba and his wife going daily to the house
of their brother, in great affliction, they
were not surprised to hear shortly that
Cassim had died of his disorder.</p>

<p>The next difficulty was to bury him
without discovery; but Morgiana was
ready to contrive a plan for that also.
She put on her veil and went to a distant
part of the city very early in the morning,
where she found a poor cobbler just
opening his stall. She put a piece of gold
into his hand, and told him he should
have another, if he would suffer himself
to be blindfolded and go with her,
carrying his tools with him. Mustapha,
the cobbler, hesitated at first, but the
gold tempted him and he consented; when
Morgiana, carefully covering his eyes, so
that he could not see a step of the way,
led him to Cassim's house; and taking
him into the room where the body was
lying, removed the bandage from his
eyes, and bade him sew the mangled
limbs together. Mustapha obeyed her
order; and having received two pieces of
gold, was led blindfold the same way
back to his own stall.</p>

<p>Morgiana then covered the body with
a winding-sheet and sent for the undertaker
to make preparations for the
funeral. Cassim was buried with all due
solemnity the same day. Ali Baba now
removed his few goods, and all the gold
coin that he had brought home from the
cavern, to the house of his deceased
brother, of which he took possession;
and Cassim's widow received every kind
attention from both Ali Baba and his wife.</p>

<p>After an interval of some months, the
troop of robbers again visited their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
retreat in the forest, and were completely
astonished to find the body taken
away from the cave, and everything else
remaining in its usual order. "We are
discovered," said the captain, "and shall
certainly be undone, if you do not adopt
speedy measures to prevent our ruin.
Which of you, my brave comrades, will
undertake to search out the villain who
is in possession of our secret?"</p>

<p>One of the boldest of the troop advanced,
and offered himself; and was
accepted on the following conditions:
namely, that if he succeeded in his enterprise,
he was to be made second in command
of the troop; but that if he brought
false intelligence, he was immediately to
be put to death. The bold robber readily
agreed to the conditions; and having disguised
himself, he proceeded to the city.</p>

<p>He arrived there about daybreak, and
found the cobbler Mustapha in his stall,
which was always open before any other
shop in the town. "Good morrow,
friend," said the robber, as he passed
the stall, "you rise betimes; I should
think old as you are, you could scarcely
see to work by this light."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir," replied the cobbler,
"old as I am, I do not want for good
eyesight; as you must needs believe, when
I tell you I sewed a dead body together
the other day, where I had not so good
a light as I have now."</p>

<p>"A dead body!" exclaimed the robber;
"you mean, I suppose, that you sewed
up the winding-sheet for a dead body."</p>

<p>"I mean no such thing," replied
Mustapha; "I tell you that I sewed the
four quarters of a man together."</p>

<p>This was enough to convince the robber
he had luckily met with the very man who
could give him the information he was
in search of. However he did not wish
to appear eager to learn the particulars,
lest he should alarm the cobbler. "Ha!
ha!" said he, "I find, good Mr. Cobbler,
that you perceive I am a stranger here,
and you wish to make me believe that
the people of your city do impossible
things."</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Mustapha in a loud
and angry tone, "I sewed a dead body
together with my own hands."&mdash;"Then
I suppose you can tell me also where you
performed this wonderful business."
Upon this, Mustapha related every particular
of his being led blindfold to the
house, etc.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend," said the robber, "it
is a fine story, I confess, but not very
easy to believe; however, if you will convince
me by showing me the house you
talk of, I will give you four pieces of
gold to make amends for my unbelief."</p>

<p>"I think," said the cobbler, after considering
awhile, "that if you were to
blindfold me, I should remember every
turning we made; but with my eyes
open I am sure I should never find it."
Accordingly the robber covered Mustapha's
eyes with his handkerchief; and the
cobbler led him through most of the principal
streets, and stopping by Cassim's
door, said, "Here it is; I went no further
than this house."</p>

<p>The robber immediately marked the
door with a piece of chalk; and, giving
Mustapha his four pieces of gold, dismissed
him. Shortly after the thief and
Mustapha had quitted the door, Morgiana,
coming home from market, perceived
the little mark of white chalk on
the door. Suspecting something was
wrong, she directly marked four doors
on one side and five on the other of her
master's, in exactly the same manner,
without saying a word to any one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span></p>

<p>The robber meantime rejoined his
troop and boasted greatly of his success.
His captain and comrades praised his
diligence; and being well armed, they
proceeded to the town in different disguises,
and in separate parties of three
and four together.</p>

<p>It was agreed among them that they
were to meet in the market-place at the
dusk of evening, and that the captain
and the robber who had discovered the
house were to go there first, to find out
to whom it belonged. When they arrived
in the street, having a lantern with them,
they began to examine the doors, and
found to their confusion and astonishment
that ten doors were marked
exactly alike. The robber, who was the
captain's guide, could not say a word in
explanation of this mystery; and when
the disappointed troop got back to the
forest, his enraged companions ordered
him to be put to death.</p>

<p>Another now offered himself upon the
same conditions as the former; and
having bribed Mustapha, and discovered
the house, he made a mark with the dark
red chalk upon the door, in a part that
was not in the least conspicuous; and
carefully examined the surrounding doors,
to be certain that no such marks were
upon them. But nothing could escape
the prying eyes of Morgiana; scarcely
had the robber departed, when she discovered
the red mark; and getting some
red chalk, she marked seven doors on
each side, precisely in the same place and
in the same manner. The robber, valuing
himself highly upon the precautions
he had taken, triumphantly conducted
his captain to the spot; but great indeed
was his confusion and dismay when he
found it impossible to say which, among
fifteen houses marked exactly alike, was
the right one. The captain, furious with
his disappointment, returned again with
the troop to the forest; and the second
robber was also condemned to death.</p>

<p>The captain having lost two of his
troop, judged that their hands were more
active than their heads in such services;
and he resolved to employ no other of
them, but to go himself upon the business.
Accordingly he repaired to the
city and addressed himself to the cobbler
Mustapha, who, for six pieces of gold,
readily performed the services for him he
had done for the other two strangers.
The captain, much wiser than his men,
did not amuse himself with setting a
mark upon the door, but attentively
considered the house, counted the number
of windows, and passed by it very
often, to be certain that he should know
it again.</p>

<p>He then returned to the forest, and
ordered his troop to go into the town,
and buy nineteen mules and thirty-eight
large jars, one full of oil and the rest
empty. In two or three days the jars
were bought, and all things in readiness;
and the captain having put a man into
each jar, properly armed, the jars being
rubbed on the outside with oil, and the
covers having holes bored in them for
the men to breathe through, loaded his
mules, and in the habit of an oil-merchant
entered the town in the dusk of the evening.
He proceeded to the street where
Ali Baba dwelt, and found him sitting
in the porch of his house. "Sir," said
he to Ali Baba, "I have brought this oil
a great way to sell, and am too late for
this day's market. As I am quite a
stranger in this town, will you do me the
favor to let me put my mules into your
court-yard, and direct me where I may
lodge to-night?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span></p>

<p>Ali Baba, who was a very good-natured
man, welcomed the pretended oil-merchant
very kindly, and offered him a bed
in his own house; and having ordered the
mules to be unloaded in the yard, and
properly fed, he invited his guest in to
supper. The captain, having seen the jars
placed ready in the yard, followed Ali Baba
into the house, and after supper was shown
to the chamber where he was to sleep.</p>

<p>It happened that Morgiana was
obliged to sit up later that night than
usual, to get ready her master's bathing
linen for the following morning; and
while she was busy about the fire, her
lamp went out, and there was no more
oil in the house. After considering what
she could possibly do for a light, she
recollected the thirty-eight oil jars in the
yard and determined to take a little oil
out of one of them for her lamp. She
took her oil pot in her hand and approached
the first jar; the robber within
said, "Is it time, captain?"</p>

<p>Any other slave, on hearing a man in
an oil jar, would have screamed out; but
the prudent Morgiana instantly recollected
herself, and replied softly, "No,
not yet; lie still till I call you." She
passed on to every jar, receiving the
same question and making the same
answer, till she came to the last, which
was really filled with oil.</p>

<p>Morgiana was now convinced that this
was a plot of the robbers to murder her
master, Ali Baba; so she ran back to
the kitchen and brought out a large
kettle, which she filled with oil, and set
it on a great wood fire; and as soon as it
boiled she went and poured into the jars
sufficient of the boiling oil to kill every
man within them. Having done this she
put out her fire and her lamp, and crept
softly to her chamber.</p>

<p>The captain of the robbers, finding
everything quiet in the house, and perceiving
no light anywhere, arose and
went down into the yard to assemble
his men. Coming to the first jar, he
felt the steam of the boiled oil; he ran
hastily to the rest and found every one
of his troop put to death in the same
manner. Full of rage and despair at
having failed in his design, he forced the
lock of a door that led into the garden
and made his escape over the walls.</p>

<p>On the following morning Morgiana
related to her master, Ali Baba, his
wonderful deliverance from the pretended
oil-merchant and his gang of robbers.
Ali Baba at first could scarcely credit
her tale; but when he saw the robbers
dead in the jars, he could not sufficiently
praise her courage and sagacity; and
without letting any one else into the
secret, he and Morgiana the next night
buried the thirty-seven thieves in a deep
trench at the bottom of the garden. The
jars and mules, as he had no use for
them, were sent from time to time to the
different markets and sold.</p>

<p>While Ali Baba took these measures
to prevent his and Cassim's adventures
in the forest from being known, the captain
returned to his cave, and for some
time abandoned himself to grief and
despair. At length, however, he determined
to adopt a new scheme for the
destruction of Ali Baba. He removed
by degrees all the valuable merchandise
from the cave to the city and took a
shop exactly opposite to Ali Baba's
house. He furnished this shop with
everything that was rare and costly, and
went by the name of the merchant Cogia
Hassan. Many persons made acquaintance
with the stranger; among others,
Ali Baba's son went every day to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
shop. The pretended Cogia Hassan soon
appeared to be very fond of Ali Baba's
son, offered him many presents, and
often detained him at dinner, on which
occasions he treated him in the handsomest
manner.</p>

<p>Ali Baba's son thought it was necessary
to make some return to these civilities,
and pressed his father to invite Cogia
Hassan to supper. Ali Baba made no
objection, and the invitation was accordingly
given. The artful Cogia Hassan
would not too hastily accept this invitation,
but pretended he was not fond of
going into company, and that he had
business which demanded his presence
at home. These excuses only made Ali
Baba's son the more eager to take him
to his father's house; and after repeated
solicitations, the merchant consented to
sup at Ali Baba's house the next evening.</p>

<p>A most excellent supper was provided,
which Morgiana cooked in the best manner,
and as was her usual custom, she
carried in the first dish herself. The
moment she looked at Cogia Hassan,
she knew it was the pretended oil-merchant.
The prudent Morgiana did
not say a word to any one of this discovery,
but sent the other slaves into
the kitchen and waited at table herself;
and while Cogia Hassan was drinking,
she perceived he had a dagger hid under
his coat.</p>

<p>When supper was ended, and the
dessert and wine on the table, Morgiana
went away and dressed herself in the
habit of a dancing-girl; she next called
Abdalla, a fellow slave, to play on his
tabor while she danced. As soon as she
appeared at the parlor door, her master,
who was very fond of seeing her dance,
ordered her to come in to entertain his
guest with some of her best dancing.
Cogia Hassan was not very well satisfied
with this entertainment, yet was compelled,
for fear of discovering himself, to
seem pleased with the dancing, while, in
fact, he wished Morgiana a great way off,
and was quite alarmed lest he should
lose his opportunity of murdering Ali
Baba and his son.</p>

<p>Morgiana danced several dances with
the utmost grace and agility; and then
drawing a poniard from her girdle, she
performed many surprising things with
it, sometimes presenting the point to
one and sometimes to another, and then
seemed to strike it into her own bosom.
Suddenly she paused, and holding the
poniard in the right hand, presented her
left to her master as if begging some
money; upon which Ali Baba and his
son each gave her a small piece of money.
She then turned to the pretended Cogia
Hassan, and while he was putting his
hand into his purse, she plunged the
poniard into his heart.</p>

<p>"Wretch!" cried Ali Baba, "thou hast
ruined me and my family."</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Morgiana, "I have
preserved, and not ruined you and your
son. Look well at this traitor, and you
will find him to be the pretended oil-merchant
who came once before to rob
and murder you."</p>

<p>Ali Baba pulled off the turban and the
cloak which the false Cogia Hassan wore
and discovered that he was not only the
pretended oil-merchant, but the captain
of the forty robbers who had slain his
brother Cassim; nor could he doubt that
his perfidious aim had been to destroy
him, and probably his son, with the concealed
dagger. Ali Baba, who felt the new
obligation he owed to Morgiana for thus
saving his life a second time, embraced
her and said, "My dear Morgiana, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
give you your liberty; but my gratitude
must not stop there: I will also
marry you to my son, who can esteem
and admire you no less than does his
father." Then turning to his son, he
added, "You, my son, will not refuse the
wife I offer; for, in marrying Morgiana,
you take to wife the preserver and benefactor
of yourself and family." The son,
far from showing any dislike, readily and
joyfully accepted his proposed bride, having
long entertained an affection for the
good slave Morgiana.</p>

<p>Having rejoiced in their deliverance,
they buried the captain that night with
great privacy, in the trench along with
his troop of robbers; and a few days afterwards,
Ali Baba celebrated the marriage
of his son and Morgiana with a sumptuous
entertainment. Every one who knew
Morgiana said she was worthy of her
good fortune, and highly commended
her master's generosity toward her.</p>

<p>During a twelvemonth Ali Baba forbore
to go near the forest, but at length
his curiosity incited him to make another
journey.</p>

<p>When he came to the cave he saw no
footsteps of either men or horses; and
having said, "Open Sesame," he went
in, and judged by the state of things
deposited in the cavern that no one
had been there since the pretended Cogia
Hassan had removed the merchandise
to his shop in the city. Ali Baba took
as much gold home as his horse could
carry.</p>

<p>Afterwards he carried his son to the
cave and taught him the secret. This
secret they handed down to their posterity;
and using their good fortune with
moderation, they lived in honor and
splendor, and served with dignity some
of the chief offices in the city.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class="hang1">A quaint and interesting cycle of animal
stories was formed in the Middle Ages with
the fox, called Reynard, as the hero or central
character. Their origin was not different
from that of the cycles that grew up
concerning such popular heroes as King
Arthur, Robin Hood, Charlemagne, and
Siegfried; but one difference at least may
be observed&mdash;Reynard is always represented
as evil, though clever and successful.
These stories of Reynard have furnished
material for many workers in the field of
literature and they have generally served
as a vehicle for satire. Indeed, there was
much satire in the original versions of the
folk. Perhaps the greatest of these modern
recensions is that of the German poet
Goethe. The best version for use with
children is that made by Sir Henry Cole
("Felix Summerley") and edited more
recently by Joseph Jacobs in his usual
masterly fashion. The introduction to this
edition gives just the facts that the reader
needs for understanding the significance of
the Reynard cycle.</div>

<div class="hang1">It may be noted that King Lion, after hearing
many complaints about Reynard's evil
ways, decides to bring him to court for
trial. The first special constable sent to
summon Reynard was Bruin the Bear, and
now we are to learn&mdash;</div>


<h4><br />HOW BRUIN THE BEAR SPED
WITH REYNARD THE FOX</h4>

<p>The next morning away went <i>Bruin</i>
the bear in quest of the fox, armed against
all plots of deceit whatsoever. And as
he came through a dark forest, in which
<i>Reynard</i> had a bypath, which he used
when he was hunted, he saw a high
mountain, over which he must pass to
go to <i>Malepardus</i>. For though <i>Reynard</i>
has many houses, yet <i>Malepardus</i> is
his chiefest and most ancient castle, and
in it he lay both for defense and ease.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
Now at last when <i>Bruin</i> was come to
<i>Malepardus</i>, he found the gates close
shut, at which after he had knocked,
sitting on his tail, he called aloud, "Sir
<i>Reynard</i>, are you at home? I am <i>Bruin</i>
your kinsman, whom the King hath sent
to summon you to the court, to answer
many foul accusations exhibited against
you, and hath taken a great vow, that
if you fail to appear to this summons,
your life shall answer your contempt, and
your goods and honors shall lie confiscate
at his highness's mercy. Therefore, fair
kinsman, be advised of your friend, and
go with me to the court to shun the
danger that else will fall upon you."</p>

<p><i>Reynard</i>, lying close by the gate, as
his custom was for the warm sun's sake,
hearing those words, departed into one
of his holes, for <i>Malepardus</i> is full of
many intricate and curious rooms, which
labyrinth-wise he could pass through,
when either his danger or the benefit of
any prey required the same. There he
meditated awhile with himself how he
might counterplot and bring the bear
to disgrace (who he knew loved him
not) and himself to honor; at last he
came forth, and said, "Dear uncle <i>Bruin</i>,
you are exceeding welcome. Pardon my
slowness in coming, for at your first
speech I was saying my even song, and
devotion must not be neglected. Believe
me, he hath done you no good service,
nor do I thank him which hath sent you
this weary and long journey, in which
your much sweat and toil far exceeds
the worth of the labor. Certainly had
you not come, I had to-morrow been at
the court of my own accord, yet at this
time my sorrow is much lessened, inasmuch
as your counsel at this present
may return me double benefit. Alas,
cousin, could his Majesty find no meaner
a messenger than your noble self to
employ in these trivial affairs? Truly
it appears strange to me, especially
since, next his royal self, you are of
greatest renown both in blood and riches.
For my part, I would we were both at
court, for I fear our journey will be
exceeding troublesome. To speak truth,
since I made mine abstinence from flesh,
I have eaten such strange new meats,
that my body is very much distempered,
and swelleth as if it would break."</p>

<p>"Alas, dear cousin," said the bear,
"what meat is that which maketh you
so ill?"</p>

<p>"Uncle," answered he, "what will it
profit you to know? The meat was
simple and mean. We poor men are
no lords, you know, but eat that for
necessity which others eat for wantonness;
yet not to delay you, that which
I ate was honeycombs, great, full, and
most pleasant, which, compelled by hunger,
I ate too unmeasurably and am
thereby infinitely distempered."</p>

<p>"Ha," quoth <i>Bruin</i>, "honeycombs?
Do you make such slight respect of
them, nephew? Why it is meat for the
greatest emperor in the world. Fair
nephew, help me but to some of that
honey, and command me whilst I live;
for one little part thereof I will be your
servant everlastingly."</p>

<p>"Sure," said the fox, "uncle, you but
jest with me."</p>

<p>"But jest with you?" replied <i>Bruin</i>,
"beshrew my heart then, for I am in
that serious earnest, that for one lick
thereat you shall make me the faithfullest
of all your kindred."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the fox, "if you be in
earnest, then know I will bring you
where so much is, that ten of you shall
not be able to devour it at a meal, only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
for your love's sake, which above all
things I desire, uncle."</p>

<p>"Not ten of us?" said the bear, "it is
impossible; for had I all the honey
betwixt <i>Hybla</i> and <i>Portugal</i>, yet I could
in a short space eat it all myself."</p>

<p>"Then know, uncle," quoth the fox,
"that near at hand here dwelleth a husbandman
named <i>Lanfert</i>, who is master
of so much honey that you cannot consume
it in seven years, which for your
love and friendship's sake I will put
into your safe possession."</p>

<p><i>Bruin</i>, mad upon the honey, swore,
that to have one good meal thereof he
would not only be his faithful friend, but
also stop the mouths of all his adversaries.</p>

<p><i>Reynard</i>, smiling at his easy belief,
said, "If you will have seven ton, uncle,
you shall have it."</p>

<p>These words pleased the bear so well,
and made him so pleasant, that he could
not stand for laughing.</p>

<p>Well, thought the fox, this is good
fortune. Sure I will lead him where he
shall laugh more measurably; and then
said, "Uncle, we must delay no time, and
I will spare no pains for your sake, which
for none of my kin I would perform."</p>

<p>The bear gave him many thanks, and
so away they went, the fox promising
him as much honey as he could bear,
but meant as many strokes as he could
undergo. In the end they came to
<i>Lanfert's</i> house, the sight whereof made
the bear rejoice. This <i>Lanfert</i> was a
stout and lusty carpenter, who the other
day had brought into his yard a great
oak, which, as their manner is, he began
to cleave, and had struck into it two
wedges in such wise that the cleft stood
a great way open, at which the fox
rejoiced much, for it was answerable to
his wish. So with a laughing countenance
he said to the bear, "Behold now,
dear uncle, and be careful of yourself, for
within this tree is so much honey that
it is unmeasurable. Try if you can get
into it; yet, good uncle, eat moderately,
for albeit the combs are sweet and good,
yet a surfeit is dangerous, and may be
troublesome to your body, which I
would not for a world, since no harm can
come to you but must be my dishonor."</p>

<p>"Sorrow not for me, nephew <i>Reynard</i>,"
said the bear, "nor think me such a fool
that I cannot temper mine appetite."</p>

<p>"It is true, my best uncle, I was too
bold. I pray you enter in at the end,
and you shall find your desire."</p>

<p>The bear with all haste entered the
tree, with his two feet forward, and
thrust his head into the cleft, quite
over the ears, which when the fox perceived,
he instantly ran and pulled the
wedges out of the tree, so that he locked
the bear fast therein, and then neither
flattery nor anger availed the bear. For
the nephew had by his deceit brought
the uncle into so false a prison that it
was impossible by any art to free himself
of the same. Alas, what profited
now his great strength and valor? Why,
they were both causes of more vexation;
and finding himself destitute of all relief,
he began to howl and bray, and with
scratching and tumbling to make such
a noise that <i>Lanfert</i>, amazed, came hastily
out of his house, having in his hand
a sharp hook, whilst the bear lay wallowing
and roaring within the tree.</p>

<p>The fox from afar off said to the bear
in scorn and mocking, "Is the honey
good, uncle, which you eat? How do
you? Eat not too much, I beseech you.
Pleasant things are apt to surfeit, and
you may hinder your journey to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
court. When <i>Lanfert</i> cometh (if your
belly be full) he will give you drink to
digest it, and wash it down your throat."</p>

<p>And having thus said, he went towards
his castle. But by this time, <i>Lanfert</i>,
finding the bear fast taken in the tree,
he ran to his neighbors and desired
them to come into his yard, for there
was a bear fast taken there. This was
noised through all the town, so that there
was neither man, nor woman, nor child
but ran thither, some with one weapon,
and some with another&mdash;as goads, rakes,
broom-staves, or what they could gather
up. The priest had the handle of the
cross, the clerk the holy water sprinkler,
and the priest's wife, Dame <i>Jullock</i>, with
her distaff, for she was then spinning;
nay, the old beldames came that had
ne'er a tooth in their heads. This army
put <i>Bruin</i> into a great fear, being none
but himself to withstand them, and
hearing the clamor of the noise which
came thundering upon him, he wrestled
and pulled so extremely that he got out
his head, but he left behind him all the
skin, and his ears also; insomuch that
never creature beheld a fouler or more
deformed beast. For the blood covering
all his face, and his hands leaving the
claws and skin behind them, nothing
remained but ugliness. It was an ill
market the bear came to, for he lost
both motion and sight&mdash;that is, feet
and eyes. But notwithstanding this
torment, <i>Lanfert</i>, the priest, and the
whole parish came upon him, and so
becudgeled him about his body part,
that it might well be a warning to all
his misery, to know that ever the weakest
shall still go most to the wall. This
the bear found by experience, for every
one exercised the height of their fury
upon him. Even <i>Houghlin</i> with the
crooked leg, and <i>Ludolf</i> with the long
broad nose, the one with a leaden mall,
and the other with an iron whip, all
belashed poor sir <i>Bruin;</i> not so much
but sir <i>Bertolf</i> with the long fingers,
<i>Lanfert</i> and <i>Ortam</i> did him more annoyance
than all the rest, the one having a
sharp Welsh hook, the other a crooked
staff well leaded at the end, which he
used to play at stab ball withal. There
was <i>Birkin</i> and <i>Armes Ablequack</i>, <i>Bane</i>
the priest with his staff, and Dame <i>Jullock</i>
his wife; all these so belabored the
bear, that his life was in great danger.
The poor bear in this massacre sat and
sighed extremely, groaning under the
burden of their strokes, of which <i>Lanfert's</i>
were the greatest and thundered
most dreadfully; for Dame <i>Podge</i> of
<i>Casport</i> was his mother, and his father
was <i>Marob</i> the steeple-maker, a passing
stout man when he was alone. <i>Bruin</i>
received of him many showers of stones
till <i>Lanfert's</i> brother, rushing before the
rest with a staff, struck the bear in the
head such a blow that he could neither
hear nor see, so that awaking from his
astonishment the bear leaped into the
river adjoining, through a cluster of
wives there standing together, of which
he threw divers into the water, which
was large and deep, amongst whom the
parson's wife was one; which the parson
seeing how she floated like a sea-mew, he
left striking the bear, and cried to the
rest of the company, "Help! oh, help!
Dame <i>Jullock</i> is in the water; help,
both men and women, for whosoever
saves her, I give free pardon of all their
sins and transgressions, and remit all penance
imposed whatsoever." This heard,
every one left the bear to help Dame
<i>Jullock</i>, which as soon as the bear saw,
he cut the stream and swam away as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
fast as he could, but the priest with a
great noise pursued him, crying in his
rage, "Turn, villain, that I may be
revenged of thee"; but the bear swam
in the strength of the stream and suspected
not his calling, for he was proud
that he was so escaped from them. Only
he bitterly cursed the honey tree and
the fox, which had not only betrayed
him, but had made him lose his hood
from his face, and his gloves from his
fingers. In this sort he swam some
three miles down the water, in which
time he grew so weary that he went
on land to get ease, where blood trickled
down his face; he groaned, sighed, and
drew his breath so short, as if his last
hour had been expiring.</p>

<p>Now whilst these things were in doing,
the fox in his way home stole a fat hen,
and threw her into his mail, and running
through a bypath that no man might
perceive him, he came towards the river
with infinite joy; for he suspected that
the bear was certainly slain: therefore
he said to himself, "My fortune is as I
wished it, for the greatest enemy I had
in the court is now dead, nor can any
man suspect me guilty thereof." But as
he spake these words, looking towards
the river, he espied where <i>Bruin</i> the
bear lay and rested, which struck his
heart with grief, and he railed against
<i>Lanfert</i> the carpenter, saying, "Silly
fool that thou art, what madman would
have lost such good venison, especially
being so fat and wholesome, and for
which he took no pains, for he was taken
to his hand; any man would have been
proud of the fortune which thou neglectest."
Thus fretting and chiding, he
came to the river, where he found the
bear all wounded and bloody, of which
<i>Reynard</i> was only guilty; yet in scorn
he said to the bear, "<i>Monsieur, Dieu
vous garde</i>."</p>

<p>"O thou foul red villain," said the
bear to himself, "what impudence is like
to this?"</p>

<p>But the fox went on with his speech,
and said, "What, uncle? Have you
forgot anything at <i>Lanfert's</i>, or have
you paid him for the honeycombs you
stole? If you have not, it will redound
much to your disgrace, which before
you shall undergo, I will pay him for
them myself. Sure the honey was excellent
good, and I know much more of
the same price. Good uncle, tell me
before I go, into what order do you
mean to enter, that you wear this new-fashioned
hood? Will you be a monk,
an abbot, or a friar? Surely he that
shaved your crown hath cropped your
ears; also your foretop is lost, and your
gloves are gone; fie, sloven, go not bare-handed;
they say you can sing <i>peccavi</i>
rarely."</p>

<p>These taunts made <i>Bruin</i> mad with
rage, but because he could not take
revenge, he was content to let him talk
his pleasure. Then after a small rest
he plunged again into the river, and
swam down the stream, and landed on
the other side, where he began with
much grief to meditate how he might
get to the court, for he had lost his
ears, his talons, and all the skin off his
feet, so that had a thousand deaths
followed him, he could not go. Yet of
necessity he must move, that in the end
compelled by extremity, he set his tail
on the ground, and tumbled his body
over and over; so by degrees, tumbling
now half a mile, and then half a
mile, in the end he tumbled to the
court, where divers beholding his strange
manner of approach, they thought some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
prodigy had come towards them; but in
the end the King knew him, and grew
angry, saying, "It is sir <i>Bruin</i>, my
servant; what villains have wounded
him thus, or where hath he been that
he brings his death thus along with
him?"</p>

<p>"O my dread Sovereign Lord the
King," cried out the bear, "I complain
me grievously unto you; behold how
I am massacred, which I humbly beseech
you revenge on that false <i>Reynard</i>, who,
for doing your royal pleasure, hath
brought me to this disgrace and
slaughter."</p>

<p>Then said the King, "How durst he
do this? Now by my crown I swear
I will take the revenge which shall make
the traitors tremble!"</p>

<p>Whereupon the King sent for all his
council, and consulted how and in what
sort to persecute against the fox, where
it was generally concluded that he should
be again summoned to appear and
answer his trespasses; and the party
to summon him they appointed to be
<i>Tibert</i> the cat, as well for his gravity
as wisdom; all which pleased the King
well.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_400" id="Note_400">400</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">After many ups and downs in fortune Reynard
is finally on good terms with the king when
Isegrim the Wolf appears with another
accusation. Reynard's denial of the
charges led the Wolf to challenge him to
mortal combat, a well known medieval way
of settling the truth of conflicting evidence.
The result appears in the following:</div>


<h4><br />THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE
FOX AND THE WOLF</h4>

<p>The fox answered not a word, but bowing
himself down humbly to the earth,
both before the King and the Queen's
Majesties, went forth into the field; and
at the same time the wolf was also ready,
and stood boasting, and giving out many
proud and vainglorious speeches. The
marshals and rulers of the lists were the
leopard and the loss. These brought
forth a book, on which the wolf swore and
maintained his assertion that the fox
was a traitor and a murderer, which he
would prove on his body, or else be
counted a recreant. Then <i>Reynard</i> took
the book, and swore he lied as a false
traitor and a thief, which he would prove
on his body, or be accounted a recreant.</p>

<p>When these ceremonies were done, the
marshals of the field bade them do their
devoir. And then every creature avoided
the lists, save Dame <i>Rukenaw</i>, who stood
by the fox, and bade him remember the
words and instructions she had given
him, and call to mind how, when he was
scarce seven years old, he had then wisdom
enough to pass the darkest night
without lantern or candle-light, or the
help of the moon, when any occasion
required him; and that his experience
was much greater, and his reputation of
wisdom more frequent with his companions;
and therefore to work so as he
might win the day, which would be an
eternal monument to him and his family
for ever.</p>

<p>To this the fox answered, "My best
aunt, assure yourself I will do my best,
and not forget a tittle of your counsel.
I doubt not but my friends shall
reap honor and my foes shame by my
actions." To this the ape said amen,
and so departed.</p>

<p>When none but the combatants were
in the lists, the wolf went toward the fox
with infinite rage and fury, and thinking
to take the fox in his forefeet, the fox<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
leaped nimbly from him and the wolf
pursued him, so that there began a tedious
chase between them, on which their
friends gazed. The wolf taking larger
strides than the fox often overtook him,
and lifting up his feet to strike him, the
fox avoided the blow and smote him on
the face with his tail, so that the wolf was
stricken almost blind, and he was forced
to rest while he cleared his eyes; which
advantage when <i>Reynard</i> saw, he
scratched up the dust with his feet, and
threw it in the eyes of the wolf.</p>

<p>This grieved him worse than the
former, so that he durst follow him no
longer, for the dust and sand sticking in
his eyes smarted so sore, that of force he
must rub and wash it away, which <i>Reynard</i>
seeing, with all the fury he had he
ran upon him, and with his teeth gave
him three sore wounds on his head, and
scoffing said, "Have I hit you, Mr.
Wolf? I will yet hit you better; you have
killed many a lamb and many an innocent
beast, and would impose the fault upon
me, but you shall find the price of your
knavery. I am marked to punish thy
sins, and I will give thee thy absolution
bravely. It is good for thee that thou
use patience, for thy evil life is at my
mercy. Yet, notwithstanding, if thou
wilt kneel down and ask my forgiveness,
and confess thyself vanquished, though
thou be the worst thing living, yet I will
spare thy life, for my pity makes me loath
to kill thee."</p>

<p>These words made <i>Isegrim</i> both mad
and desperate, so that he knew not how
to express his fury; his wounds bled, his
eyes smarted, and his whole body was
oppressed. So that in the height of his
fury he lifted up his foot and struck the
fox so great a blow that he felled him to
the ground. But <i>Reynard</i>, being nimble,
quickly rose up again and encountered
the wolf, that between them began a
dreadful and doubtful combat.</p>

<p>The wolf was exceeding furious, and
ten times he leaped to catch <i>Reynard</i>
fast, but his skin was so slippery and oily
he could not hold him. Nay, so wondrous
nimble was he in the fight, that
when the wolf thought to have him
surest, he would shift himself between
his legs and under his belly, and every
time gave the wolf a bite with his teeth,
or a slap on the face with his tail, that
the poor wolf found nothing but despair
in the conflict, albeit his strength was
much the greater.</p>

<p>Thus many wounds and bitings passing
on either side, the one expressing cunning,
and the other strength; the one fury, the
other temperance. In the end the wolf
being enraged that the battle had continued
so long, for had his feet been sound
it had been much shorter, he said to himself,
"I will make an end of this combat,
for I know my very weight is able to
crush him to pieces; and I lose much of
my reputation, to suffer him thus long
to contend against me."</p>

<p>And this said, he struck the fox again
so sore a blow on the head with his foot,
that he fell down to the ground, and ere
he could recover himself and arise, he
caught him in his feet and threw him
under him, lying upon him in such wise,
as if he would have pressed him to
death.</p>

<p>Now began the fox to be grievously
afraid, and all his friends also, and all
<i>Isegrim's</i> friends began to shout for joy;
but the fox defended himself as well as
he could with his claws, lying along, and
the wolf could not hurt him with his
claws, his feet were so sore; only with his
teeth he snatched at him to bite him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
which, when the fox saw, he smote the
wolf on the head with his fore-claws, so
that he tore the skin between his brows
and his ears, and one of his eyes hung out
of his head, which put the wolf to infinite
torment, and he howled out extremely.
Then <i>Isegrim</i> wiping his face, the fox
took advantage thereof, and with his
struggling got upon his feet.</p>

<p>At which the wolf was angry, and striking
after him, caught the fox in his arms,
and held him fast; never was <i>Reynard</i> in
so great a strait as then, for at that time
great was their contention; but anger now
made the wolf forget his smart, and gripping
the fox altogether under him, as
<i>Reynard</i> was defending himself his hand
lighted into <i>Isegrim's</i> mouth, so that he
was in danger of losing it. Then said
the wolf to the fox, "Now either yield
thyself as vanquished, or else certainly I
will kill thee; neither thy dust, thy mocks,
nor any subtle invention shall now save
thee; thou art now left utterly desperate,
and my wounds must have their satisfaction."</p>

<p>When the fox heard this he thought it
was a hard election, for both brought his
ruin; and suddenly concluding, he said,
"Dear uncle, since fortune commands
me, I yield to be your servant, and at
your commandments will travel for you
to the Holy Land, or any other pilgrimage,
or do any service which shall be
beneficial to your soul or the souls of your
forefathers. I will do for the King or for
our holy father the Pope, I will hold of
you my lands and revenues, and as I,
so shall all the rest of my kindred; so that
you shall be a lord of many lords, and
none shall dare to move against you.</p>

<p>"Besides, whatsoever I get of pullets,
geese, partridges, or clover, flesh or fish,
you, your wife, and children shall have
the first choice, ere any are eaten by me.
I will ever stand by your side, and wheresoever
you go, no danger shall come near
you; you are strong, and I am subtle;
we two joined together, what force can
prevail against us? Again, we are so
near in blood that nature forbids there
should be any enmity between us; I
would not have fought against you had
I been sure of victory, but that you first
appealed me, and then you know of
necessity I must do my uttermost. I
have also in this battle been courteous to
you, and not shown my worst violence,
as I would on a stranger, for I know it is
the duty of a nephew to spare his uncle;
and this you might well perceive by my
running from you. I tell you, it was an
action much contrary to my nature, for
I might often have hurt you when I
refused, nor are you worse for me by
anything more than the blemish of your
eye, for which I am sorry, and wished it
had not happened; yet thereby know that
you shall reap rather benefit than loss
thereby, for when other beasts in their
sleep shut two windows, you shall shut
but one.</p>

<p>"As for my wife, children, and lineage,
they shall fall down at your feet before
you in any presence; therefore, I humbly
desire you, that you will suffer poor <i>Reynard</i>
to live. I know you will kill me,
but what will that avail you, when you
shall never live in safety for fear of
revengement of my kindred? Therefore,
temperance in any man's wrath is excellent,
whereas rashness is ever the mother
of repentance. But, uncle, I know you
to be valiant, wise, and discreet, and you
rather seek honor, peace, and good fame
than blood and revenge."</p>

<p><i>Isegrim</i> the wolf said, "Infinite dissembler,
how fain wouldst thou be freed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
of my servitude? Too well I understand
thee, and know that if thou wert safe on
thy feet thou wouldst forswear this submission;
but know all the wealth in the
world shall not buy out thy ransom, for
thee and thy friends I esteem them not,
nor believe anything thou hast uttered.
Too well I know thee, and am no bird for
thy lime bush; chaff cannot deceive me.
Oh, how wouldst thou triumph if I should
believe thee, and say I wanted wit to
understand thee; but thou shalt know I
can look both on this side and beyond
thee. Thy many deceits used upon me
have now armed me against thee. Thou
sayest thou hast spared me in the battle;
but look upon me, and my wounds will
show how falsely thou liest; thou never
gavest me a time to breathe in, nor will
I now give thee a minute to repent in."</p>

<p>Now whilst <i>Isegrim</i> was thus talking,
the fox bethought himself how he might
best get free, and thrusting his other hand
down he caught the wolf fast by the
neck, and he wrung him so extremely
hard thereby, that he made him shriek
and howl out with the anguish; then the
fox drew his other hand out of his mouth,
for the wolf was in such wondrous torment
that he had much ado to contain
himself from swooning; for this torment
exceeded above the pain of his eye, and
in the end he fell over and over in a swoon;
then presently <i>Reynard</i> leaped upon him,
and drew him about the lists and dragged
him by the legs, and struck, wounded,
and bit him in many places, so that all
the whole field might take notice thereof.</p>

<p>At this, all <i>Isegrim's</i> friends were full
of sorrow, and with great weeping and
lamentation went to the King and prayed
him to be pleased to appease the combat
and take it into his own hands; which
suit the King granted, and then the
leopard and the loss, being marshals,
entered the lists and told the fox and the
wolf that the King would speak with
them, and that the battle should there
end, for he would take it into his own
hands and determine thereof; as for
themselves they had done sufficiently,
neither would the King lose either of
them. And to the fox they said the whole
field gave him the victory.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class="hang1">The greatest and most inspiring cycle of
medieval romances is that concerned with
the adventures of King Arthur and his
Knights of the Round Table. Developing
largely as separate stories, these romances
were brought together into an organic
collection by Sir Thomas Malory in the
third quarter of the fifteenth century.
This work, called <i>Le Morte D'Arthur</i>, has
remained the standard Arthuriad and is
the source of most modern versions. It
is one of the great monuments of English
prose, and, while at first the strangeness of
its style may repel, the wonderful dignity
of the story and the sonorous quality of
the language make a strong appeal to children
as well as to older readers. Teachers
should at least be acquainted with a portion
of Malory, and the three selections
following are taken from his text. No. <a href="#Note_404">404</a>
is added as a suggestion as to how this
material may be worked up to tell to
children.</div>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_401" id="Note_401">401</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">According to a tradition in <i>Le Morte D'Arthur</i>,
Uther Pendragon, the father of Arthur, was
a powerful king in England. To fulfill a
promise made to Merlin, Uther Pendragon
allowed Merlin to take Arthur on the day
of his birth, that the child might not be
known as the son of the king. Merlin
took the child to Sir Ector, and the wife of
Sir Ector reared Arthur as one of her own
children. The following story is an account
of how Arthur learned of his parentage.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span></p>


<h4><br />HOW ARTHUR BECAME KING</h4>

<div class='center'>SIR THOMAS MALORY</div>

<p>After the death of Uther Pendragon,
stood the realm in great jeopardy long
while, for every lord that was mighty of
men made him strong, and many weened
to have been king. Then Merlin went
to the Archbishop of Canterbury and
counselled him to send for all the lords
of the realm and all the gentlemen of
arms, that they should to London come
by Christmas.</p>

<p>So the Archbishop, by the advice of
Merlin, sent for all the lords and gentlemen
of arms that they should come by
Christmas even unto London. So in
the greatest church of London, whether
it were Paul's or not the French book
maketh no mention, all the estates were
long or day in the church for to pray.
And when matins and the first mass were
done, there was seen in the churchyard,
against the high altar, a great stone
four square, like unto a marble stone,
and in midst thereof was like an anvil
of steel a foot on high, and therein stuck
a fair sword, and letters there were
written in gold about the sword that
said thus:</p>

<div class="center">"Whoso pulleth out this sword of<br />
this stone and anvil, is rightwise<br />
king born of all England."</div>

<p>Then the people marveled and told
it to the Archbishop. "I command,"
said the Archbishop, "that you keep
you within your church, and pray unto
God still; that no man touch the sword
till the high mass be all done."</p>

<p>So when all masses were done, all the
lords went to behold the stone and the
sword. And when they saw the scripture,
some assayed; such as would have
been king. But none might stir the
sword nor move it. "He is not here,"
said the Archbishop, "that shall achieve
the sword, but doubt not God will make
him known. But this is my counsel,"
said the Archbishop, "that we provide
ten knights, men of good fame, and they
to keep this sword."</p>

<p>So it was ordained, and there was made
a cry, that every man should essay that
would, for to win the sword. And upon
New Year's Day the barons let make a
jousts and a tournament, that all knights
that would joust or tourney there might
play, and all this was ordained for to
keep the lords and the commons together,
for the Archbishop trusted that God
would make him known that should win
the sword. So upon New Year's Day,
when the service was done, the barons
rode unto the field, some to joust and
some to tourney, and so it happened that
Sir Ector rode unto the jousts, and with
him rode Sir Kay his son, and young
Arthur that was his nourished brother;
and Sir Kay had been made knight at
All Hallowmass afore.</p>

<p>So as they rode to the joustsward,
Sir Kay had lost his sword, for he had
left it at his father's lodging, and so he
prayed young Arthur for to ride for his
sword. "I will well," said Arthur, and
rode fast after the sword, and when he
came home, the lady and all were out
to see the jousting. Then was Arthur
wroth, and said to himself, "I will ride
to the churchyard and take the sword
with me that sticketh in the stone, for
my brother Sir Kay shall not be without
a sword this day." So when he came to
the churchyard, Sir Arthur alit and tied
his horse to the stile, and so he went to
the tent and found no knights there, for
they were at jousting; and so he handled
the sword by the handles, and lightly
and fiercely pulled it out of the stone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
and took his horse and rode his way
until he came to his brother Sir Kay,
and delivered him the sword.</p>

<p>As soon as Sir Kay saw the sword, he
wist well it was the sword of the stone,
and so he rode to his father, Sir Ector,
and said, "Sir, lo here is the sword of
the stone, wherefore I must be king of
this land."</p>

<p>When Sir Ector beheld the sword, he
returned again and came to the church,
and there they alit, all three, and went into
the church. And anon he made Sir Kay
to swear upon a book how he came to
that sword. "Sir," said Sir Kay, "by my
brother Arthur, for he brought it to me."</p>

<p>"How gat ye this sword?" said Sir
Ector to Arthur.</p>

<p>"Sir, I will tell you. When I came
home for my brother's sword, I found
nobody at home to deliver me his sword,
and so I thought my brother Sir Kay
should not be swordless, and so I came
hither eagerly and pulled it out of the
stone without any pain."</p>

<p>"Found ye any knights about this
sword?" said Sir Ector.</p>

<p>"Nay," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"Now," said Sir Ector to Arthur, "I
understand ye must be king of this land."</p>

<p>"Wherefore I," said Arthur, "and for
what cause?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Ector, "for God will have
it so, for there should never man have
drawn out this sword, but he that shall
be rightways king of this land. Now let
me see whether ye can put the sword
there as it was and pull it out again."</p>

<p>"That is no mastery," said Arthur,
and so he put it in the stone; therewithal
Sir Ector essayed to pull out the
sword and failed.</p>

<p>"Now essay," said Sir Ector unto
Sir Kay. And anon he pulled at the
sword with all his might, but it would
not be.</p>

<p>"Now shall ye essay," said Ector to
Arthur.</p>

<p>"I will well," said Arthur, and pulled
it out easily. And therewithal Sir Ector
knelt down to the earth, and Sir Kay.
"Alas," said Arthur, "my own dear
father and brother, why kneel ye to me?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, my lord Arthur, it is not
so. I was never your father nor of your
blood, but I wot well ye are of an higher
blood than I weened ye were." And
then Sir Ector told him all, how he had
taken him for to nourish him, and by
whose commandment, and by Merlin's
deliverance. Then Arthur made great
doole when he understood that Sir
Ector was not his father.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Ector unto Arthur, "will
ye be my good and gracious lord when
ye are king?"</p>

<p>"Else were I to blame," said Arthur,
"for ye are the man in the world that I
am most beholden to, and my good lady
and mother your wife, that as well as
her own hath fostered me and kept.
And if ever it be God's will that I be
king as ye say, God forbid that I should
fail you."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Sir Ector, "I will ask no
more of you but that ye will make my
son, your foster brother, Sir Kay,
seneschal of all your lands."</p>

<p>"That shall be done," said Arthur,
"and more, by the faith of my body,
that never man shall have that office
but he, while he and I live."</p>

<p>Therewithal they went unto the Archbishop
and told him how the sword was
achieved, and by whom; and on the
Twelfth-day all the barons came thither,
and to essay to take the sword, who that
would essay. But there afore them all,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
there might none take it out but Arthur;
wherefore there were many lords wroth,
and said it was great shame unto them
all and the realm to be over-governed
with a boy of no high blood born, and so
they fell out at that time that it was put
off until Candlemas, and then all the
barons should meet there again; but
always the ten knights were ordained
to watch the sword day and night, and
so they set a pavilion over the stone
and the sword, and five always watched.
So at Candlemas many more great lords
came thither for to have won the sword,
but there might none prevail. And
right as Arthur did at Christmas, he
did at Candlemas, and pulled out the
sword easily, whereof the barons were
sore agrieved and put it off in delay till
the high feast of Easter, yet there were
some of the great lords had indignation
that Arthur should be king, and put it
off in a delay till the feast of Pentecost.
And at the feast of Pentecost all manner
of men essayed to pull at the sword that
would essay, but none might prevail
but Arthur, and he pulled it out afore
all the lords and commons that were
there, wherefore all the commons cried
at once, "We will have Arthur unto our
king. We will put him no more in delay,
for we all see that it is God's will that
he shall be our king, and who that
holdeth against it, we will slay him."
And therewith they all kneeled at once,
both rich and poor, and cried Arthur
mercy because they had delayed him so
long, and Arthur forgave them, and took
the sword between both his hands, and
offered it upon the altar where the
Archbishop was, and so was he made
knight of the best man that was there.
And so anon was the coronation made.
And there was he sworn unto his lords
and the commons for to be a true king
and to stand with true justice from
thenceforth the days of his life.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_402" id="Note_402">402</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">After Arthur was made king, he spent several
years in war with his lawless barons before
he finally established a stable government
in England. Malory's accounts of these
wars are interspersed with stories of
miraculous incidents, accounts of the
adventures of knights, and descriptions of
feasts, tournaments, and jousts. The following
is a description of the jousting
between the knights of King Arthur and
those of two French kings, Ban and Bors,
who had come to aid Arthur in his wars.</div>


<h4><br />A TOURNEY WITH THE FRENCH</h4>

<div class='center'>SIR THOMAS MALORY</div>

<p>Then the king let purvey for a great
feast, and let cry a great jousts. And
by All Hallowmass the two kings were
come over the sea with three hundred
knights well arrayed both for peace and
for war. And King Arthur met with
them ten miles out of London, and there
was great joy as could be thought or
made. And on All Hallowmass at the
great feast, sat in the hall the three
kings, and Sir Kay seneschal served in
the hall, and Sir Lucas the butler, and
Sir Griflet. These three knights had
the rule of all the service that served the
kings. And anon, as they had washed
and risen, all knights that would joust
made them ready. By when they were
ready on horseback there were seven
hundred knights. And Arthur, Ban, and
Bors, with the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and Sir Ector, Kay's father, they
were in a place covered with cloth of
gold like an hall, with ladies and gentlewomen,
for to behold who did the best,
and thereon to give judgment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span></p>

<p>And King Arthur and the two kings
let depart the seven hundred knights
into two parties. And there were three
hundred knights of the realm of Benwick
and of Gaul turned on the other side.
Then they dressed their shields, and
began to couch their spears many good
knights. So Griflet was the first that
met with a knight, one Ladinas, and
they met so eagerly that all men had
wonder; and they so fought that their
shields fell to pieces, and horse and man
fell to the earth; and both French knight
and English knight lay so long that all
men weened they had been dead. When
Lucas the butler saw Griflet so lie, he
horsed him again anon, and they two
did marvelous deeds of arms with many
bachelors. Also Sir Kay came out of
an enbushment with five knights with
him, and they six smote other six down.
But Sir Kay did that day marvelous
deeds of arms that there was none did
so well as he that day. Then there
come Ladinas and Gracian, two knights
of France, and did passing well, that all
men praised them. Then come there
Sir Placidas, a good knight, and met
with Sir Kay, and smote him down horse
and man, wherefore Sir Griflet was wroth,
and met with Sir Placidas so hard that
horse and man fell to the earth. But
when the five knights wist that Sir Kay
had a fall, they were wroth out of wit,
and therewith each of them five bare
down a knight. When King Arthur and
the two kings saw them begin to wax
wroth on both parties, they leaped on
small hackneys and let cry that all
men should depart unto their lodging.
And so they went home and unarmed
them, and so to evensong and supper.
And after, the three kings went into
a garden and gave the prize unto Sir
Kay, and to Lucas the butler, and unto
Sir Griflet.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_403" id="Note_403">403</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">One part of <i>Le Morte D'Arthur</i> will illustrate
almost as well as another the nature of
the adventure stories that grew up in
the Middle Ages regarding the traditional
heroes of chivalry. The following
selection is taken from the first part of
the book.</div>


<h4><br />ADVENTURES OF ARTHUR</h4>

<div class='center'>SIR THOMAS MALORY</div>

<p>Then on a day there came in the court
a squire on horseback, leading a knight
before him wounded to the death. He
said, "There is a knight in the forest
who hath reared up a pavilion by a well,
and hath slain my master, a good knight
whose name was Miles; wherefore I
beseech you that my master may be
buried, and that some knight may
revenge my master's death."</p>

<p>Then the noise was great of that
knight's death in the court, and every
man said his advice. Then came Griflet
that was but a squire, and he was but
young, of the age of King Arthur; so
he besought the king for all his service
that he had done him to give him the
order of knighthood.</p>

<p>"Thou art full young and tender of
age," said Arthur, "for to take so high
an order on thee."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Griflet, "I beseech you
make me knight."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Merlin, "it were great pity
to lose Griflet, for he will be a passing
good man when he is of age, abiding with
you the term of his life. And if he
adventure his body with yonder knight
at the fountain, it is in great peril if ever
he come again, for he is one of the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
knights in the world, and the strongest
man of arms."</p>

<p>"Well," said Arthur. So at the desire
of Griflet the king made him knight.
"Now," said Arthur unto Sir Griflet,
"sith I have made you knight thou must
give me a gift."</p>

<p>"What ye will," said Griflet.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt promise me by the faith
of thy body, when thou hast jousted
with the knight at the fountain, whether
it fall ye to be on foot or on horseback,
that right so ye shall come again unto
me without making any more debate."</p>

<p>"I will promise you," said Griflet,
"as you desire."</p>

<p>Then took Griflet his horse in great
haste, and dressed his shield and took a
spear in his hand, and so he rode at a
great wallop till he came to the fountain,
and thereby he saw a rich pavilion, and
thereby under a cloth stood a fair horse
well saddled and bridled, and on a tree a
shield of divers colors and a great spear.
Then Griflet smote on the shield with the
butt of his spear, that the shield fell down
to the ground. With that the knight
came out of the pavilion and said, "Fair
knight, why smote ye down my shield?"</p>

<p>"For I will joust with you," said
Griflet.</p>

<p>"It is better ye do not," said the
knight, "for ye are but young, and late
made knight, and your might is nothing
to mine."</p>

<p>"As for that," said Griflet, "I will
joust with you."</p>

<p>"That is me loath," said the knight,
"but sith I must needs, I will dress me
thereto. Of whence be ye?" said the
knight.</p>

<p>"Sir, I am of Arthur's court."</p>

<p>So the two knights ran together that
Griflet's spear all to-shivered; and therewithal
he smote Griflet through the
shield and the left side, and brake the
spear that the truncheon stuck in his
body, that horse and knight fell down.</p>

<p>When the knight saw him lie so on
the ground, he alit, and was passing
heavy, for he weened he had slain him,
and then he unlaced his helm and gat
him wind, and so with the truncheon
he set him on his horse and gat him
wind, and so betook him to God, and
said he had a mighty heart, and if he
might live he would prove a passing good
knight. And so Sir Griflet rode to the
court, where great dole was made for him.
But through good leeches he was healed
and saved.</p>

<p>Right so came into the court twelve
knights, who were aged men, and they
came from the Emperor of Rome, and
they asked of Arthur truage for this
realm, other-else the emperor would
destroy him and his land.</p>

<p>"Well," said King Arthur, "ye are
messengers, therefore ye may say what
ye will, other-else ye should die therefore.
But this is mine answer: I owe
the emperor no truage, nor none will I
hold him, but on a fair field I shall give
him my truage that shall be with a sharp
spear, or else with a sharp sword, and
that shall not be long."</p>

<p>And therewith the messengers departed
passingly wroth, and King Arthur as
wroth, for in evil time came they then;
for the king was passingly wroth for the
hurt of Sir Griflet. And so he commanded
a privy man of his chamber
that or it be day his best horse and
armor with all that longeth unto his
person, be without the city or to-morrow
day. Right so or to-morrow day he
met with his man and his horse, and so
mounted up and dressed his shield and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
took his spear, and bade his chamberlain
tarry there till he came again. And
so Arthur rode a soft pace till it was
day, and then was he ware of three
churls chasing Merlin, and would have
slain him. Then the king rode unto
them and bade them, "Flee, churls!"
Then were they afeard when they saw a
knight, and fled.</p>

<p>"O Merlin," said Arthur, "here hadst
thou been slain for all thy crafts had I
not been."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Merlin, "not so, for I
could save myself an I would; and
thou art more near thy death than I
am, for thou goest to the deathward,
an God be not thy friend."</p>

<p>So as they went thus talking they
came to the fountain and the rich pavilion
there by it. Then King Arthur was
ware where sat a knight armed in a
chair. "Sir knight," said Arthur, "for
what cause abidest thou here, that there
may no knight ride this way but he
joust with thee? I rede thee leave that
custom," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"This custom," said the knight, "have
I used and will use maugre who saith
nay, and who is grieved with my custom
let him amend it that will."</p>

<p>"I will amend it," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"I shall defend thee," said the knight.</p>

<p>Anon he took his horse and dressed
his shield and took a spear, and they met
so hard either on other's shield, that all
to-shivered their spears. Therewith anon
Arthur pulled out his sword. "Nay,
not so," said the knight; "it is fairer
that we twain run more together with
sharp spears."</p>

<p>"I will well," said Arthur, "an I had
any more spears."</p>

<p>"I have enow," said the knight, so
there came a squire and brought two
good spears, and Arthur chose one and
he another; so they spurred their horses
and came together with all their mights,
that either brake their spears to their
hands. Then Arthur set hand on his
sword. "Nay," said the knight, "ye
shall do better. Ye are a passing good
jouster as ever I met withal, and once
more for the love of the high order of
knighthood let us joust once again."</p>

<p>"I assent me," said Arthur.</p>

<p>Anon there were brought two great
spears, and every knight gat a spear,
and therewith they ran together that
Arthur's spear all to-shivered. But the
other knight hit him so hard in midst
of the shield that horse and man fell to
the earth, and therewith Arthur was
eager, and pulled out his sword and said,
"I will assay thee, sir knight, on foot,
for I have lost the honor on horseback."</p>

<p>"I will be on horseback," said the
knight.</p>

<p>Then was Arthur wroth, and dressed
his shield toward him with his sword
drawn. When the knight saw that, he
alit, for him thought no worship to have
a knight at such avail, he to be on
horseback and he on foot, and so he
alit and dressed his shield unto Arthur.
And there began a strong battle with
many great strokes, and so hewed with
their swords that the cantels flew in the
fields, and much blood they bled both,
that all the place there as they fought
was overbled with blood, and thus they
fought long and rested them, and then
they went to battle again, and so hurtled
together like two rams that either fell
to the earth. So at the last they smote
together that both their swords met
even together. But the sword of the
knight smote King Arthur's sword in
two pieces, wherefore he was heavy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
Then said the knight unto Arthur, "Thou
art in my daunger whether me list to
save thee or slay thee, and but thou
yield thee as overcome and recreant,
thou shalt die."</p>

<p>"As for death," said King Arthur,
"welcome be it when it cometh, but to
yield me unto thee as recreant I had
liefer die than be so shamed."</p>

<p>And therewithal the king leaped unto
Pellinore, and took him by the middle
and threw him down, and raised off
his helm. When the knight felt that,
he was adread, for he was a passing big
man of might, and anon he brought
Arthur under him, and raised off his
helm and would have smitten off his
head.</p>

<p>Therewithal came Merlin and said,
"Knight, hold thy hand, for an thou
slay that knight thou puttest this realm
in the greatest damage that ever was
realm; for this knight is a man of more
worship that thou wotest of."</p>

<p>"Why, who is he?" said the knight.</p>

<p>"It is King Arthur."</p>

<p>Then would he have slain him for
dread of his wrath, and heaved up his
sword, and therewith Merlin cast an
enchantment to the knight, that he fell
to the earth in a great sleep. Then
Merlin took up King Arthur, and rode
forth on the knight's horse.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Arthur, "what hast thou
done, Merlin? Hast thou slain this
good knight by thy crafts? There liveth
not so worshipful a knight as he was; I
had liefer than the stint of my land a
year that he were alive."</p>

<p>"Care ye not," said Merlin, "for he
is wholer than ye; for he is but asleep,
and will awake within three hours. I
told you," said Merlin, "what a knight
he was; here had ye been slain had I
not been. Also there liveth not a bigger
knight than he is one, and he shall hereafter
do you right good service; and his
name is Pellinore, and he shall have
two sons that shall be passing good men;
save one they shall have no fellow of
prowess and of good living, and their
names shall be Percivale of Wales and
Lamerake of Wales."</p>

<p>Right so the king and he departed
and went unto an hermit that was a
good man and a great leech. So the
hermit searched all his wounds and gave
him good salves; so the king was there
three days, and then were his wounds
well amended that he might ride and
go, and so departed.</p>

<p>And as they rode, Arthur said, "I
have no sword."</p>

<p>"No force," said Merlin, "hereby is
a sword that shall be yours, an I may."</p>

<p>So they rode till they came to a lake,
the which was a fair water and broad,
and in the midst of the lake Arthur was
ware of an arm clothed in white samite,
that held a fair sword in that hand.</p>

<p>"Lo!" said Merlin, "yonder is that
sword that I spake of."</p>

<p>With that they saw a damosel going
upon the lake. "What damosel is that?"
said Arthur.</p>

<p>"That is the Lady of the Lake," said
Merlin; "and within that lake is a rock,
and therein is as fair a place as any on
earth, and richly beseen; and this
damosel will come to you anon, and
then speak ye fair to her that she will
give you that sword."</p>

<p>Anon withal came the damosel unto
Arthur and saluted him, and he her
again. "Damosel," said Arthur, "what
sword is that, that yonder the arm
holdeth above the water? I would it
were mine, for I have no sword."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir Arthur, king," said the damosel,
"that sword is mine, and if ye will give
me a gift when I ask it you, ye shall
have it."</p>

<p>"By my faith," said Arthur, "I will
give you what gift ye will ask."</p>

<p>"Well!" said the damosel. "Go ye
into yonder barge, and row yourself to
the sword, and take it and the scabbard
with you, and I will ask my gift when
I see my time."</p>

<p>So Sir Arthur and Merlin alit and tied
their horses to two trees, and so they
went into the ship, and when they came
to the sword that the hand held, Sir
Arthur took it up by the handles, and
took it with him, and the arm and the
hand went under the water. And so
they came unto the land and rode forth,
and then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion.</p>

<p>"What signifieth yonder pavilion?"</p>

<p>"It is the knight's pavilion," said
Merlin, "that ye fought with last, Sir
Pellinore; but he is out; he is not there.
He hath ado with a knight of yours
that hight Egglame, and they have
foughten together, but at the last Egglame
fled, and else he had been dead,
and he hath chased him even to Carlion,
and we shall meet with him anon in the
highway."</p>

<p>"That is well said," said Arthur,
"now have I a sword; now will I wage
battle with him, and be avenged on
him."</p>

<p>"Sir, you shall not so," said Merlin,
"for the knight is weary of fighting and
chasing, so that ye shall have no worship
to have ado with him; also he will not
be lightly matched of one knight living,
and therefore it is my counsel, let him
pass, for he shall do you good service
in short time, and his sons after his
days. Also ye shall see that day in
short space, you shall be right glad to
give him your sister to wed."</p>

<p>"When I see him, I will do as ye
advise me," said Arthur. Then Sir
Arthur looked on the sword, and liked
it passing well.</p>

<p>"Whether liketh you the better," said
Merlin, "the sword or the scabbard?"</p>

<p>"Me liketh better the sword," said
Arthur.</p>

<p>"Ye are more unwise," said Merlin,
"for the scabbard is worth ten of the
swords, for whiles ye have the scabbard
upon you, ye shall never lose no blood
be ye never so sore wounded, therefore
keep well the scabbard always with you."</p>

<p>So they rode unto Carlion, and by the
way they met with Sir Pellinore; but
Merlin had done such a craft, that
Pellinore saw not Arthur, and he passed
by without any words.</p>

<p>"I marvel," said Arthur, "that the
knight would not speak."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Merlin, "he saw you not,
for an he had seen you, ye had not
lightly departed."</p>

<p>So they came unto Carlion, whereof
his knights were passing glad. And
when they heard of his adventures, they
marveled that he would jeopard his
person so, alone. But all men of worship
said it was merry to be under such
a chieftain, that would put his person
in adventure as other poor knights did.</p>

<p>This meanwhile came a messenger
from King Rience of North Wales, and
king he was of all Ireland, and of many
isles. And this was his message, greeting
well King Arthur in this manner wise,
saying that King Rience had discomfited
and overcome eleven kings, and every
each of them did him homage, and that
was this, they gave him their beards
clean flayed off, as much as there was;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
wherefore the messenger came for King
Arthur's beard. For King Rience had
purfled a mantle with king's beards,
and there lacked one place of the mantle;
wherefore he sent for his beard, or else
he would enter his lands, and burn and
slay, and never leave till he have the
head and the beard.</p>

<p>"Well," said Arthur, "thou hast said
thy message, the which is the most
villainous and lewdest message that ever
man heard sent unto a king; also thou
mayest see my beard is full young yet
to make a purfle of it. But tell thou
thy king this: I owe him none homage,
nor none of mine elders, but or it be
long to, he shall do me homage on both
his knees, or else he shall lose his head,
by the faith of my body, for this is the
most shamefulest message that ever I
heard speak of. I have espied thy king
met never yet with worshipful man, but
tell him I will have his head without he
do me homage." Then the messenger
departed.</p>

<p>"Now is there any here," said Arthur,
"that knoweth King Rience?"</p>

<p>Then answered a knight that hight
Naram, "Sir, I know the king well. He
is a passing good man of his body, as
few be living, and a passing proud man,
and Sir, doubt ye not he will make war
on you with a mighty puissance."</p>

<p>"Well," said Arthur, "I shall ordain
for him in short time."</p>

<h4><br />ARTHUR AND SIR ACCALON</h4>

<div class='center'>MAUDE RADFORD WARREN</div>

<p>There was a woman in Arthur's Court
named Morgan le Fay, who had learned
a great deal about magic. She was a
wicked woman, and hated the king
because he was more powerful than she,
and because he was so good.</p>

<p>However, she pretended to be a true
friend to him, and the king believed in
her. One day when they were talking
together, she asked him if he would not
let her take charge of his wonderful
sword Excalibur, and its scabbard. She
said that she would guard them so carefully
that they would never be stolen.
As she was very eager, Arthur granted
her request.</p>

<p>One day in time of peace, King Arthur
went out hunting with a certain knight
named Sir Accalon, who was the lover of
Morgan le Fay. They rode for a long
time, and when they were tired, stopped
to rest beside a great lake. As they
looked over its shining waters, they saw
a beautiful little ship, which sailed
straight towards them, and ran up to
the sands at their feet. It was all covered
with golden silks, which waved in the
gentle wind. King Arthur and Sir
Accalon climbed into it and examined
it thoroughly, but they found no one
on board.</p>

<p>They rested on two couches which
were on the deck, until it grew dark.
Then they were about to return home,
when all at once, a hundred torches set
on the sides of the ship were lighted, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
suddenly there appeared twelve beautiful
damsels who told the two that they were
welcome, and that they should be served
with a banquet.</p>

<p>Presently the maidens led the king
and the knight into a room which had a
table covered with a white cloth embroidered
in purple. It bore many golden
dishes, and each dish had a beautiful
design carved upon it. Some dishes had
vine-leaves, others ivy-leaves; some had
angels with long robes sweeping back in
graceful lines; and all these dishes held
choice food. The king and Sir Accalon
ate to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>Then the damsels led them into two
separate chambers. King Arthur was
tired and so sleepy that he gave but one
glance at his bedroom. He saw that it
was hung in red silk embroidered with
gold dragons and griffins. Then he threw
himself on his bed and slept very soundly.</p>

<p>When he awoke, he found himself not
in the pretty bed-chamber, but in a dark
place. He could see nothing, but all
about him he heard the sound of complaining
and weeping. He was much
bewildered, but in a moment he cried:</p>

<p>"What is this? Where am I?"</p>

<p>Then a voice answered:</p>

<p>"You are in prison, as we are."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>The voice replied:</p>

<p>"We are twenty knights, prisoners,
and some of us have been here as long as
seven years. We are in the dungeons of
a wicked lord named Sir Damas. He has
a younger brother, and the two brothers
are enemies, quarreling about their inheritance.
Now the younger brother, Sir
Ontzlake, is very strong, but Sir Damas is
not strong, and moreover, he is a coward.
So he tries to find a knight who will fight
for him against Sir Ontzlake.</p>

<p>"But Sir Damas is so much hated that
no one will fight for him. So he goes
about the country with a body of rough
men, and whenever he sees a knight, he
captures him. Then he asks him to fight
with Sir Ontzlake. So far, all the knights
have refused, and have been thrown into
prison. We do not have food enough, but
we would rather die here than fight for
Sir Damas, who is so wicked."</p>

<p>At that moment a damsel entered the
prison with a torch, which faintly lighted
the dismal place, and advanced to the
king.</p>

<p>"Sir," she said, "will you fight for my
lord, Sir Damas? If you will, you shall
be taken from this prison. If you will
not, you shall die here."</p>

<p>Arthur considered for some time, and
then said:</p>

<p>"I would rather fight than die in prison.
If I fight, will you deliver also all these
prisoners?"</p>

<p>The damsel promised, and Arthur consented
to fight. While she went to tell
Sir Damas, Arthur said to the other
prisoners:</p>

<p>"My friends, I do not know Sir Damas,
and I do not know Sir Ontzlake. I do
not know whether they are bad or good.
But I will fight, and then, when I have
conquered, I shall judge between them,
and do justice to both."</p>

<p>"That is a good plan," said the knights,
"but why are you so sure that you will
conquer?"</p>

<p>"I am Arthur, the King," he replied.</p>

<p>At that the knights set up a great cry
of joy, and the king continued:</p>

<p>"I shall send for my good sword Excalibur
and the scabbard, and with these I
shall surely win."</p>

<p>So when Arthur and the knights were
let out of prison, the king sent the damsel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
who had visited them to Morgan le Fay
for his sword and scabbard.</p>

<p>Meantime, the knight who had accompanied
Arthur on the little ship, Sir Accalon,
also awoke. He found himself in
the palace of Morgan le Fay, and he wondered
very much where Arthur was. He
went to the lady, who said to him:</p>

<p>"My dear lord, the day has come when
you can have great power if you want it.
Should you like to be king of this land,
instead of Arthur?"</p>

<p>Now Sir Accalon was a traitor at heart.
He wanted very much to be king, even if
the good Arthur was to be killed; so he
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, truly."</p>

<p>Then she said:</p>

<p>"You shall be king, and I shall be your
queen. All you need to do is to fight a
great battle, which you shall win. I have
been using my magic. It was I who sent
the ship of silk to you and Arthur. I
had him put into prison, and I had you
brought here."</p>

<p>Sir Accalon wondered very much.
Then she told him of the fight King
Arthur was to make against Sir Ontzlake.</p>

<p>"But I have caused Sir Ontzlake to
fall sick," she said, "and he cannot fight.
I shall go with you to his castle and you
can offer to fight for him."</p>

<p>"I to fight with the king!" cried Sir
Accalon. "He would surely overthrow
me."</p>

<p>"He cannot," said Morgan le Fay,
"because you are to fight with his sword.
A little while ago he sent to me for
Excalibur and the scabbard, but I
returned him a false sword which looks
like Excalibur, and a false scabbard.
You shall take the true ones, and then
you will surely overcome him and rule
this land."</p>

<p>Then Sir Accalon was glad, and he
hastened with the lady to the castle of
Sir Ontzlake. They found him groaning
because he was ill and because Sir Damas
had sent him a challenge to fight with a
knight, and he could not accept it. He
was much relieved when Morgan le Fay
told him that Sir Accalon would fight in
his place.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon, King Arthur
and Sir Accalon rode into the field where
the combat was to be held. Arthur did
not know who Sir Accalon was, nor did
any one else, except Morgan le Fay.
Two sides of the field were full of people,
who came to watch, half of whom were
friends of Sir Damas, and the other half
were friends of Sir Ontzlake.</p>

<p>Arthur and Sir Accalon rode at each
other so furiously that at the shock of the
meeting both fell off their horses. Then
they began to fight fiercely with their
swords. The king could make no headway
with his false steel, but whenever Sir
Accalon struck at Arthur he drew blood.</p>

<p>The king was much amazed. He grew
weaker and weaker, but still he kept on
his feet. Those who watched him were
sorry for him; they thought they had
never seen a man fight so bravely. At
last Arthur's sword broke, and fell in
two pieces on the ground. When Sir
Accalon saw this, he cried:</p>

<p>"Now, yield to me."</p>

<p>"I will never yield," said the king,
"and if you do not get me another sword,
you will be shamed before all men, for it
is an unknightly thing to fight with a
defenseless man."</p>

<p>"I do not care," said Sir Accalon. "If
you will not yield, defend yourself with
your shield as best you can."</p>

<p>He rushed at the king. Arthur was so
weak that he could hardly stand, but he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
guarded himself as well as he could with
his shield. Soon he could do no more,
and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>At this moment the Lady of the Lake,
who had given Arthur his sword, came
upon the field. She was invisible, but
anyone who had listened intently could
have heard a sound like a ripple of water
as she walked. She caused Excalibur
to fall out of the hand of Sir Accalon and
drop near Arthur.</p>

<p>When it fell, Arthur saw that it was
his own Excalibur. He grasped its
handle and some of his strength came
back. He struggled to his feet, and rushing
up to Sir Accalon, seized the scabbard
of Excalibur and threw it far over the
field.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "send for a second
sword and fight with me."</p>

<p>Then Sir Accalon was afraid. Yet he
thought that Arthur was so weak that he
could still be overcome. So he sent for
a second sword, and they began to fight
again. Arthur's strength, however, had
largely returned, and in a short time he
gave Sir Accalon a mortal stroke.</p>

<p>Sir Accalon fell to the ground, and the
king, leaning over him, cried:</p>

<p>"Tell me who you are."</p>

<p>Then Sir Accalon was filled with
remorse, and he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, my King, I have been a traitor
to you, but now I am dying, and I am
sorry for what I have done. I deserve
my death."</p>

<p>He told the king his name, and all
about his treachery, and that of Morgan
le Fay.</p>

<p>King Arthur was sad.</p>

<p>"It is very hard to be deceived in a
friend," he said, "but I forgive you
freely. I will try to cure your wound,
and sometime I shall trust you again."</p>

<p>"You cannot cure me," said Sir Accalon.
"I am dying. Let them carry me
off the field."</p>

<p>So he was taken to a neighboring
abbey, while the people crowded about
the king to congratulate him, but Arthur
said:</p>

<p>"I am sad at heart. My victory is no
comfort to me, for to-day I have lost a
friend whom I believed true."</p>

<p>Then he called the two brothers, Sir
Damas and Sir Ontzlake, and judged their
cause. He decided that their property
must be divided equally between them,
and that they must be friends. They
promised never to quarrel again. Arthur
told them that they must be kind to other
knights and to all people. He said that
if he heard that they were not, he could
come and punish them.</p>

<p>After this, Sir Damas gave back to the
twenty knights all their money, and they
went on their way rejoicing. King
Arthur mounted his horse and rode over
to the abbey, where he sat by the bed of
Sir Accalon till the poor knight died.
Then the king went back alone to his
Court at Camelot.</p>

<div class="hang1">Miguel de Cervantes, the greatest literary
genius of Spain, was born in 1547 in a small
town near Madrid, and he died in 1616, the
year of the death of Shakespeare. He
received a fair education, and by reading
he gained a thorough knowledge of the
romantic poetry of Spain and Italy and of
the romances of chivalry. At the age of
twenty-one he went to Italy. For several
years he was a soldier in the Spanish army.
When he was twenty-eight years old, he
was captured by pirates of Algiers and was
held a prisoner for five years. When he
returned to Spain, he attempted to make a
living by writing dramas and romances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
and later he secured an unimportant governmental
position as commissary and tax-collector
in Seville. In 1606 he published
the first part of <i>Don Quixote</i>. This book
immediately became very popular, but it
did not bring him much money nor did it
win for him the recognition of literary men.
All his life he was poor, and sometimes
apparently he was actually in want of food.
In 1615, one year before his death, he published
the second part of <i>Don Quixote</i>, the
greatest national book of Spain.</div>

<div class="hang1"><i>Don Quixote</i> is a humorous satire upon the
romances of chivalry, which at the time
were so popular in Spain as to corrupt the
national life by their loose morals and false
ideals. So complete was the success of
Cervantes that the whole nation began to
laugh at the absurdities of the romances of
chivalry, and it is said that not one new
edition of any book of chivalry appeared in
Spain after the publication of <i>Don Quixote</i>.</div>

<div class="hang1">Although the world no longer takes serious
consideration of the ideals of the romances
of chivalry, <i>Don Quixote</i> will always be
remembered as a great book, for it abounds
in good-humored satire of human follies
that are found in all ages and countries.
Sancho Panza represents the type of person
who does not have imagination or spiritual
ideals. Not much less ridiculous, though
much more deserving of sympathy, is Don
Quixote, who represents the type of person
who is controlled by imagination and
fanciful ideals, unbalanced by practical
judgment. The life of a person of either
type must be filled with absurdities.</div>

<div class="hang1">The following selections are taken from <i>Stories
of Don Quixote</i> retold by H. L. Havell.</div>


<h4><br />STORIES FROM DON QUIXOTE</h4>


<div class='center'><br />I. DREAMS AND SHADOWS</div>

<p>The scene is laid in a village of La
Mancha, a high and arid district of
Central Spain; and the time is towards
the close of the sixteenth century. On
the outskirts of the village there stood
at the time mentioned a house of modest
size, adjoining a little farm, the property
of a retired gentleman whose real
name was Quisada or Quijada, but who
is now known to all mankind by the
immortal title of Don Quixote. How
he came to alter his name we shall see
presently.</p>

<p>On a hot summer afternoon this worthy
gentleman was sitting in a small upper
room, which served him as a study,
absorbed in the contents of a huge folio
volume, which lay open on the table
before him. Other volumes, of like bulky
proportions, were piled up on chairs or
strewn on the floor around him. The
reader was a man some fifty years of age,
tall and spare of figure, and with high,
stern features of the severest Spanish
type. In his eyes, when from time to
time he paused in his reading and gazed
absently before him, there was a look of
wild abstraction, as of one who lives in
a world of dreams and shadows. One
hand, with bony, nervous fingers, rested
on the open page; with the other he
grasped his sword, which lay sheathed
on his lap.</p>

<p>No sound disturbs the sultry stillness
of the chamber, save only the droning of
an imprisoned bee and the rustling of
paper when the eager student turned a
leaf. Deeper and deeper grew his absorption;
his eyes seemed to devour the
lines, and he clutched his hair with both
hands, as if he would tear it out by the
roots. At last, overpowered by a frenzied
impulse, he leaped from his seat, and
plucking his sword from the scabbard,
began cutting and thrusting at some invisible
object, shouting in a voice of
thunder: "Unhand the maiden, foul
caitiff! Give place, I say, and let the
princess go! What, wilt thou face me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
vile robber? Have at thee, then, and
take the wages of thy villainy." As he
uttered the last words he aimed a tremendous
thrust at his visionary opponent
and narrowly escaped transfixing the
comely person of a young lady who at
this very moment entered the room, with
signs of haste and alarm. Behind her,
in the dimly-lighted passage, appeared
the portly figure of an elderly dame, who
was proclaimed, by the bunch of keys
which hung at her girdle, to be the
gentleman's housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Dear uncle, what ails thee?" said the
young lady, gazing with pity and wonder
at the poor distracted man, who stood
arrested in his last attitude, with rolling
eyes and hair in wild disorder, while great
beads of sweat poured down his face.
But he, whose mind was still soaring in
the regions of high romance, at once converted
his niece into a rescued princess,
saved from violence by his prowess; and,
lowering his blade and dropping gracefully
on one knee, he raised her hand to
his lips and said: "Fear nothing, gentle
lady! There lies thine enemy in his
gore"; and he pointed to a table which
had been overset in one of his wild rushes,
carrying with it an inkstand, the contents
of which were now trickling in a
black stream across the uncarpeted
boards.</p>

<p>His niece was accustomed to the
strange fits of her eccentric relative, and,
humoring his fancy, she answered:
"Thou hast done well, and I thank thee.
But sit down now and rest awhile after
thy toils; and I will bring thee something
to drink." With that she led him to a
couch and left the room, taking the housekeeper
with her. In a few moments she
returned, bearing a great pitcher of cold
water.</p>

<p>"'Tis a most rare elixir," said he, after
taking a deep draught, "prepared by the
great enchanter Alquife, and of a magic
potency." Then, being exhausted by
his violent exertions of body and mind
he stretched himself on the couch and
soon sank into a quiet sleep.</p>


<div class='center'><br />II. PREPARING FOR THE QUEST</div>

<p>The extraordinary scene which has
just been described was only one among
many which had occurred during several
months, down to the time when our
story begins; and we must now go back
a little and give some account of our
hero's habits and studies, which ended
by bringing him to so desperate a state.
At that time by far the most popular
form of light literature was the Romances
of Chivalry,&mdash;huge interminable fictions,
filled with the most extravagant visions
that ever visited the slumbers of a mad
poet. Merely to unravel the story of
one of these gigantic romances is a task
which would tax the strongest brain.
They dealt with the adventures of
Knights-Errant, who wandered about
the earth redressing grievances and
succoring the oppressed. Those who
venture into these vast jungles of romance
are occasionally rewarded by
passages of great sweetness, nobility, and
charm; but the modern reader soon
grows weary of enchanted forests, haunted
by giants, dragons, and other impossible
monsters, of deserts where despairing
lovers roam haggard and forlorn, of
dwarfs, goblins, wizards, and all the wild
and grotesque creations of the medi&aelig;val
fancy.</p>

<p>But in the times of which we are
writing the passion for Books of Chivalry
rose to such a height that it became a
serious public evil. In Spain it reached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
its climax; and our humble gentleman of
La Mancha is only an extreme example
of the effect which such studies produced
on the national mind. Being bitten by
the craze for chivalrous fiction, he gradually
forsook all the healthy pursuits of
a country life and gave himself up entirely
to reading such books as Amadis
of Gaul, Palmerin of England, and Belianis
of Greece; and his infatuation
reached such a point that he sold several
acres of good arable land to provide himself
with funds for the purchase of those
ponderous folios with which we saw him
surrounded when he was first introduced
to our notice. From dawn till eve he
pored over his darling books, and sometimes
passed whole nights in the same
pursuit, until at last, having crammed
his brain with this perilous stuff, he
began to imagine that these wild inventions
were sober reality. From this
delusion there was but one step to the
belief that he himself was a principal
actor in the adventures of which he
read; and when the fit was on him, he
would take his sword and engage in
single combat with the creatures of his
brain, stamping his feet and alarming
the household with his cries.</p>

<p>At first his frenzy was intermittent,
and each attack was followed by a lucid
interval; but finally he lost his wits
altogether and came to the insane resolution
of turning knight-errant and going
out into the world as the redresser of
wrongs and the champion of the innocent.
His intention once formed, he at
once took steps to carry it into effect.
From a dark corner of the house he
brought out an old suit of armor, which
had been lying neglected for generations
and was now covered with mould and
eaten with rust. He cleaned the pieces
and repaired them as well as he could;
and observing that the helmet was a
simple morion, wanting a protection for
the face, he made a vizor of pasteboard
to supply the defect. Then, wishing to
prove the strength of his vizor, he drew
his sword and with one stroke destroyed
what had cost him the labor of a week.
He was considerably shocked by the
ease with which he had demolished his
handiwork; but having made a second
vizor and strengthened it with bars of
iron, he did not choose to try any further
experiments, but accepted the helmet,
thus fortified, as the finest headpiece in
the world.</p>

<p>Then he paid a visit to his old horse,
and though the poor beast was a mere
living skeleton, broken-winded and with
his feet full of sandcracks, to his master's
eyes he seemed a nobler steed than
Bucephalus, or Bavieca, the famous
charger of the Cid. It was evident that
such a noble steed, who was to carry a
warrior so famous, must have a name by
which all the world might know him; and
accordingly, after deliberating for four
days and passing in review a multitude
of titles, he determined to call the beast
Rozinante.</p>

<p>Having settled this weighty question,
he next began to consider what name he
should assume himself, being by no
means satisfied with that which he had
received from his father. Eight days
were passed in debating a matter so
important to himself and to posterity,
and at the end of that time he resolved
to call himself Don Quixote. But,
remembering that Amadis, not contented
with his simple name, had taken the
additional title of Amadis of Gaul, he
determined, in imitation of that illustrious
hero, his model and teacher in all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
things, to style himself Don Quixote de
La Mancha, and thereby confer immortal
honor on the land of his birth.</p>

<p>Nothing now remained but to choose
a lady to be the mistress of his affections
and the load-star of his life; for, as he
wisely reflected, a knight-errant without
a lady-love was like a tree without fruit
or a body without a soul. "If," he said
to himself, "I should encounter some
giant, as commonly happens to knights-errant,
and cut him in twain or otherwise
vanquish him and make him my prisoner,
will it not be well to have some lady to
whom I may send him as a gift, so that
he may enter the presence of my sweet
mistress and bow the knee before her,
saying in a humble and submissive
voice: 'Lady, <i>I am the giant Caraculiambro,
vanquished in single combat by the
knight Don Quixote de La Mancha, whose
praise no tongue can tell, and I have been
commanded by him to present myself to
your grace, that you may dispose of me as
your Highness pleases</i>.'"</p>

<p>Our good knight was highly pleased
with his own eloquence, and still more
so when he had made choice of his lady.
In a neighboring village there was a
young girl, employed on a farm, with
whom he had at one time been in love,
though he had never brought himself to
declare his passion. Her name was
Aldonza Lorenzo, and her he resolved to
constitute the queen of his heart, having
conferred on her the sounding title of
Dulcinea del Toboso, or "The Sweet
Lady of Toboso," the village where she
was born.</p>


<div class='center'><br />III. THE QUEST BEGINS</div>

<p>"The world is waiting for me," murmured
our enthusiast, leaping from his
bed at the first peep of dawn and arming
himself from head to foot. Then treading
softly, so as not to alarm the household,
he went to the stable, saddled
Rozinante, and leading him out through
a back gate of the yard, mounted and
rode forth into the plain, hugely delighted
to find himself fairly started on his great
enterprise.</p>

<p>But hardly had he reached the open
country when the terrible thought occurred
to him that he had not been
dubbed a knight and by the laws of
chivalry was not entitled to engage in
combat with any one who bore that
rank, and further, even if he were already
a knight, he was obliged as a novice to
wear plain armor, without device of any
kind. So much was he perturbed by
these reflections that he was within an
ace of giving up his whole design, and
would have done so but for a happy
inspiration, which saved mankind from
so dire a calamity. Many of the heroes
of his books of chivalry had got themselves
dubbed knight by the first person
whom they met, and remembering this,
he resolved to follow their example.
And as to his armor, he would rub
and polish it until it was whiter than
ermine.</p>

<p>His scruples thus removed, he continued
his journey, leaving his good steed
to choose what direction he pleased, as
was the fashion with knights-errant when
they set out on their adventures. Thus
pacing along and dreaming of mighty
deeds, he gave vent to his feelings in the
following rhapsody: "What a theme for
the eloquence of some great master of
style&mdash;the feats of high emprise wrought
by the valiant arm of Don Quixote de
La Mancha! Happy the pen which shall
describe them, happy the age which shall
read the wondrous tale! And thou,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span>
brave steed, shalt have thy part in the
honor which is done to thy master, when
poet and sculptor and painter shall vie
with one another in raising an eternal
monument to his fame."</p>

<p>Then recalling his part as an afflicted
lover, he began to mourn his hard lot in
soft and plaintive tones: "O lady Dulcinea,
queen of this captive heart! Why
hast thou withdrawn from me the light
of thy countenance and banished thy
faithful servant from thy presence?
Shorten, I implore thee, the term of my
penance and leave me not to wither in
solitude and despair."</p>

<p>Lost in these sublime and melancholy
thoughts he rode slowly on from hour to
hour, until the sun became so hot that
it was enough to melt his brains, if he
had possessed any. All that day he
continued his journey without meeting
with any adventure, which vexed him
sorely, for he was eager to encounter
some foeman worthy of his steel. Evening
came on, and both he and his horse
were ready to drop with hunger and
fatigue, when, looking about him in search
of some castle&mdash;or some hovel&mdash;where
he might find shelter and refreshment,
he saw not far from the roadside a small
inn, and, setting spurs to Rozinante,
rode up to the door at a hobbling canter
just as night was falling.</p>

<p>The inn was of the poorest and meanest
description, frequented by muleteers and
other rude wayfarers; but to his perverted
fancy it seemed a turreted castle, with
battlements of silver, drawbridge, and
moat, and all that belonged to a feudal
fortress. Before the door were standing
two women, vagabonds of the lowest
class, who were traveling in the company
of certain mule-drivers; but for him they
were instantly transformed into a pair
of high-born maidens taking the air
before the castle gate.</p>

<p>To complete his illusion, just at this
moment a swineherd, who was collecting
his drove from a neighboring stubble
field, sounded a few notes on his horn.
This Don Quixote took for a signal which
had been given by some dwarf from the
ramparts, to inform the inmates of the
castle of his approach; and so, with huge
satisfaction, he lifted his pasteboard
vizor, and uncovering his haggard and
dusty features, thus addressed the women
who were eyeing him with looks of no
small alarm, and evidently preparing to
retreat: "Fly not, gracious ladies,
neither wrong me by dreaming that ye
have aught to fear from me, for the order
of chivalry which I profess suffers not
that I should do harm to any, least of
all to maidens of lofty lineage, such as I
perceive you to be."</p>

<p>Hearing themselves accosted by that
extraordinary figure in language to which
they were so little used, the women
could not restrain their mirth, but
laughed so long and loud that Don
Quixote began to be vexed and said in a
tone of grave rebuke, "Beauty and discourtesy
are ill-matched together, and
unseemly is the laugh which folly breeds
in a vacant mind. Take not my words
amiss, for I mean no offence, but am
ready to serve you with heart and
hand."</p>

<p>At this dignified reproof, the damsels
only laughed louder than before, and
there is no saying what might have come
of it if the innkeeper, who appeared at
this moment, had not undertaken the
office of peacemaker, for which he was
well fitted, being a fat, good-humored
fellow, who loved a quiet life. At first,
when he saw that fantastic warrior on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
his spectral steed, he was much inclined
to join the girls in their noisy merriment.
But finding some ground for alarm in so
many engines of war, he contrived to
swallow his laughter, and going up to
Don Quixote, said to him civilly enough:
"If your honor is in search of quarters
for the night, you will find in this inn all
that you require excepting a bed, which
is not to be had here."</p>

<p>Finding the governor of the fortress&mdash;that
is to say, the landlord of the inn&mdash;so
obsequious, Don Quixote replied cheerfully:
"Sir Castellan, you will not find
me hard to please, for</p>

<div class='poem'>
Arms are all my rich array,<br />
My repose to fight alway."<br />
</div>

<p>"If that be your case, then," answered
the innkeeper, humoring his strange
guest, "'tis plain that</p>

<div class='poem'>
Your couch is the field, your pillow a shield,<br />
Your slumber a vigil from dusk until day:<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and therefore you may dismount in the
full assurance of finding under my humble
roof divers good reasons for keeping
awake for a twelvemonth, should such
be your desire."</div>

<p>As he said this, he went and held the
stirrup for Don Quixote, who was so
weak from his long fast that it cost him
much pain and effort to dismount. "I
commend to thy especial care this my
good steed," said he, as soon as he had
found his feet: "he is the rarest piece of
horseflesh that ever lived by bread."</p>

<p>The innkeeper bestowed but one glance
on poor Rozinante, and finding little to
admire in him, he thrust him hastily into
the stable and came back to attend to
the wants of his guest. Meanwhile Don
Quixote submitted to be disarmed by
the young women, who had now made
their peace. Having removed his body
armor, they tried to relieve him of his
helmet, which was attached to his neck
by green ribbons. Being unable to loose
the knots, they proposed to cut the ribbons,
but as he would not allow them to
do this, he was obliged to keep his helmet
on all that night, which made him the
strangest and most diverting object that
could be imagined.</p>

<p>While the ladies were thus employed,
our brave adventurer entertained them
with a strain of high-flown gallantry,
seasoned with scraps from the old ballads
and romances which he had read. Not
understanding a word of what he said,
they simply asked him, when they had
finished, if he wanted anything to eat.
"A slight refection would not be ill-timed,"
answered Don Quixote, and
learning that there was nothing to be
had but a "little trout," he bade them
bring it with all speed. "Many little
trouts," he added jestingly, "will serve
my turn as well as one big one. Only
let it be brought at once, for I begin to
be conscious of a wondrous void within
the compass of my sword-belt."</p>

<p>The "little trout" proved to be neither
more nor less than a dish of stockfish,
Poor John, or in plain English, salted
cod, and that of the rankest. An odor
the reverse of savory heralded its approach,
and Don Quixote sat down at
the table, which had been set, for coolness,
before the door, and applied himself
to his lenten fare. But being much
incommoded by his helmet, he could not
find the way to his mouth, and remained
staring in dismay at the reeking mess
and the filthy black bread which accompanied
it, until one of the damsels, perceiving
his distress, came to his relief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
and fed him with small morsels, which
she deftly conveyed to their proper
destination through the opening of his
helmet. To give him drink was a
harder matter, but this problem was
solved with great ingenuity by the landlord,
who brought a hollow cane, and
placing one end in his mouth, poured
the wine in at the other.</p>

<p>And so in solemn silence, broken now
and then by the stifled laughter of the
onlookers, the strange meal proceeded;
and when it was nearly at an end, a
clownish fellow passed by, blowing on
a rustic pipe. But for Don Quixote,
who had transformed the inn into a
castle, the fat publican into a powerful
governor, and the vagabond damsels
into high-born ladies, it was an easy
matter to find in those rude notes a
strain of rare music, provided for his
delectation while he sat at table; and he
concluded his repast in a state of high
satisfaction with his first day's adventures.</p>


<div class='center'><br />IV. THE KNIGHTLY VIGIL</div>

<p>But one uncomfortable thought chilled
the heat of his enthusiasm&mdash;he had not
yet been dubbed a knight and was therefore
still unqualified to engage in any
chivalrous adventure. Accordingly, as
soon as he had finished his scanty and
sordid meal, he took the landlord aside,
and shutting himself up with him in the
stable and falling on his knees before him,
said: "I will never rise from this posture,
valiant knight, until thou hast granted
me of thy courtesy the favor which I
desire, and which shall redound to thine
honor and to the benefit of the human
race."</p>

<p>Dumbfoundered at the strange attitude
and still stranger language of his guest,
the landlord stared at him, not knowing
what to do or say. He begged him to
rise, but Don Quixote steadily refused,
so that at last he was obliged to give
the promise required.</p>

<p>"I expected no less from your High
Mightiness," answered Don Quixote.
"And now hear what I desire: to-morrow
at dawn you shall dub me knight, and
to that end I will this night keep the
vigil of arms in the chapel of your castle,
so that I may be ready to receive
the order of chivalry in the morning
and forthwith set out on the path of
toil and glory which awaits those who
follow the perilous profession of knight-errant."</p>

<p>By this time the landlord began to
perceive that Don Quixote was not
right in his wits, and being somewhat
of a wag he resolved to make matter for
mirth by humoring his whim; and so he
replied that such ambition was most
laudable, and just what he would have
looked for in a gentleman of his gallant
presence. He had himself, he said, been
a cavalier of fortune in his youth&mdash;which
in a certain sense was true, for he had
been a notorious thief and rogue, known
to every magistrate in Spain&mdash;and now,
in his declining years, he was living in
the retirement of his castle, where his
chief pleasure was to entertain wandering
knights; which, being interpreted,
meant that he was a rascally landlord
and grew fat by cheating the unfortunate
travelers who stayed at his inn.</p>

<p>Then he went on to say that, with
regard to the vigil of arms, it could be
held in the courtyard of the castle, as
the chapel had been pulled down to make
place for a new one. "And to-morrow,"
he concluded, "you shall be dubbed a
knight&mdash;a full knight, and a perfect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
knight, so that none shall be more so
in all the world."</p>

<p>Having thanked the landlord for his
kindness, and promised to obey him, as
his adoptive father, in all things, Don
Quixote at once prepared to perform the
vigil of arms. Collecting his armor, he
laid the several pieces in a horse-trough
which stood in the center of the inn-yard,
and then, taking his shield on his arm
and grasping his lance, he began to pace
up and down with high-bred dignity
before the trough.</p>

<p>The landlord had lost no time in informing
those who were staying at the
inn of the mad freaks of his guest, and
a little crowd was gathered to watch his
proceedings from a distance, which they
were the better able to do as the moon
was shining with unusual brightness.
Sometimes they saw him stalking to
and fro, with serene composure, and
sometimes he would pause in his march
and stand for a good while leaning on
his lance and scanning his armor with a
fixed and earnest gaze.</p>

<p>While this was going on, one of the
mule-drivers took it into his head to
water his team, and approaching the
horse-trough prepared to remove Don
Quixote's armor, which was in his way.
Perceiving his intentions, Don Quixote
cried to him in a loud voice, saying:
"O thou, whoever thou art, audacious
knight who drawest near to touch the
armor of the bravest champion that
ever girt on sword, look what thou
doest, and touch it not, if thou wouldst
not pay for thy rashness with thy life!"</p>

<p>The valiant defiance was thrown away
on the muleteer, whose thick head needed
other arguments, and taking the armor
by the straps, he flung it a good way
from him. Which when Don Quixote
saw, he raised his eyes to heaven, and
fixing his thoughts (as may be supposed)
on his lady Dulcinea, he exclaimed:
"Shine on me, light of my life, now,
when the first insult is offered to my
devoted heart! Let not thy countenance
and favor desert me in this, my first
adventure."</p>

<p>As he put up this pious appeal he let
go his shield, and lifting his lance in both
hands, brought it down with such force
on the muleteer's head that he fell senseless
to the ground; and if the blow had
been followed by another, he would have
needed no physician to cure him. Having
done this, Don Quixote collected his
armor, and began pacing up and down
again, with the same tranquility as
before.</p>

<p>Presently another muleteer, knowing
nothing of what had happened, came up
to the trough with the same intention
as the first and was about to lay hands
on the armor when Don Quixote, without
uttering a word or asking favor of any
one, once more lifted his lance and dealt
the fellow two smart strokes, which made
two cross gashes on his crown.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the alarm had been raised
in the house, and the whole troop of
muleteers now came running to avenge
their comrades. Seeing himself threatened
by a general assault, Don Quixote
drew his sword, and thrusting his arm
into his shield cried: "Queen of Beauty,
who givest power and might to this
feeble heart, now let thine eyes be
turned upon thy slave, who stands on
the threshold of so great a peril."</p>

<p>His words were answered by the
muleteers with a shower of stones, which
he kept off as well as he could with his
shield. At the noise of the fray the innkeeper
came puffing up, and called upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
the muleteers to desist. "The man is
mad," said he, "as I told you before,
and the law cannot touch him, though
he should kill you all."</p>

<p>"Ha! art thou there, base and recreant
knight?" shouted Don Quixote in a
voice of thunder. "Is this thy hospitality
to knights-errant? 'Tis well for thee
that I have not yet received the order of
knighthood, or I would have paid thee
home for this outrage. As to you, base
and sordid pack, I care not for you a
straw. Come one, come all, and take
the wages of your folly and presumption."</p>

<p>His tones were so threatening, and his
aspect was so formidable, that he struck
terror into the hearts of his assailants,
who drew back and left off throwing
stones; and, after some further parley,
he allowed them to carry off the wounded,
and returned with unruffled dignity to
the vigil of arms.</p>

<p>The landlord was now thoroughly tired
of his guest's wild antics, and, resolving
to make an end of the business, lest
worse should come of it, he went up to
Don Quixote and asked pardon for the
violence of that low-born rabble, who
had acted, he said, without his knowledge,
and had been properly chastised for their
temerity. He added that the ceremony
of conferring knighthood might be performed
in any place, and that two hours
sufficed for the vigil of arms, so that
Don Quixote had fulfilled this part of
his duty twice over, as he had now been
watching for double that time.</p>

<p>All this was firmly believed by Don
Quixote, and he requested that he might
be made a knight without further delay;
for if, he said, he were attacked again,
after receiving the order of chivalry, he
was determined not to leave a soul alive
in the castle, excepting those to whom
he might show mercy at the governor's
desire.</p>

<p>The landlord, whose anxiety was increased
by this alarming threat, went
and fetched a book in which he kept
his accounts, and came back, attended
by a boy who carried a stump of candle,
and by the two damsels aforesaid. Then,
bidding Don Quixote to kneel before him,
he began to murmur words from his
book, in the tone of one who was saying
his prayers, and in the midst of his reading
he raised his hand and gave Don
Quixote a smart blow on the neck, and
then taking the sword laid it gently on
his shoulder, muttering all the time
between his teeth with the same air of
devotion. Then he directed one of the
ladies to gird on his sword, which she did
with equal liveliness and discretion&mdash;and
she had much need of the latter
quality to prevent an explosion of
laughter&mdash;; however, the specimen which
the new knight had just given of his
prowess kept their merriment in check.</p>

<p>When his spurs had been buckled on
by the other damsel, the ceremony was
completed, and after some further compliments
Don Quixote saddled Rozinante
and rode forth, a new-made knight,
ready to astonish the world with feats
of arms and chivalry. The innkeeper,
who was glad to see the last of him, let
him go without making any charge for
what he had consumed.</p>


<div class='center'><br />V. ON HONOR'S FIELD</div>

<p>On leaving the inn Don Quixote turned
his horse's steps homewards, being resolved
to obtain a supply of money, and,
above all, to provide himself with a
squire before seeking more distant scenes
of adventure. Presently he came to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
cross-road, and after hesitating a moment,
he resolved to imitate his favorite
heroes by leaving the direction to his
steed, who immediately took the nearest
way to his stable. After advancing
about two leagues, our knight came in
view of a great troop of people, who, as
it afterwards turned out, were merchants
of Toledo, on their way to Murcia
to buy silk. There were six of them
jogging comfortably along under their
umbrellas, with four servants on horseback,
and three mule-drivers walking
and leading their beasts.</p>

<p>Here was a new opportunity, as Don
Quixote thought, of displaying his knightly
valor, so he settled himself firmly in
his stirrups, grasped his lance, covered
his breast with his shield, and stood
waiting for the arrival of those knights-errant,&mdash;for
such he judged them to be;
and when they were come within hearing,
he raised his voice and cried with an air
of proud defiance: "Halt, every mother's
son of you, and confess that in all the
world there is no damsel more beautiful
than the empress of La Mancha, the
peerless Dulcinea del Toboso!"</p>

<p>Hearing the strange words and seeing
the extravagant figure of him who
uttered them, the merchants drew up,
and one of them, who was of a waggish
disposition, answered for the whole
company and said: "Sir Knight, we do
not know the good lady of whom you
speak; let us see her, and if she is of
such beauty as you describe, we will
most gladly make the confession which
you require."</p>

<p>"If you were to see her," replied Don
Quixote, "you must needs be convinced
that what I say is true, and that would
be a poor triumph for me. No, on the
faith of my word alone, you must believe
it, confess it, assert it, swear to it, and
maintain it! If not, I defy you to
battle, ye sons of lawlessness and arrogance!
Here I stand ready to receive
you, whether ye come singly, as the
rule of knighthood demands, or all
together, as is the custom with churls
like you."</p>

<p>"Sir Knight," answered the merchant,
"I entreat you in the name of all this
noble company, that you constrain us
not to lay perjury to our souls by swearing
to a thing which we have neither
seen nor heard. Show us, at least, some
portrait of this lady, though it be no
bigger than a grain of wheat, that our
scruples may be satisfied. For so strongly
are we disposed in favor of the fair
dame, that even if the picture should
exhibit her squinting with one eye, and
dropping brimstone and vermilion from
the other, for all that we will vow and
profess that she is as lovely as you say."</p>

<p>"There drops not from her," shouted
Don Quixote, aflame with fury, "there
drops not, I say, that which thou namest,
but only sweet perfumes and pearly dew.
Neither is she cross-eyed nor hunch-backed,
but straight and slender as a
peak of Guadarrama. But ye shall pay
for the monstrous blasphemy which ye
have spoken against the angelic beauty
of my lady and queen."</p>

<p>With these words he leveled his lance
and hurled himself upon the speaker with
such vigor and frenzy that if Rozinante
had not chanced to stumble and fall in
mid career, the rash merchant would
have paid dear for his jest. Down went
Rozinante, and his master rolled over and
over for some distance across the plain.
Being brought up at last by a projecting
rock, he made frantic efforts to rise, but
was kept down by the weight of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
armor and lay plunging and kicking on
his back, but ceased not for a moment to
hurl threats and defiances at his laughing
foes. "Fly not, ye cowards, ye dastards!
Wait awhile! Tis not by my
fault, but by the fault of my horse that
I lie prostrate here."</p>

<p>One of the mule-drivers, who was
somewhat hot-tempered, was so provoked
by the haughty language of the poor
fallen knight, that he resolved to give him
the answer on his ribs, and running up
he snatched the lance from Don Quixote's
hands, broke it in pieces, and taking one
of them began to beat him with such
good-will that in spite of the armor he
bruised him like wheat in a mill-hopper.
And he found the exercise so much to
his liking that he continued it until he
had shivered every fragment of the
broken lance into splinters. Nevertheless
he could not stop the mouth of our
valiant knight, who during all that
tempest of blows went on defying heaven
and earth and shouting menaces against
those bandits, as he now supposed them
to be.</p>

<p>At length the mule-driver grew weary,
and the whole party rode off, leaving the
battered champion on the ground. When
they were gone he made another attempt
to rise. But if he failed when he was
sound and whole, how much less could
he do it now that he was almost hammered
to pieces! Notwithstanding, his
heart was light and gay, for in his own
fancy he was a hero of romance, lying
covered with wounds on honor's field.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VI. THE RETURN HOME</div>

<p>Two days had passed since Don
Quixote left his home, and his niece and
his housekeeper were growing very anxious
about him. More than once they
had heard him declare his intention to
turn knight-errant, and they began to
fear that he had carried out his mad
design. On the evening of the second
day, a few hours after he had been so
roughly handled by the muleteer, they
heard a loud voice calling outside the
street door: "Open to Sir Baldwin and the
Lord Marquis of Mantua, who is brought
to your gates grievously wounded."
They made haste to unbar the door, and
when it was opened they saw a strange
sight: mounted on an ass, whose head
was held by a laboring man of the village,
sat Don Quixote, huddled together in a
most uncavalier-like posture, his armor
all battered and his face begrimed with
dirt. Hard by stood Rozinante, a woeful
object, crooking his knees and drooping
his head; and tied in a bundle on his
back were the splintered fragments of
Don Quixote's lance.</p>

<p>When they saw who it was, they
gathered round him with eager questions
and cries of welcome; but he checked them
with a gesture and said: "Control yourselves,
all of you! I am grievously hurt,
and if it be possible let some one go and
fetch Urganda the wise woman, that she
may examine and heal my wounds."</p>

<p>"Alack-a-day!" cried the housekeeper,
lifting up her hands. "Did I not tell
you, gentlemen, that I knew on which
foot my master halted? Come, dear sir,
and we will cure you, without the help
of Urganda or anyone else." And with
many maledictions against the books of
chivalry which had done the kind gentleman
so ill a turn, she assisted him to dismount,
and amongst them they carried
him to his room, took off his armor, and
laid him on his bed. Then they inquired
where he was hurt, and Don Quixote
exclaimed that he was bruised from head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
to foot, having been thrown from his
horse in an encounter with ten giants,
the most outrageous and ferocious in the
world.</p>


<div class='center'><br />VII. THE BATTLE WITH THE WINDMILLS</div>

<p>For two weeks Don Quixote remained
peacefully at home, and many were the
pleasant discussions which passed between
him and his old friends, the priest
and barber, on his favorite theme&mdash;the
pressing need of reviving the profession
of knight-errantry, and his own peculiar
fitness for rendering this great service to
the world. All this time he was secretly
negotiating with a certain peasant, a
neighbor of his, whose name was Sancho
Panza, an honest, poor man, not much
better furnished with wits than the
knight himself. This simple fellow lent a
ready ear to his grand tales of glory and
conquest, and at last consented to follow
him as his squire, being especially tempted
by certain mysterious hints which Don
Quixote let fall concerning an "Isle," of
which his new master promised to make
him governor at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>This matter being arranged Don
Quixote patched up his armor, obtained
a new lance, and having provided himself
with a sum of money, gave notice to
his squire of the day on which he proposed
to start. Sancho, who was short
and fat and little used to traveling on
foot, asked leave to bring his ass, remarking
that it was a very good one. This
proposal gave the knight pause, for, try
as he would, he could remember no
authority for a squire on a long-eared
charger; but finally he gave the required
permission, resolving to furnish him with
a worthier steed as soon as possible, by
taking the horse of the first discourteous
knight whom he met.</p>

<p>When all was ready they set off together
one night, without taking leave of
their families, and rode steadily on, so
that by daybreak they were beyond the
reach of pursuit. Sancho Panza sat his
ass like a patriarch, carrying with him
his saddle-bags and leather bottle; and
all his thoughts were of the Isle which
his master had promised him. Don
Quixote was lost in loftier meditations
until he was roused from his reverie by
the voice of his squire, who said: "I hope
your Grace has not forgotten the Isle
which I was to have, for I shall know
well how to govern it, however big it
may be."</p>

<p>"As to that," replied Don Quixote
"thou needest have no fear; I shall only
be complying with an ancient and honorable
custom of knights-errant, and, indeed,
I purpose to improve on their
practice, for, instead of waiting, as they
often did, until thou art worn out in my
service, I shall seek the first occasion to
bestow on thee this gift; and it may be
that before a week has passed thou wilt
be crowned king of that Isle."</p>

<p>"Well," said Sancho, "if this miracle
should come to pass, my good wife Joan
will be a queen and my sons young
princes."</p>

<p>"Who doubts it?" answered Don
Quixote.</p>

<p>"I do," rejoined Sancho. "My Joan
a queen! Nay, if it rained crowns, I
don't believe that one would ever settle
on my dame's head. Believe me, your
honor, she's not worth three farthings
as a queen; she might manage as a
countess, though that would be hard
enough."</p>

<p>"Think not so meanly of thyself,
Sancho," said Don Quixote, gravely.
"Marquis is the very least title which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
intend for thee, if thou wilt be content
with that."</p>

<p>"That I will, and heaven bless your
honor," said Sancho heartily. "I will
take what you give and be thankful,
knowing that you will not make the
burden too heavy for my back."</p>

<p>Chatting thus, they reached the top
of rising ground and saw before them
thirty or forty windmills in the plain
below; and as soon as Don Quixote set
eyes on them he said to his squire:
"Friend Sancho, we are in luck to-day!
See, there stands a troop of monstrous
giants, thirty or more, and with them I
will forthwith do battle and slay them
every one. With their spoils we will lay
the foundation of our fortune, as is the
victor's right; moreover it is doing heaven
good service to sweep this generation of
vipers from off the face of the earth."</p>

<p>"What giants do you mean?" asked
Sancho Panza.</p>

<p>"Those whom thou seest yonder,"
answered his master, "with the long
arms, which in such creatures are sometimes
two leagues in length."</p>

<p>"What is your honor thinking of?"
cried Sancho. "Those are not giants,
but windmills, and their arms, as you call
them, are the sails, which, being driven
by the wind, set the millstones going."</p>

<p>"'Tis plain," said Don Quixote, "that
thou hast still much to learn in our school
of adventures. I tell thee they are
giants, and if thou art afraid, keep out
of the way and pass the time in prayer
while I am engaged with them in fierce
and unequal battle."</p>

<p>Saying this, he set spurs to Rozinante,
and turning a deaf ear to the cries of
Sancho, who kept repeating that the
supposed giants were nothing but windmills,
he thundered across the plain,
shouting at the top of his voice: "Fly
not, ye cowardly loons, for it is only a
single knight who is coming to attack
you!"</p>

<p>Just at this moment there came a puff
of wind, which set the sails in motion;
seeing which, Don Quixote cried: "Ay,
swing your arms! If ye had more of them
than Briareos himself, I would make you
pay for it." Then, with a heartfelt
appeal to his lady Dulcinea, he charged
full gallop at the nearest mill, and pierced
the descending sail with his lance. The
weapon was shivered to pieces, and horse
and rider, caught by the sweep of the
sail, were sent rolling with great violence
across the plain.</p>

<p>"Heaven preserve us!" cried Sancho,
who had followed as fast as his ass could
trot, and found his master lying very
still by the side of his steed. "Did I not
warn your honor that those things were
windmills and not giants at all? Surely
none could fail to see it, unless he had
such another whirligig in his own pate!"</p>

<p>"Be silent, good Sancho!" replied Don
Quixote, "and know that the things of
war, beyond all others, are subject to
continual mutation. Moreover, in the
present case I think, nay, I am sure,
that an alien power has been at work,
even that wicked enchanter Friston; he
it is who has changed those giants into
windmills to rob me of the honor of their
defeat. But in the end all his evil devices
shall be baffled by my good sword."</p>

<p>"Heaven grant that it may be so!"
said Sancho, assisting him to rise; and
the knight then remounted Rozinante,
whose shoulders were almost splayed by
his fall, and turned his face towards the
Puerto Lapice, a rugged mountain pass
through which ran the main road from
Madrid to Andalusia; for such a place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
he thought, could not fail to afford rich
and varied matter for adventures.</p>

<h4><br />THE PROUD KING</h4>

<div class='center'>HORACE E. SCUDDER</div>

<p>There was once a king who ruled over
many lands; he went to war, and added
one country after another to his kingdom.
At last he came to be emperor, and that
is as much as any man can be. One
night, after he was crowned emperor,
he lay awake and thought about himself.</p>

<p>"Surely," he said, "no one can be
greater than I am, on earth or in heaven."</p>

<p>The proud king fell asleep with these
thoughts. When he awoke, the day was
fair, and he looked out on the pleasant
world.</p>

<p>"Come," he said to the men about
him; "to-day we will go a-hunting."</p>

<p>The horses were brought, the dogs
came leaping, the horns sounded, and
the proud king with his courtiers rode
off to the sport. They had hunted all
the morning, and were now in a deep
wood. In the fields the sun had beat
upon their heads, and they were glad
of the shade of the trees; but the proud
king wished for something more. He
saw a lake not far off, and he said to
his men:</p>

<p>"Bide ye here, while I bathe in the
lake and cool myself."</p>

<p>Then he rode apart till he came to the
shore of the lake. There he got down
from his horse, laid aside his clothes,
and plunged into the cool water. He
swam about, and sometimes dived
beneath the surface, and so was once
more cool and fresh.</p>

<p>Now while the proud king was swimming
away from the shore and diving
to the bottom, there came one who had
the same face and form as the king.
He drew near the shore, dressed himself
in the king's clothes, mounted the king's
horse and rode away. So when the
proud king was once more cool and fresh,
and came to the place where he had left
his clothes and his horse, there were no
clothes to be seen, and no horse.</p>

<p>The proud king looked about, but saw
no man. He called, but no one heard
him. The air was mild, but the wood
was dark, and no sunshine came through
to warm him after his cool bath. He
walked by the shore of the lake and cast
about in his mind what he should do.</p>

<p>"I have it," he cried at last. "Not
far from here lives a knight. It was but
a few days ago that I made him a knight
and gave him a castle. I will go to him,
and he will be glad enough to clothe
his king."</p>

<p>The proud king wove some reeds into
a mat and bound the mat about him,
and then he walked to the castle of the
knight. He beat loudly at the gate of
the castle and called for the porter. The
porter came and stood behind the gate.
He did not draw the bolt at once, but
asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"Open the gate," said the proud king,
"and you will see who I am."</p>

<p>The porter opened the gate, and was
amazed at what he saw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Wretch!" said the proud king; "I
am the emperor. Go to your master.
Bid him come to me with clothes. I
have lost both clothes and horse."</p>

<p>"A pretty emperor!" the porter
laughed. "The great emperor was here
not an hour ago. He came with his
court from a hunt. My master was
with him and sat at meat with him.
But stay you here. I will call my master.
Oh, yes! I will show him the emperor,"
and the porter wagged his beard and
laughed, and went within.</p>

<p>He came forth again with the knight
and pointed at the proud king.</p>

<p>"There is the emperor!" he said.
"Look at him! look at the great emperor!"</p>

<p>"Draw near," said the proud king to
the knight, "and kneel to me. I gave
thee this castle. I made thee knight.
I give thee now a greater gift. I give
thee the chance to clothe thy emperor
with clothes of thine own."</p>

<p>"You dog!" cried the knight. "You
fool! I have just ridden with the
emperor, and have come back to my
castle. Here!" he shouted to his servants,
"beat this fellow and drive him
away from the gate."</p>

<p>The porter looked on and laughed.</p>

<p>"Lay on well," he said to the other
servants. "It is not every day that
you can flog an emperor."</p>

<p>Then they beat the proud king, and
drove him from the gate of the castle.</p>

<p>"Base knight!" said the proud king.
"I gave him all he has, and this is how
he repays me. I will punish him when
I sit on my throne again. I will go
to the duke who lives not far away.
Him I have known all my days. He
will know me. He will know his
emperor."</p>

<p>So he came to the gate of the duke's
great hall, and knocked three times.
At the third knock the porter opened the
gate, and saw before him a man clad
only in a mat of reeds, and stained and
bleeding.</p>

<p>"Go, I pray you, to the duke," said
the proud king, "and bid him come to
me. Say to him that the emperor
stands at the gate. He has been robbed
of his clothes and of his horse. Go
quickly to your master."</p>

<p>The porter closed the gate between
them, and went within to the duke.</p>

<p>"Your Grace," said he, "there is a
madman at the gate. He is unclad and
wild. He bade me come to you and
tell you that he was the emperor."</p>

<p>"Here is a strange thing indeed," said
the duke; "I will see it for myself."</p>

<p>So he went to the gate, followed by
his servants, and when the porter opened
it there stood the proud king. The
proud king knew the duke, but the duke
saw only a bruised and beaten madman.</p>

<p>"Do you not know me?" cried the
proud king. "I am your emperor. Only
this morning you were on the hunt with
me. I left you that I might bathe in
the lake. While I was in the water,
some wretch took both my clothes and
my horse, and I&mdash;I have been beaten
by a base knight."</p>

<p>"Put him in chains," said the duke to
his servants. "It is not safe to have
such a man free. Give him some straw
to lie on, and some bread and water."</p>

<p>The duke turned away and went back
to his hall, where his friends sat at table.</p>

<p>"That was a strange thing," he said.
"There was a madman at the gate. He
must have been in the wood this morning,
for he told me that I was on the hunt
with the emperor, and so I was; and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
told me that the emperor went apart to
bathe in the lake, and so he did. But
he said that some one stole the clothes
and the horse of the emperor, yet the
emperor rode back to us cool and fresh,
and clothed and on his horse. And he
said"&mdash;And the duke looked around on
his guests.</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He said that he was the emperor."</p>

<p>Then the guests fell to talking and
laughing, and soon forgot the strange
thing. But the proud king lay in a dark
prison, far even from the servants of
the duke. He lay on straw, and chains
bound his feet.</p>

<p>"What is this that has come upon me?"
he said. "Am I brought so low? Am I
so changed that even the duke does not
know me? At least there is one who
will know me, let me wear what I may."</p>

<p>Then, by much labor, he loosed the
chains that bound him, and fled in the
night from the duke's prison. When the
morning came, he stood at the door of
his own palace. He stood there awhile;
perhaps some one would open the door
and let him in. But no one came, and
the proud king lifted his hand and
knocked; he knocked at the door of his
own palace. The porter came at last and
looked at him.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked, "and what
do you want?"</p>

<p>"Do you not know me?" cried the
proud king. "I am your master. I
am the king. I am the emperor. Let
me pass"; and he would have thrust
him aside. But the porter was a strong
man; he stood in the doorway, and would
not let the proud king enter.</p>

<p>"You my master! you the emperor!
poor fool, look here!" and he held the
proud king by the arm while he pointed
to a hall beyond. There sat the emperor
on his throne, and by his side was the
queen.</p>

<p>"Let me go to her! she will know
me," cried the proud king, and he tried
to break away from the porter. The
noise without was heard in the hall.
The nobles came out, and last of all
came the emperor and the queen. When
the proud king saw these two, he could
not speak. He was choked with rage
and fear, and he knew not what.</p>

<p>"You know me!" at last he cried.
"I am your lord and husband."</p>

<p>The queen shrank back.</p>

<p>"Friends," said the man who stood
by her, "what shall be done to this
wretch?"</p>

<p>"Kill him," said one.</p>

<p>"Put out his eyes," said another.</p>

<p>"Beat him," said a third.</p>

<p>Then they all hustled the proud king
out of the palace court. Each one gave
him a blow, and so he was thrust out,
and the door was shut behind him.</p>

<p>The proud king fled, he knew not
whither. He wished he were dead.
By and by he came to the lake where
he had bathed. He sat down on the
shore. It was like a dream, but he knew
he was awake, for he was cold and
hungry and faint. Then he knelt on
the ground and beat his breast, and said:</p>

<p>"I am no emperor. I am no king.
I am a poor, sinful man. Once I thought
there was no one greater than I, on earth
or in heaven. Now I know that I am
nothing, and there is no one so poor and
so mean. God forgive me for my pride."</p>

<p>As he said this, tears stood in his
eyes. He wiped them away and rose
to his feet. Close by him he saw the
clothes which he had once laid aside.
Near at hand was his horse, eating the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
soft grass. The king put on his clothes;
he mounted his horse and rode to his
palace. As he drew near, the door
opened and servants came forth. One
held his horse; another helped him
dismount. The porter bowed low.</p>

<p>"I marvel I did not see thee pass
out, my lord," he said.</p>

<p>The king entered, and again saw the
nobles in the great hall. There stood
the queen also, and by her side was the
man who called himself emperor. But
the queen and the nobles did not look
at him; they looked at the king, and
came forward to meet him.</p>

<p>This man also came forward, but he
was clad in shining white, and not in
the robes of the emperor. The king
bowed his head before him.</p>

<p>"I am thy angel," said the man.
"Thou wert proud, and made thyself
to be set on high. Therefore thou hast
been brought low. I have watched over
thy kingdom. Now I give it back to
thee, for thou art once again humble,
and the humble only are fit to rule."</p>

<p>Then the angel disappeared. No one
else heard his voice, and the nobles
thought the king had bowed to them.
So the king once more sat on the throne,
and ruled wisely and humbly ever after.</p>

<div class="hang1">Eva March Tappan (1854&mdash;) has compiled
many books for children, including the
popular collection in ten volumes called
<i>The Children's Hour</i>. Among her most
delightful books is <i>Robin Hood: His Book</i>,
from which the following story is taken,
(by permission of the publishers, Little,
Brown &amp; Co., Boston). Some few moralists
have been distressed about giving
stories of an outlaw to children, but Robin
Hood was really the champion of the people
against tyrannous oppression and injustice.
This is the fact that children never miss,
and the thing that endears Robin and his
followers in Lincoln green. There is, of
course, the further interesting fact that
these stories take place out in the open and
have the charm that comes from adventures
and wanderings through the secrecies of
ancient Sherwood Forest. Against this
outdoor background are displayed the good
old "virtues of courage, forbearance, gentleness,
courtesy, justice, and championship."</div>


<h4><br />ROBIN AND THE MERRY LITTLE
OLD WOMAN</h4>

<div class='center'>EVA MARCH TAPPAN<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
"Monday I wash and Tuesday I iron,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wednesday I cook and I mend;</span><br />
Thursday I brew and Friday I sweep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And baking day brings the end."</span><br />
</div>

<p>So sang the merry little old woman as
she sat at her wheel and spun; but
when she came to the last line she really
could not help pushing back the flax-wheel
and springing to her feet. Then
she held out her skirt and danced a gay
little jig as she sang,&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
"Hey down, down, an a down!"<br />
</div>

<p>She curtseyed to one side of the room
and then to another, and before she knew
it she was curtseying to a man who stood
in the open door.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" cried the merry little
old woman. "Whatever shall I do?
An old woman ought to sit and spin
and not be dancing like a young girl.
Oh, but it's Master Robin! Glad am
I to set eyes on you, Master Robin.
Come in, and I'll throw my best cloak
over the little stool for a cushion. Don't
be long standing on the threshold,
Master Robin."</p>

<p>"It'll mayhap come to pass that I'll
wish I had something to stand on,"
said Robin, grimly, "for the proud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
bishop is in the forest, and he's after
me with all his men. It's night and
day that he's been following me, and
now he's caught me surely. You've
no meal chest, have you, and you've
no press, and you've no feather-bed
that'll hide me? There's but the one
wee bit room, and there's not even a
mousehole."</p>

<p>The little woman's heart beat fast.
What could she do?</p>

<p>"I mind me well of a Saturday night,"
said she, "when I'd but little firewood
and it was bitter cold, that you and your
men brought me such fine logs as the
great folks at the hall don't have; and
then you came in yourself and gave me
a pair of shoon and some brand-new
hosen, all soft and fine and woolly&mdash;I
don't believe the king himself has such
a pair&mdash;oh, Master Robin, I've thought
of something. Give me your mantle
of green and your fine gray tunic, and
do you put on my kirtle and jacket and
gown, and tie my red and blue kerchief
over your head&mdash;you gave it to me
yourself, you did; it was on Easter Day
in the morning&mdash;and do you sit down
at the wheel and spin. See, you put
your foot on the treadle <i>so</i>, to turn the
wheel, and you twist the flax with your
fingers <i>so</i>. Don't you get up, but just
turn the wheel and grumble and mumble
to yourself."</p>

<p>It was not long before the bishop and
all his men came riding up to the little
old woman's house. The bishop thrust
open the door and called:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Old woman, what have you done with
Robin Hood?" but Robin sat grumbling
and mumbling at the wheel and answered
never a word to the proud bishop.</p>

<p>"She's mayhap daft," said one of the
bishop's men. "We'll soon find him";
and in a minute he had looked up the
chimney and behind the dresser and
under the wooden bedstead. Then he
turned to the corner cupboard.</p>

<p>"You're daft yourself," said the bishop,
"to look in that little place for a strong
man like Robin." And all the time the
spinner at the wheel sat grumbling and
mumbling. It was a queer thread that
was wound on the spool, but no one
thought of that. It was Robin that
they wanted, and they cared little what
kind of thread an old woman in a cottage
was a-spinning.</p>

<p>"He's here, your Reverence," called
a man who had opened the lower door
of the corner cupboard.</p>

<p>"Bring him out and set him on the
horse," ordered the bishop, "and see to
it that you treat him like a wax candle
in the church. The king's bidden that
the thief and outlaw be brought to him,
and I well know he'll hang the rogue
on a gallows so high that it will show
over the whole kingdom; but he has
given orders that no one shall have the
reward if the rascal has but a bruise on
his finger, save that it came in a fair
fight."</p>

<p>So the merry little old woman in
Robin's tunic and Robin's green cloak
was set gently on a milk-white steed.
The bishop himself mounted a dapple-gray,
and down the road they went.</p>

<p>It was the cheeriest party that one
can imagine. The bishop went laughing
all the way for pure delight that he had
caught Robin Hood. He told more
stories than one could make up in an
age of leap-years, and they were all
about where he went and what he did
in the days before he became bishop.
The men were so happy at the thought
of having the great reward the king had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
offered that they laughed at the bishop's
stories louder than any one had ever
laughed at them before. And as for the
merry little old woman, she had the
gayest time of all, though she had to
keep her face muffled in her hood, and
couldn't laugh aloud the least bit, and
couldn't jump down from the great
white horse and dance the gay little
jig that her feet were fairly aching to try.</p>

<p>While the merry little old woman was
riding off with the bishop and his men,
Robin sat at the flax-wheel and spun
and spun till he could no longer hear
the beat of the horses' hoofs on the hard
ground. No time had he to take off the
kirtle and the jacket and the kerchief of
red and blue, for no one knew when
the proud bishop might find out that
he had the wrong prisoner, and would
come galloping back to the cottage on
the border of the forest.</p>

<p>"If I can only get to my good men and
true!" thought Robin; and he sprang
up from the little flax-wheel with the
distaff in his hand, and ran out of the
open door.</p>

<p>All the long day had Robin been away
from his bowmen, and as the twilight
time drew near, they were more and
more fearful of what might have befallen
him. They went to the edge of the
forest, and there they sat with troubled
faces.</p>

<p>"I've heard that the sheriff was seen
but two days ago on the eastern side of
the wood," said Much the miller's son.</p>

<p>"And the proud bishop's not in his
palace," muttered Will Scarlet. "Where
he's gone I know not, but may the saints
keep Master Robin from meeting him.
He hates us men of the greenwood worse
than the sheriff does, and he'd hang any
one of us to the nearest oak."</p>

<p>"He'd not hang Master Robin,"
declared Much the miller's son, "for
the bishop likes good red gold, and the
king's offered a great reward for him
alive and unhurt." The others laughed,
but in a moment they were grave again,
and peered anxiously through the trees
in one way and then in another, while
nearer came the twilight.</p>

<p>"There are folks who say the forest
is haunted," said Little John. "I never
saw anything, but one night when
I was close to the little black pond
that lies to the westward, I heard a cry
that wasn't from bird or beast; I know
that."</p>

<p>"And didn't you see anything?"
asked Much the miller's son.</p>

<p>"No," answered Little John, "but
where there's a cry, there's something
to make the cry, and it wasn't bird or
beast; I'm as sure of that as I am that
my name is Little John."</p>

<p>"But it isn't," declared Friar Tuck.
"You were christened John Little." No
one smiled, for they were too much
troubled about Robin.</p>

<p>"When I was a youngster," said
William Scarlet, "I had an old nurse,
and she told me that a first cousin of
hers knew a woman whose husband was
going through the forest by night, and
he saw a witch carry a round bundle
under her arm. It was wrapped up in
a brown kerchief; and while he looked,
the wind blew the kerchief away, and
he saw that the round bundle was a
man's head. The mouth of it opened
and called, 'Help! help!' He shot an
arrow through the old witch, and then
he said to the head, 'Where do you want
to go? Whose head are you?' The
head answered, 'I'm your head, and I
want to go on your shoulders.' Then he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
put up his hand, and, sure enough, his
own head was gone, and there it lay on
the ground beside the dead witch with
the arrow sticking through her. He
took up the head and set it on his
shoulders. This was the story that he
told when he came back in the morning,
but no one knew whether really to believe
it all or not. After that night he always
carried his head a bit on one side, and
some said it was because he hadn't set
it back quite straight: but there are some
folks that won't believe anything unless
they see it themselves, and they said he
had had a drink or two more than he
should and that he took cold in his
neck from sleeping with his head on
the wet moss."</p>

<p>"Everybody knows there are witches,"
said Will Scarlet, "and folks say that
wherever they may be through the day,
they run to the forest when the sun
begins to sink, and while they're running
they can't say any magic words to hurt
a man if he shoots them."</p>

<p>"What's that?" whispered Much the
miller's son softly, and he fitted an arrow
to the string.</p>

<p>"Wait; make a cross on it first,"
said Little John.</p>

<p>Something was flitting over the little
moor. The soft gray mist hid the lower
part of it, but the men could see what
looked like the upper part of a woman's
body, scurrying along through the fog
in some mysterious fashion. Its arms
were tossing wildly about, and it seemed
to be beckoning. The head was covered
with what might have been a kerchief,
but it was too dusky to see clearly.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot till it's nearer," whispered
William Scarlet. "They say if
you hurt a witch and don't kill her
outright, you'll go mad forever after."</p>

<p>Nearer came the witch, but still Much
the miller's son waited with his bow
bent and the arrow aimed. The witch
ran under the low bough of a tree, the
kerchief was caught on a broken limb,
and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, it's Master Robin!" shouted
Much the miller's son. "It's Master
Robin himself"; and so it was. No
time had he taken to throw off the gray
kirtle and the black jacket and the blue
and red kerchief about his head; for
as soon as ever he could no longer hear
the tramp of the horses's hoofs, he had
run with the distaff still in his hand to
the shelter of the good greenwood and
the help of his own faithful men and
true.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bishop was still telling
stories of what he did before he was a
bishop, and the men were laughing at
them, and the merry little old woman
was having the gayest time of all, even
though she dared not laugh out loud.</p>

<p>Now that the bishop had caught
Robin Hood he had no fear of the greenwood
rangers; and as the forest road
was much nearer than the highway,
down the forest road the happy company
went. The merry little old woman had
sometimes sat on a pillion and ridden a
farm beast from the plough; but to be
on a great horse like this, one that held
his head so high and stepped so carefully
where it was rough, and galloped so
lightly and easily where it was smooth&mdash;why,
she had never even dreamed of such
a magnificent ride. Not a word did she
speak, not even when the bishop began
to tell her that no gallows would be high
enough to hang such a wicked outlaw.
"You've stolen gold from the knights,"
said he, "you've stolen from the sheriff
of Nottingham, and you've even stolen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
from me. Glad am I to see Robin
Hood&mdash;but what's that?" the bishop
cried. "Who are those men, and who
is their leader? And who are you?"
he demanded of the merry little old
woman.</p>

<p>Now the little woman had been taught
to order herself lowly and reverently to
all her betters, so before she answered
the bishop she slipped down from the
tall white horse and made a deep curtsey
to the great man.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said she, "I
think it's Robin Hood and his men."</p>

<p>"And who are you?" he demanded
again.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm nobody but a little old
woman that lives in a cottage alone
and spins," and then she sang in a
lightsome little chirrup of a voice:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Monday I wash and Tuesday I iron,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wednesday I cook and I mend;</span><br />
Thursday I brew and Friday I sweep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And baking day brings the end."</span><br />
</div>

<p>I fear that the bishop did not hear
the little song, for the arrows were flying
thick and fast. The little old woman
slipped behind a big tree, and there she
danced her</p>

<div class='center'>
"Hey down, down, an a down!"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>to her heart's content, while the fighting
went on.</div>

<p>It was not long before the great bishop
was Robin's prisoner, and ere he could
go free, he had to open his strong leather
wallet and count out more gold than the
moon had shone on in the forest for
many and many a night. He laid down
the goldpieces one by one, and at every
piece he gave a groan that seemed to
come from the very bottom of his boots.</p>

<p>"That's for all the world like the cry
I heard from the little black pond to
the westward," said Little John. "It
wasn't like bird and it wasn't like
beast, and now I know what it was;
it was the soul of a stingy man, and he
had to count over and over the money
that he ought to have given away when
he was alive."</p>

<p>As for the merry little old woman,
she was a prisoner too, and such a time
as she had! First there was a bigger
feast than she had ever dreamed of before,
and every man of Robin's followers was
bound that she should eat the bit that
he thought was nicest. They made her
a little throne of soft green moss, and on
it they laid their hunting cloaks. They
built a shelter of fresh boughs over her
head, and then they sang songs to her.
They set up great torches all round
about the glade. They wrestled and
they vaulted and they climbed. They
played every game that could be played
by torchlight, and it was all to please the
kind little woman who had saved the
life of their master.</p>

<p>The merry little woman sat and
clapped her hands at all their feats, and
she laughed until she cried. Then she
wiped her eyes and sang them her one
little song.</p>

<p>The men shouted and cheered, and
cheered and shouted, and the woods
echoed so long and so loud that one would
have thought they, too, were trying to
shout.</p>

<p>By and by the company all set out
together to carry the little old woman
to her cottage. She was put upon their
very best and safest horse, and Robin
Hood would have none lead it but himself.
After the horse came a long line
of good bowmen and true. One carried
a new cloak of the finest wool. Another
bore a whole armful of silken kerchiefs
to make up for the one that Robin had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
worn away. There were "shoon and
hosen," and there was cloth of scarlet
and of blue, and there were soft, warm
blankets for her bed. There were so
many things that when they were all
piled up in the little cottage, there was
no chance for one tenth of the men to
get into the room. Those that were
outside pushed up to the window and
stretched their heads in at the door: and
they tried their best to pile up the great
heap of things so she could have room
to go to bed that night and to cook her
breakfast in the morning.</p>

<p>"And to-morrow's sweeping day,"
cried Robin. "'Thursday I brew and
Friday I sweep,' and how'll she sweep
if she has no floor?"</p>

<p>"We'll have to make her a floor,"
declared Friar Tuck.</p>

<p>"So we will," said Robin. "There's
a good man not far away who can work
in wood, and he shall come in the morning
and build her another room."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" cried the merry little old
woman with delight, "I never thought
I should have a house with two rooms;
but I'll always care for this room the
most, for there's just where Master
Robin stood when he came in at the door,
and there's where he sat when he was
spinning the flax. But, Master Robin,
Master Robin, did any one ever see
such a thread as you've left on the spool!"</p>

<p>It was so funny that the merry little
old woman really couldn't help jumping
up and dancing.</p>

<div class='center'>
"Hey down, down, an a down!"<br />
</div>

<p>And then the brave men and true all
said good-night and went back to the
forest.</p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_414" id="Note_414">414</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">All attempts to prove the historical existence
of Robin Hood have been unsuccessful.
His story has come down to us in a group
of old folk ballads, about forty in number,
dating from about the beginning of the
fifteenth century. One of these old ballads
is given below. They were sung to a
recurrent melody, which was as much a
part of them as the words of the story.
Other ballads in the group that are likely
to be very interesting to children are
"Robin Hood and Little John," "Robin
Hood and Maid Marian," "Robin Hood
Rescuing the Three Squires," "Robin
Hood's Death and Burial." The best
source for these ballads is Child's <i>English
and Scottish Popular Ballads</i> (ed. Sargent
and Kittredge). Tennyson dramatized the
Robin Hood story in <i>The Foresters</i>, as did
Alfred Noyes in <i>Sherwood</i>. Reginald De
Koven made a very successful comic opera
out of it, while Thomas Love Peacock's
<i>Maid Marian</i> is an interesting novelization
of the theme.</div>


<h4><br />ALLEN-A-DALE</h4>

<div class='poem'>
Come listen to me, you gallants so free,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All you that love mirth for to hear,</span><br />
And I will tell you of a bold outlaw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That lived in Nottinghamshire.</span><br />
<br />
As Robin Hood in the forest stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All under the greenwood tree,</span><br />
There was he ware of a brave young man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As fine as fine might be.</span><br />
<br />
The youngster was clothed in scarlet red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In scarlet fine and gay,</span><br />
And he did frisk it over the plain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And chanted a roundelay.</span><br />
<br />
As Robin Hood next morning stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amongst the leaves so gay,</span><br />
There did he spy the same young man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come drooping along the way.</span><br />
<br />
The scarlet he wore the day before,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was clean cast away;</span><br />
And every step he fetched a sigh,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alack! and well-a-day!"</span><br />
<br />
Then stepped forth brave Little John.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Nick, the miller's son,</span><br />
Which made the young man bend his bow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When as he saw them come.</span><br />
<br />
"Stand off! stand off!" the young man said;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What is your will with me?"</span><br />
"You must come before our master straight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under yon greenwood tree."</span><br />
<br />
And when he came bold Robin before,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Robin asked him courteously,</span><br />
"O hast thou any money to spare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For my merry men and me?"</span><br />
<br />
"I have no money," the young man said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But five shillings and a ring;</span><br />
And that I have kept this seven long years,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To have it at my wedding.</span><br />
<br />
"Yesterday I should have married a maid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she is now from me ta'en,</span><br />
And chosen to be an old knight's delight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereby my poor heart is slain."</span><br />
<br />
"What is thy name?" then said Robin Hood;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Come tell me without any fail."</span><br />
"By the faith of my body," then said the young man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My name it is Allen-a-Dale."</span><br />
<br />
"What wilt thou give me," said Robin Hood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"In ready gold or fee,</span><br />
To help thee to thy truelove again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And deliver her unto thee?"</span><br />
<br />
"I have no money," then quoth the young man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"No ready gold nor fee,</span><br />
But I will swear upon a book<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy true servant for to be."</span><br />
<br />
"How many miles is it to thy truelove?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come tell me without any guile:"</span><br />
"By the faith of my body," then said the young man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It is but five little mile."</span><br />
<br />
Then Robin he hasted over the plain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He did neither stint nor lin,</span><br />
Until he came unto the church<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Allen should keep his wedding.</span><br />
<br />
"What dost thou here?" the bishop he said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I prithee now tell to me"</span><br />
"I am a bold harper," quoth Robin Hood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And the best in the north country."</span><br />
<br />
"O welcome, O welcome," the bishop he said.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"That music best pleaseth me."</span><br />
"You shall have no music," quoth Robin Hood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Till the bride and bridegroom I see."</span><br />
<br />
With that came in a wealthy knight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which was both grave and old,</span><br />
And after him a finikin lass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did shine like glistering gold.</span><br />
<br />
"This is no fit match," quoth bold Robin Hood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"That you do seem to make here;</span><br />
For since we are come unto the church,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bride she shall choose her own dear."</span><br />
<br />
Then Robin Hood put his horn to his mouth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And blew blasts two or three;</span><br />
When four and twenty bowmen bold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came leaping over the lea.</span><br />
<br />
And when they came into the churchyard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Marching all in a row,</span><br />
The first man was Allen-a-Dale,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To give bold Robin his bow.</span><br />
<br />
"This is thy truelove," Robin he said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Young Allen, as I hear say;</span><br />
And you shall be married at this same time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before we depart away."</span><br />
<br />
"That shall not be," the bishop he said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For thy word shall not stand;</span><br />
They shall be three times asked in the church,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the law is of our land."</span><br />
<br />
Robin Hood pulled off the bishop's coat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And put it upon Little John;</span><br />
"By the faith of my body," then Robin said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"This cloth doth make thee a man."</span><br />
<br />
When Little John went into the choir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The people began for to laugh;</span><br />
He asked them seven times in the church,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lest three times should not be enough.</span><br />
<br />
"Who gives me this maid?" then said Little John;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quoth Robin, "That do I,</span><br />
And he that doth take her from Allen-a-Dale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full dearly he shall her buy."</span><br />
<br />
And thus having ended this merry wedding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bride looked as fresh as a queen,</span><br />
And so they returned to the merry greenwood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amongst the leaves so green.</span><br />

<h2>SECTION XI. BIOGRAPHY AND HERO STORIES</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p><i>Biography and its value.</i> The great charm of biography for both young and old
is in its perfect concreteness. Nothing fascinates like the story of a real person at
grips with realities. Nothing inspires like the story of a hard-won victory over difficulties.
Here are instances of men and women, our own kindred, facing great crises
in the physical or moral realm with the calm courage and the clear mind of which
we have dreamed. Here are others who have fought the brave fight in opposition
to the stupidities and long-entrenched prejudices of their fellows. Here are still
others who have wrested from nature her innermost secrets, who have won for us
immunity against lurking diseases and dangers, who have labored successfully against
great odds to make life more safe, more comfortable, or more beautiful. All these
records of real accomplishment appeal to the youthful spirit of emulation, and there
can be no stronger inspiration in facing the unsolved problems of the future. "What
men have done men can still do."</p>

<p><i>The material and its presentation.</i> Most teachers will find the biographical or
historical story easier to handle than the imaginative story, because there is a definite
outline of fact from which to work. Only those life stories with which the teacher
is in sympathy can be handled satisfactorily. For that reason no definite list of
suitable material is worth much, except as illustrating the wide range of choice.
Keeping these limitations in mind, we may venture a few practical hints:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. There is a large list of heroic figures hovering on the border line between
reality and legend of whose stories children never tire. In such a list are the
names of Leonidas, who held the pass at Thermopylae, William Tell and Arnold
von Winkelried, favorite heroes of Switzerland, Robert Bruce of Scotland, and
that pair of immortally faithful friends, Damon and Pythias.</p>

<p>2. With Marco Polo we may visit the wonderlands of the East, we may go
with Captain Cook through the islands of the southern seas, with Stanley through
darkest Africa, with the brave Scott in his tragic dash for the South Pole. Best
of all, perhaps, we may, with Columbus, discover another America.</p>

<p>3. How Elihu Burritt became the "learned blacksmith," how Hugh Miller
brought himself to be an authority on the old red sandstone, are always inspiring
stories to the ambitious student. And in any list of achievements by those
bound in by untoward circumstance must be placed that of Booker T. Washington
as told by himself in <i>Up from Slavery</i>.</p>

<p>4. From our earlier history we may draw upon such lives as those of Franklin,
Washington, and Patrick Henry. There are numberless stirring episodes from
the careers of Francis Marion, Israel Putnam, Nathan Hale, and others that
will occur to any reader of our history. Lincoln's life history offers an almost
inexhaustible treasure. Grant, grimly silent and persevering, and Lee, kindly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
gentleman and military genius, belong in any course that stresses our national
achievements.</p>

<p>5. Stories of men who have mastered the secrets of the forces of nature never
fail of interest. Stephenson and the locomotive engine, Sir Humphry Davy
and the safety lamp, Whitney and the cotton gin, Marconi and the wonders
of wireless communication, the Wright brothers and the airplane, Edison and
the incandescant light and the motion picture, Luther Burbank and his marvelous
work with plants&mdash;these are only a few to place near the head of any list.</p>

<p>6. Especially interesting for work in the grades are the stories of the pioneer
and plainsman days, of Kit Carson, Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone, and Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>7. We must not neglect stories of achievement by those who have been handicapped
by great physical disability, such as are found in the careers of Henry
Fawcett, the blind statesman of England, and of our own Helen Keller, whose
<i>Story of My Life</i> has become a classic source of material.</p>

<p>8. The life of Joan of Arc has long been a supreme favorite for biographical
story. Its simple directness, its fiery patriotism, its pathetic and tragic close,
give it all the force of some great consciously designed masterpiece. The events
of such a life can be arranged in a series or cycle of stories. Of very different
type, but of almost equally strong appeal, is the story of the work of Florence
Nightingale, whose efforts among the British soldiers in the terrible scenes of
the Crimean War set in motion those humanitarian enterprises so splendidly
exemplified in the work of the Red Cross organizations.</p>

<p>9. Finally, no teacher should fail to make use of many modern careers that
impress upon children the devotion of lives spent in bettering the conditions
under which people live. Among some of these may be mentioned Colonel
George E. Waring, the sanitary engineer who really cleaned the streets of New
York; General W. C. Gorgas, who led in the conquest of the great yellow fever
plague; Dr. Wilfred Grenfell, still spending his life for the natives of bleak
Labrador; and the famous French scientist, Louis Pasteur, who found out for
us how to preserve milk and how to escape the dread hydrophobia. Such careers
devoted to ameliorating the evils incident to civilization are of great value in
stirring into active existence the latent spirit of service in every pupil.</p>

<p>10. Wide-awake teachers will constantly find in the periodicals of the day
many episodes of achievement by men and women working in various fields of
helpfulness. Such present-day accomplishments should be emphasized. We
live in the present, and the duties and opportunities of the present are to furnish
the inspirations and indicate the fields of possible achievement for us.</p></div>


<h3><br />SUGGESTIONS FOR READING</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For a very practical discussion of biographical stories see Lyman, <i>Story Telling</i>, chap. v. The
great classic sources of inspiration on the subject are Carlyle, <i>Heroes and Hero Worship</i>, and Emerson,
<i>Representative Men</i>. Of special value is the opening chapter in the latter book, "Uses of Great
Men."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span></p>



<h3><br /><a name="Note_415" id="Note_415">415</a></h3>

<div class="hang1">Elbridge S. Brooks (1846-1902) was a well-known
American writer of juvenile books
on history, government, and biography.
His <i>True Story of Christopher Columbus</i>,
from which the following selection was
taken, is a well-written book that pupils
in the fifth and sixth grades read with
pleasure. <i>The Century Book for Young

<h4><br />HOW COLUMBUS GOT HIS SHIPS</h4>

<div class='center'>ELBRIDGE S. BROOKS</div>

<p>When Columbus was at school he had
studied about a certain man named
Pythagoras, who had lived in Greece
thousands of years before he was born,
and who had said that the earth was
round "like a ball or an orange." As
Columbus grew older and made maps
and studied the sea, and read books
and listened to what other people said,
he began to believe that this man named
Pythagoras might be right, and that
the earth was round, though everybody
declared it was flat. "If it is round,"
he said to himself, "what is the use of
trying to sail around Africa to get to
Cathay? Why not just sail west from
Italy or Spain and keep going right
around the world until you strike Cathay?
I believe it could be done," said Columbus.</p>

<p>By this time Columbus was a man.
He was thirty years old and was a great
sailor. He had been captain of a number
of vessels; he had sailed north and south
and east; he knew all about a ship and
all about the sea. But, though he was
a good sailor, when he said that he
believed the earth was round, everybody
laughed at him and said that he
was crazy. "Why, how can the earth
be round?" they cried. "The water
would all spill out if it were, and the
men who live on the other side would all
be standing on their heads with their
feet waving in the air." And then they
laughed all the harder.</p>

<p>But Columbus did not think it was
anything to laugh at. He believed it
so strongly and felt so sure that he was
right, that he set to work to find some
king or prince or great lord to let him
have ships and sailors and money enough
to try to find a way to Cathay by sailing
out into the West and across the Atlantic
Ocean.</p>

<p>Now this Atlantic Ocean, the western
waves of which break upon our rocks
and beaches, was thought in Columbus's
day to be a dreadful place. People called
it the Sea of Darkness, because they did
not know what was on the other side of
it, or what dangers lay beyond that
distant blue rim where the sky and
water seem to meet, and which we call
the horizon. They thought the ocean
stretched to the end of a flat world,
straight away to a sort of "jumping-off
place," and that in this jumping-off
place were giants and goblins and dragons
and monsters and all sorts of terrible
things that would catch the ships and
destroy them and the sailors.</p>

<p>So when Columbus said that he wanted
to sail away toward this dreadful jumping-off
place, the people said that he was
worse than crazy. They said he was a
wicked man and ought to be punished.</p>

<p>But they could not frighten Columbus.
He kept on trying. He went from place
to place trying to get the ships and sailors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
he wanted and was bound to have. As
you will see later, he tried to get help
wherever he thought it could be had.
He asked the people of his own home,
the city of Genoa, where he had lived
and played when a boy; he asked the
people of the beautiful city that is built
in the sea&mdash;Venice; he tried the king
of Portugal, the king of England, the
king of France, the king and queen of
Spain. But for a long time nobody
cared to listen to such a wild and foolish
and dangerous plan&mdash;to go to Cathay
by the way of the Sea of Darkness and
the jumping-off place. "You would
never get there alive," they said.</p>

<p>And so Columbus waited. And his
hair grew white while he waited, though
he was not yet an old man. He had
thought and worked and hoped so much
that he began to look like an old man
when he was forty years old. But still
he would never say that perhaps he was
wrong, after all. He said he knew he
was right, and that some day he should
find the Indies and sail to Cathay.</p>

<p>I do not wish you to think that
Columbus was the first man to say
that the earth was round, or the first
to sail to the West over the Atlantic
Ocean. He was not. Other men had
said that they believed the earth was
round; other men had sailed out into
the Atlantic Ocean. But no sailor who
believed the earth was round had ever
tried to prove that it was by crossing
the Atlantic. So, you see, Columbus
was really the first man to say, I believe
the earth is round and I will show you
that it is by sailing to the lands that
are on the other side of the earth.</p>

<p>He even figured out how far it was
around the world. Your geography, you
know, tells you now that what is called
the circumference of the earth&mdash;that is,
a straight line drawn right around it&mdash;is
nearly twenty-five thousand miles.
Columbus had figured it up pretty carefully
and he thought it was about twenty
thousand miles. "If I could start from
Genoa," he said, "and walk straight
ahead until I got back to Genoa again, I
should walk about twenty thousand
miles." Cathay, he thought, would take
up so much land on the other side of
the world that, if he went west instead
of east, he would only need to sail about
twenty-five hundred or three thousand
miles.</p>

<p>If you have studied your geography
carefully you will see what a mistake
he made.</p>

<p>It is really about twelve thousand miles
from Spain to China (or Cathay as he
called it). But America is just about
three thousand miles from Spain, and
if you read all this story you will see how
Columbus's mistake really helped him
to discover America.</p>

<p>I have told you that Columbus had a
longing to do something great from the
time when, as a little boy, he had hung
around the wharves in Genoa and looked
at the ships sailing east and west and
talked with the sailors and wished that
he could go to sea. Perhaps what he
had learned at school&mdash;how some men
said that the earth was round&mdash;and
what he had learned on the wharves
about the wonders of Cathay set him
to thinking and dreaming that it might
be possible for a ship to sail around the
world without falling off. At any rate,
he kept on thinking and dreaming and
longing until, at last, he began doing.</p>

<p>Some of the sailors sent out by Prince
Henry of Portugal, of whom I have
told you, in their trying to sail around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
Africa discovered two groups of islands
out in the Atlantic that they called the
Azores, or Isles of Hawks, and the Canaries,
or Isles of Dogs. When Columbus
was in Portugal in 1470 he became
acquainted with a young woman whose
name was Philippa Perestrelo. In 1473
he married her.</p>

<p>Now Philippa's father, before his
death, had been governor of Porto
Santo, one of the Azores, and Columbus
and his wife went off there to live. In
the governor's house Columbus found a
lot of charts and maps that told him
about parts of the ocean that he had
never before seen, and made him feel
certain that he was right in saying that
if he sailed away to the West he should
find Cathay.</p>

<p>At that time there was an old man who
lived in Florence, a city of Italy. His
name was Toscanelli. He was a great
scholar and studied the stars and made
maps, and was a very wise man. Columbus
knew what a wise old scholar Toscanelli
was, for Florence is not very far
from Genoa. So while he was living
in the Azores he wrote to this old scholar
asking him what he thought about his
idea that a man could sail around the
world until he reached the land called
the Indies and at last found Cathay.</p>

<p>Toscanelli wrote to Columbus saying
that he believed his idea was the right
one, and he said it would be a grand
thing to do, if Columbus dared to try
it. "Perhaps," he said, "you can find
all those splendid things that I know
are in Cathay&mdash;the great cities with
marble bridges, the houses of marble
covered with gold, the jewels and the
spices and the precious stones, and all
the other wonderful and magnificent
things. I do not wonder you wish to
try," he said, "for if you find Cathay
it will be a wonderful thing for you and
for Portugal."</p>

<p>That settled it with Columbus. If
this wise old scholar said he was right,
he must be right. So he left his home
in the Azores and went to Portugal.
This was in 1475, and from that time
on, for seventeen long years he was trying
to get some king or prince to help
him sail to the West to find Cathay.</p>

<p>But not one of the people who could
have helped him, if they had really
wished to, believed in Columbus. As
I told you, they said that he was crazy.
The king of Portugal, whose name was
John, did a very unkind thing&mdash;I am
sure you would call it a mean trick.
Columbus had gone to him with his
story and asked for ships and sailors.
The king and his chief men refused to
help him; but King John said to himself,
"Perhaps there is something in this
worth looking after and, if so, perhaps
I can have my own people find Cathay
and save the money that Columbus will
want to keep for himself as his share
of what he finds." So one day he copied
off the sailing directions that Columbus
had left with him, and gave them to
one of his own captains without letting
Columbus know anything about it. The
Portuguese captain sailed away to the
West in the direction Columbus had
marked down, but a great storm came
up and so frightened the sailors that they
turned around in a hurry. Then they
hunted up Columbus and began to abuse
him for getting them into such a scrape.
"You might as well expect to find land
in the sky," they said, "as in those
terrible waters."</p>

<p>And when, in this way, Columbus
found out that King John had tried to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
use his ideas without letting him know
anything about it, he was very angry.
His wife had died in the midst of this
mean trick of the Portuguese king, and
so, taking with him his little five-year-old
son, Diego, he left Portugal secretly
and went over into Spain.</p>

<p>Near the little town of Palos, in western
Spain, is a green hill looking out
toward the Atlantic. Upon this hill
stands an old building that, four hundred
years ago, was used as a convent or home
for priests. It was called the Convent
of Rabida, and the priest at the head
of it was named the Friar Juan Perez.
One autumn day, in the year 1484, Friar
Juan Perez saw a dusty traveler with a
little boy talking with the gate-keeper
of the convent. The stranger was so
tall and fine-looking, and seemed such
an interesting man, that Friar Juan
went out and began to talk with him.
This man was Columbus.</p>

<p>As they talked, the priest grew more
and more interested in what Columbus
said. He invited him into the convent
to stay for a few days, and he asked some
other people&mdash;the doctors of Palos and
some of the sea captains and sailors of
the town&mdash;to come and talk with this
stranger who had such a singular idea
about sailing across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>It ended in Columbus's staying some
months in Palos, waiting for a chance to
go and see the king and queen. At last,
in 1485, he set out for the Spanish court
with a letter to a priest who was a friend
of Friar Juan's, and who could help him
to see the king and queen.</p>

<p>At that time the king and queen of
Spain were fighting to drive out of Spain
the people called the Moors. These
people came from Africa, but they had
lived in Spain for many years and had
once been a very rich and powerful
nation. They were not Spaniards; they
were not Christians. So all Spaniards
and all Christians hated them and tried
to drive them out of Europe.</p>

<p>The king and queen of Spain who were
fighting the Moors were named Ferdinand
and Isabella. They were pretty good
people as kings and queens went in
those days, but they did a great many
very cruel and very mean things, just
as the kings and queens of those days
were apt to do. I am afraid we should
not think they were very nice people
nowadays. We certainly should not wish
our American boys and girls to look up
to them as good and true and noble.</p>

<p>When Columbus first came to them,
they were with the army in the camp
near the city of Cordova. The king and
queen had no time to listen to what they
thought were crazy plans, and poor
Columbus could get no one to talk with
him who could be of any help. So he
was obliged to go back to drawing maps
and selling books to make enough money
to support himself and his little Diego.</p>

<p>But at last, through the friend of good
Friar Juan Perez of Rabida, who was a
priest at the court, and named Talavera,
and to whom he had a letter of introduction,
Columbus found a chance to talk
over his plans with a number of priests
and scholars in the city of Salamanca
where there was a famous college and
many learned men.</p>

<p>Columbus told his story. He said
what he wished to do, and asked these
learned men to say a good word for him
to Ferdinand and Isabella so that he
could have the ships and sailors to sail
to Cathay. But it was of no use.</p>

<p>"What! sail away around the world?"
those wise men cried in horror. "Why,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
you are crazy! The world is not round;
it is flat. Your ships would tumble off
the edge of the world and all the king's
money and all the king's men would be
lost. No, no; go away; you must not
trouble the queen or even mention such
a ridiculous thing again."</p>

<p>So the most of them said. But one
or two thought it might be worth trying.
Cathay was a very rich country, and if
this foolish fellow were willing to run
the risk and did succeed, it would be a
good thing for Spain, as the king and
queen would need a great deal of money
after the war with the Moors was over.
At any rate, it was a chance worth
thinking about.</p>

<p>And so, although Columbus was dreadfully
disappointed, he thought that if
he had only a few friends at Court who
were ready to say a good word for him
he must not give up, but must try, try
again. And so he stayed in Spain.</p>

<p>When you wish very much to do a
certain thing, it is dreadfully hard to
be patient: it is harder still to have to
wait. Columbus had to do both. The
wars against the Moors were of much
greater interest to the king and queen
of Spain than was the finding of a
new and very uncertain way to get to
Cathay. If it had not been for the
patience and what we call the persistence
of Columbus, America would never have
been discovered&mdash;at least not in his
time.</p>

<p>He stayed in Spain. He grew poorer
and poorer. He was almost friendless.
It seemed as if his great enterprise must
be given up. But he never lost hope.
He never stopped trying. Even when
he failed, he kept on hoping and kept
on trying. He felt certain that sometime
he should succeed.</p>

<p>As we have seen, he tried to interest
the rulers of different countries, but
without success. He tried to get help
from his old home-town of Genoa and
failed; he tried Portugal and failed; he
tried the Republic of Venice and failed;
he tried the king and queen of Spain
and failed; he tried some of the richest
and most powerful of the nobles of
Spain and failed; he tried the king of
England (whom he got his brother,
Bartholomew Columbus, to see) and
failed. There was still left the king
of France. He would make one last
attempt to win the king and queen of
Spain to his side and if he failed with
them he would try the last of the rulers
of Western Europe, the king of France.</p>

<p>He followed the king and queen of
Spain as they went from place to place
fighting the Moors. He hoped that some
day, when they wished to think of something
besides fighting, they might think
of him and the gold and jewels and spices
of Cathay.</p>

<p>The days grew into months, the months
into years, and still the war against the
Moors kept on; and still Columbus
waited for the chance that did not come.
People grew to know him as "the crazy
explorer" as they met him in the streets
or on the church steps of Seville or Cordova,
and even ragged little boys of the
town, sharp-eyed and shrill-voiced as
such ragged little urchins are, would run
after this big man with the streaming
white hair and the tattered cloak, calling
him names or tapping their brown
little foreheads with their dirty fingers
to show that even they knew that he
was "as crazy as a loon."</p>

<p>At last he decided to make one more
attempt before giving it up in Spain.
His money was gone; his friends were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
few; but he remembered his acquaintances
at Palos and so he journeyed back
to see once more his good friend Friar
Juan Perez at the Convent of Rabida
on the hill that looked out upon the
Atlantic he was so anxious to cross.</p>

<p>It was in the month of November,
1491, that he went back to the Convent
of Rabida. If he could not get any
encouragement there, he was determined
to stay in Spain no longer but to go away
and try the king of France.</p>

<p>Once more he talked over the finding
of Cathay with the priests and the
sailors of Palos. They saw how patient
he was; how persistent he was; how he
would never give up his ideas until he
had tried them. They were moved
by his determination. They began to
believe in him more and more. They
resolved to help him. One of the principal
sea captains of Palos was named
Martin Alonso Pinzon. He became so
interested that he offered to lend Columbus
money enough to make one last
appeal to the king and queen of Spain,
and if Columbus should succeed with
them, this Captain Pinzon said he would
go into partnership with Columbus and
help him out when it came to getting
ready to sail to Cathay.</p>

<p>This was a move in the right direction.
At once a messenger was sent to the
splendid Spanish camp before the city
of Granada, the last unconquered city
of the Moors of Spain. The king and
queen of Spain had been so long trying
to capture Granada that this camp was
really a city, with gates and walls and
houses. It was called Santa F&eacute;. Queen
Isabella, who was in Santa F&eacute;, after
some delay, agreed to hear more about
the crazy scheme of this persistent
Genoese sailor, and the Friar Juan
Perez was sent for. He talked so well
in behalf of his friend Columbus that
the queen became still more interested.
She ordered Columbus to come and see
her, and sent him sixty-five dollars to
pay for a mule, a new suit of clothes,
and the journey to court.</p>

<p>About Christmas time, in the year
1491, Columbus, mounted upon his
mule, rode into the Spanish camp before
the city of Granada. But even now,
when he had been told to come, he had
to wait. Granada was almost captured;
the Moors were almost conquered. At
last the end came. On the second of
January, 1492, the Moorish king gave
up the keys of his beloved city, and the
great Spanish banner was hoisted on
the highest tower of the Alhambra&mdash;the
handsomest building in Granada and
one of the most beautiful in the world.
The Moors were driven out of Spain
and Columbus's chance had come.</p>

<p>So he appeared before Queen Isabella
and her chief men and told them again
of all his plans and desires. The queen
and her advisers sat in a great room in
that splendid Alhambra I have told
you of. King Ferdinand was not there.
He did not believe in Columbus and did
not wish to let him have money, ships,
or sailors to lose in such a foolish way.
But as Columbus stood before her and
talked so earnestly about how he expected
to find the Indies and Cathay and what
he hoped to bring away from there,
Queen Isabella listened and thought the
plan worth trying.</p>

<p>Then a singular thing happened. You
would think if you wished for something
very much that you would be willing to
give up a good deal for the sake of
getting it. Columbus had worked and
waited for seventeen years. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span>
never got what he wanted. He was
always being disappointed. And yet,
as he talked to the queen and told her
what he wished to do, he said he must
have so much as a reward for doing it
that the queen and her chief men were
simply amazed at his&mdash;well, what the
boys to-day call "cheek"&mdash;that they
would have nothing to do with him.
This man really is crazy, they said. This
poor Genoese sailor comes here without
a thing except his very odd ideas and
almost "wants the earth" as a reward.
This is not exactly what they said, but
it is what they meant.</p>

<p>His few friends begged him to be more
modest. "Do not ask so much," they
said, "or you will get nothing." But
Columbus was determined. "I have
worked and waited all these years," he
replied. "I know just what I can do
and just how much I can do for the king
and queen of Spain. They must pay
me what I ask and promise what I say,
or I will go somewhere else." "Go,
then!" said the queen and her advisers.
And Columbus turned his back on what
seemed almost his last hope, mounted
his mule, and rode away.</p>

<p>Then something else happened. As
Columbus rode off to find the French
king, sick and tired of all his long and
useless labor at the Spanish court, his
few firm friends there saw that, unless
they did something right away, all the
glory and all the gain of this enterprise
Columbus had taught them to believe in
would be lost to Spain. So two of them,
whose names were Santangel and Quintanilla,
rushed into the queen's room
and begged her, if she wished to become
the greatest queen in Christendom, to
call back this wandering sailor, agree to
his terms, and profit by his labors.</p>

<p>What if he does ask a great deal?
they said. He has spent his life thinking
his plan out; no wonder he feels that
he ought to have a good share of what
he finds. What he asks is really small
compared with what Spain will gain.
The war with the Moors has cost you
ever so much; your money chests are
empty; Columbus will fill them up.
The people of Cathay are heathen;
Columbus will help you make them
Christian men. The Indies and Cathay
are full of gold and jewels; Columbus
will bring you home shiploads of treasures.
Spain has conquered the Moors;
Columbus will help you conquer Cathay.</p>

<p>In fact, they talked to Queen Isabella
so strongly and so earnestly, that she,
too, became excited over this chance
for glory and riches that she had almost
lost. "Quick! send for Columbus. Call
him back!" said she. "I agree to his
terms. If King Ferdinand cannot or will
not take the risk, I, the queen, will do it
all. Quick! do not let the man get into
France. After him. Bring him back!"</p>

<p>And without delay a royal messenger,
mounted on a swift horse, was sent at
full gallop to bring Columbus back.</p>

<p>All this time poor Columbus felt bad
enough. Everything had gone wrong.
Now he must go away into a new land
and do it all over again. Kings and
queens, he felt, were not to be depended
upon, and he remembered a place in
the Bible where it said: "Put not your
trust in princes." Sad, solitary, and
heavy-hearted, he jogged slowly along
toward the mountains, wondering what
the king of France would say to him,
and whether it was really worth trying.</p>

<p>Just as he was riding across the little
bridge called the Bridge of Pinos, some
six miles from Granada, he heard the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
quick hoof-beats of a horse behind him.
It was a great spot for robbers, and
Columbus felt of the little money he
had in his traveling pouch, and wondered
whether he must lose it all. The hoof-beats
came nearer. Then a voice hailed
him. "Turn back, turn back!" the
messenger cried out. "The queen bids
you return to Granada. She grants
you all you ask."</p>

<p>Columbus hesitated. Ought he to
trust this promise, he wondered. Put
not your trust in princes, the verse in
the Bible had said. If I go back I may
only be put off and worried as I have
been before. And yet, perhaps she
means what she says. At any rate, I
will go back and try once more.</p>

<p>So, on the little Bridge of Pinos, he
turned his mule around and rode back
to Granada. And, sure enough, when
he saw Queen Isabella she agreed to all
that he asked. If he found Cathay,
Columbus was to be made admiral for
life of all the new seas and oceans into
which he might sail; he was to be chief
ruler of all the lands he might find; he
was to keep one tenth part of all the gold
and jewels and treasures he should bring
away, and was to have his "say" in all
questions about the new lands. For
his part (and this was because of the
offer of his friend at Palos, Captain
Pinzon) he agreed to pay one eighth of
all the expenses of this expedition and
of all new enterprises, and was to have
one eighth of all the profits from them.</p>

<p>So Columbus had his wish at last.
The queen's men figured up how much
money they could let him have; they
called him "Don Christopher Columbus,"
"Your Excellency," and "Admiral," and
at once he set about getting ready for
his voyage.</p>

<div class="hang1">Most children who read public library books
know something about the work of
Horace E. Scudder (1838-1902). For eight
years he was editor of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>,
but he is more widely known as a writer
and compiler of books for children. The
entertaining and informing <i>Bodley Books</i>
were widely read by a former generation
and are still decidedly worth reading.
Perhaps his most popular work is <i>The
Children's Book</i>, a collection of literature
suitable for the first four grades. Pupils
in the third, fourth, and fifth grades read
with pleasure <i>The Book of Fables</i>, <i>The Book
of Folk Stories</i>, <i>Fables and Folk Stories</i>, and
<i>The Book of Legends</i>. Mr. Scudder was
the leading advocate of introducing literature
into the schools at a time when such
advocacy was uphill work, and he edited
a great number of literary classics for
school use. He wrote a number of historical
and biographical works of value. <i>George
Washington</i>, from which the next selection
is taken, is considered by many to be
the best biography of Washington that
has been written for children. (The chapter

<h4><br />THE BOYHOOD OF WASHINGTON</h4>

<div class='center'>HORACE E. SCUDDER</div>

<p>It was near the shore of the Potomac
River, between Pope's Creek and
Bridge's Creek, that Augustine Washington
lived when his son George was
born. The land had been in the family
ever since Augustine's grandfather, John
Washington, had bought it, when he
came over from England in 1657. John
Washington was a soldier and a public-spirited
man, and so the parish in which
he lived&mdash;for Virginia was divided into
parishes as some other colonies into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
townships&mdash;was named Washington. It
is a quiet neighborhood; not a sign
remains of the old house, and the only
mark of the place is a stone slab, broken
and overgrown with weeds and brambles,
which lies on a bed of bricks taken from
the remnants of the old chimney of the
house. It bears the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Here</span><br />
The 11th of February, 1732 (old style)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">George Washington</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">was born</span><br />
</div>

<p>The English had lately agreed to use
the calendar of Pope Gregory, which
added eleven days to the reckoning, but
people still used the old style as well
as the new. By the new style, the birthday
was February 22, and that is the
day which is now observed. The family
into which the child was born consisted
of the father and mother, Augustine and
Mary Washington, and two boys, Lawrence
and Augustine. These were sons
of Augustine Washington by a former
wife who had died four years before.
George Washington was the eldest of
the children of Augustine and Mary
Washington; he had afterward three
brothers and two sisters, but one of the
sisters died in infancy.</p>

<p>It was not long after George Washington's
birth that the house in which
he was born was burned, and as his
father was at the time especially interested
in some iron-works at a distance,
it was determined not to rebuild upon
the lonely place. Accordingly Augustine
Washington removed his family
to a place which he owned in Stafford
County, on the banks of the Rappahannock
River opposite Fredericksburg. The
house is not now standing, but a picture
was made of it before it was destroyed.
It was, like many Virginia houses of the
day, divided into four rooms on a floor,
and had great outside chimneys at either
end.</p>

<p>Here George Washington spent his
childhood. He learned to read, write,
and cipher at a small school kept by
Hobby, the sexton of the parish church.
Among his playmates was Richard Henry
Lee, who was afterward a famous Virginian.
When the boys grew up, they
wrote to each other of grave matters of
war and state, but here is the beginning
of their correspondence, written when
they were nine years old:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">"Richard Henry Lee to George Washington:<br />

of pictures he got them in Alexandria
they have pictures of dogs and cats and

<div class="blockquot">"George Washington to Richard Henry

<p>"Dear Dickey I thank you very much
for the pretty picturebook you gave me.
Sam asked me to show him the pictures
and I showed him all the pictures in it;
and I read to him how the tame elephant
took care of the master's little boy, and
put him on his back and would not let
anybody touch his master's little son.
I can read three or four pages sometimes
without missing a word. Ma says I may
go to see you, and stay all day with you
next week if it be not rainy. She says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
I may ride my pony Hero if Uncle Ben
will go with me and lead Hero. I have a
little piece of poetry about the picture
book you gave me, but I mustn't tell
you who wrote the poetry.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"G. W.'s compliments to R. H. L.,<br />
And likes his book full well,<br />
Henceforth will count him his friend,<br />
And hopes many happy days he may spend.<br />
</div>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"Your good friend,</span><br />
"George Washington.<br /></div>

<p>"I am going to get a whip top soon,
and you may see it and whip it."</p></div>

<p>It looks very much as if Richard Henry
sent his letter off just as it was written.
I suspect that his correspondent's letter
was looked over, corrected, and copied
before it was sent. Very possibly Augustine
Washington was absent at the time
on one of his journeys; but at any rate
the boy owed most of his training to his
mother, for only two years after this his
father died, and he was left to his mother's
care.</p>

<p>She was a woman born to command,
and since she was left alone with a family
and an estate to care for, she took the
reins into her own hands, and never
gave them up to any one else. She used
to drive about in an old-fashioned open
chaise, visiting the various parts of her
farm, just as a planter would do on horseback.
The story is told that she had
given an agent directions how to do a
piece of work, and he had seen fit to do
it differently, because he thought his
way a better one. He showed her the
improvement.</p>

<p>"And pray," said the lady, "who gave
you any exercise of judgment in the
matter? I command you, sir; there is
nothing left for you but to obey."</p>

<p>In those days, more than now, a boy
used very formal language when addressing
his mother. He might love her
warmly, but he was expected to treat
her with a great show of respect. When
Washington wrote to his mother, even
after he was of age, he began his letter,
"Honored Madam," and signed it,
"Your dutiful son." This was a part
of the manners of the time. It was like
the stiff dress which men wore when
they paid their respects to others; it
was put on for the occasion, and one
would have been thought very unmannerly
who did not make a marked difference
between his every-day dress and
that which he wore when he went into
the presence of his betters. So Washington,
when he wrote to his mother,
would not be so rude as to say, "Dear
Mother."</p>

<p>Such habits as this go deeper than
mere forms of speech. I do not suppose
that the sons of this lady feared her,
but they stood in awe of her, which is
quite a different thing.</p>

<p>"We were all as mute as mice, when
in her presence," says one of Washington's
companions; and common report
makes her to have been very much such
a woman as her son afterward was a
man.</p>

<p>I think that George Washington owed
two strong traits to his mother&mdash;a
governing spirit and a spirit of order
and method. She taught him many
lessons and gave him many rules; but,
after all, it was her character shaping
his which was most powerful. She
taught him to be truthful, but her lessons
were not half so forcible as her own
truthfulness.</p>

<p>There is a story told of George Washington's
boyhood&mdash;unfortunately there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
are not many stories&mdash;which is to the
point. His father had taken a great
deal of pride in his blooded horses, and
his mother afterward took pains to keep
the stock pure. She had several young
horses that had not yet been broken,
and one of them in particular, a sorrel,
was extremely spirited. No one had
been able to do anything with it, and it
was pronounced thoroughly vicious, as
people are apt to pronounce horses which
they have not learned to master. George
was determined to ride this colt, and
told his companions that if they would
help him catch it, he would ride and
tame it.</p>

<p>Early in the morning they set out for
the pasture, where the boys managed to
surround the sorrel and then to put a
bit into its mouth. Washington sprang
upon its back, the boys dropped the
bridle, and away flew the angry animal.
Its rider at once began to command;
the horse resisted, backing about the
field, rearing and plunging. The boys
became thoroughly alarmed, but Washington
kept his seat, never once losing
his self-control or his mastery of the
colt. The struggle was a sharp one;
when suddenly, as if determined to rid
itself of its rider, the creature leaped
into the air with a tremendous bound.
It was its last. The violence burst a
blood-vessel, and the noble horse fell
dead.</p>

<p>Before the boys could sufficiently
recover to consider how they should
extricate themselves from the scrape,
they were called to breakfast; and the
mistress of the house, knowing that they
had been in the fields, began to ask
after her stock.</p>

<p>"Pray, young gentlemen," said she,
"have you seen my blooded colts in
your rambles? I hope they are well
taken care of. My favorite, I am told,
is as large as his sire."</p>

<p>The boys looked at one another, and
no one liked to speak. Of course the
mother repeated her question.</p>

<p>"The sorrel is dead, madam," said
her son. "I killed him!"</p>

<p>And then he told the whole story.
They say that his mother flushed with
anger, as her son often used to, and then,
like him, controlled herself, and presently
said, quietly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is well; but while I regret the
loss of my favorite, I rejoice in my son
who always speaks the truth."</p>

<p>The story of Washington's killing the
blooded colt is of a piece with other
stories less particular, which show that
he was a very athletic fellow. Of course,
when a boy becomes famous, every one
likes to remember the wonderful things
he did before he was famous; and
Washington's playmates, when they grew
up, used to show the spot by the Rappahannock,
near Fredericksburg, where he
stood and threw a stone to the opposite
bank; and at the celebrated Natural
Bridge, the arch of which is two hundred
feet above the ground, they always tell
the visitor that George Washington threw
a stone in the air the whole height. He
undoubtedly took part in all the sports
which were the favorites of his country
at that time&mdash;he pitched heavy bars,
tossed quoits, ran, leaped, and wrestled;
for he was a powerful, large-limbed young
fellow, and he had a very large and strong
hand.</p>

<h4><br />THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</h4>

<p>At ten years old I was taken home to
assist my father in his business, which
was that of a tallow-chandler and soap-boiler,
a business he was not bred to,
but had assumed on his arrival in New
England, and on finding his dyeing trade
would not maintain his family, being
in little request. Accordingly, I was
employed in cutting wick for the candles,
filling the dipping mold and the molds
for cast candles, attending the shop,
going of errands, etc.</p>

<p>I continued thus employed in my
father's business for two years, that is,
till I was twelve years old; and my
brother John, who was bred to that
business, having left my father, married,
and set up for himself at Rhode Island,
there was all appearance that I was
destined to supply his place, and become
a tallow-chandler. But my dislike to
the trade continuing, my father was
under apprehensions that if he did not
find one for me more agreeable, I should
break away and get to sea, as his son
Josiah had done, to his great vexation.
He therefore sometimes took me to walk
with him, and see joiners, bricklayers,
turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that
he might observe my inclination, and
endeavor to fix it on some trade or other
on land. It has ever since been a pleasure
to me to see good workmen handle
their tools; and it has been useful to
me, having learned so much by it as
to be able to do little jobs myself in
my house when a workman could not
readily be got, and to construct little
machines for my experiments, while the
intention of making the experiment was
fresh and warm in my mind. My
father at last fixed upon the cutler's
trade, and my uncle Benjamin's son
Samuel, who was bred to that business
in London, being about that time
established in Boston, I was sent to be
with him some time on liking. But his
expectations of a fee with me displeasing
my father, I was taken home again.</p>

<p>From a child I was fond of reading,
and all the little money that came into
my hands was ever laid out in books.
Pleased with the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, my
first collection was of John Bunyan's
works in separate little volumes. I
afterward sold them to enable me to
buy R. Burton's <i>Historical Collections</i>.
They were small chapmen's books, and
cheap, 40 or 50 in all. My father's
little library consisted chiefly of books
in polemic divinity, most of which I
read, and have since often regretted that,
at a time when I had such a thirst for
knowledge, more proper books had not
fallen in my way, since it was now
resolved I should not be a clergyman.
Plutarch's <i>Lives</i> there was in which I
read abundantly, and I still think that
time spent to great advantage. There
was also a book of De Foe's, called an
<i>Essay on Projects</i>, and another of Dr.
Mather's, called <i>Essays to do Good</i>, which
perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that
had an influence on some of the principal
future events of my life.</p>

<p>This bookish inclination at length
determined my father to make me a
printer, though he had already one son
(James) of that profession. In 1717
my brother James returned from England<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
with a press and letters to set up his
business in Boston. I liked it much
better than that of my father, but still
had a hankering for the sea. To prevent
the apprehended effect of such an
inclination, my father was impatient to
have me bound to my brother. I stood
out some time, but at last was persuaded,
and signed the indentures when I was
yet but twelve years old. I was to
serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one
years of age, only I was to be allowed
journeyman's wages during the last
year. In a little time I made great
proficiency in the business, and became
a useful hand to my brother. I now had
access to better books. An acquaintance
with the apprentices of booksellers
enabled me sometimes to borrow a small
one, which I was careful to return soon
and clean. Often I sat up in my room
reading the greatest part of the night,
when the book was borrowed in the
evening and to be returned early in the
morning, lest it should be missed or
wanted.</p>

<p>And after some time an ingenious
tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who
had a pretty collection of books, and
who frequented our printing-house, took
notice of me, invited me to his library,
and very kindly lent me such books
as I chose to read. I now took a fancy
to poetry, and made some little pieces;
my brother, thinking it might turn to
account, encouraged me, and put me
on composing occasional ballads. One
was called <i>The Lighthouse Tragedy</i>, and
contained an account of the drowning
of Captain Worthilake, with his two
daughters: the other was a sailor's song,
on the taking of <i>Teach</i> (or Blackbeard)
the pirate. They were wretched stuff,
in the Grub-street-ballad style; and
when they were printed he sent me
about the town to sell them. The first
sold wonderfully, the event being recent,
having made a great noise. This flattered
my vanity; but my father discouraged
me by ridiculing my performances,
and telling me verse-makers were
generally beggars. So I escaped being
a poet, most probably a very bad one;
but as prose writing has been of great
use to me in the course of my life, and
was a principal means of my advancement,
I shall tell you how, in such a
situation, I acquired what little ability
I have in that way.</p>

<p>There was another bookish lad in the
town, John Collins by name, with whom
I was intimately acquainted. We sometimes
disputed, and very fond we were
of argument, and very desirous of confuting
one another, which disputatious
turn, by the way, is apt to become a
very bad habit, making people often
extremely disagreeable in company by
the contradiction that is necessary to
bring it into practice; and thence, besides
souring and spoiling the conversation,
is productive of disgusts and, perhaps,
enmities where you may have occasion
for friendship. I had caught it by reading
my father's books of dispute about
religion. Persons of good sense, I have
since observed, seldom fall into it, except
lawyers, university men, and men of all
sorts that have been bred at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>A question was once, somehow or
other, started between Collins and me,
of the propriety of educating the female
sex in learning, and their abilities for
study. He was of opinion that it was
improper, and that they were naturally
unequal to it. I took the contrary side,
perhaps a little for dispute's sake. He
was naturally more eloquent, had a ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
plenty of words; and sometimes, as I
thought, bore me down more by his
fluency than by the strength of his
reasons. As we parted without settling
the point, and were not to see one
another again for some time, I sat down
to put my arguments in writing, which
I copied fair and sent to him. He
answered, and I replied. Three or four
letters of a side had passed, when my
father happened to find my papers and
read them. Without entering into the
discussion, he took occasion to talk to
me about the manner of my writing;
observed that, though I had the advantage
of my antagonist in correct spelling
and pointing (which I owed to the
printing-house), I fell far short in elegance
of expression, in method and in
perspicuity, of which he convinced me
by several instances. I saw the justice
of his remarks, and thence grew more
attentive to the manner in writing, and
determined to endeavor at improvement.</p>

<p>About this time I met with an odd
volume of the <i>Spectator</i>. It was the
third. I had never before seen any of
them. I bought it, read it over and
over, and was much delighted with it.
I thought the writing excellent, and
wished, if possible, to imitate it. With
this view I took some of the papers, and,
making short hints of the sentiment in
each sentence, laid them by a few days,
and then, without looking at the book,
tried to complete the papers again, by
expressing each hinted sentiment at
length, and as fully as it had been
expressed before, in any suitable words
that should come to hand. Then I compared
my <i>Spectator</i> with the original, discovered
some of my faults, and corrected
them. But I found I wanted a stock
of words, or a readiness in recollecting
and using them, which I thought I
should have acquired before that time
if I had gone on making verses; since
the continual occasion for words of the
same import, but of different length, to
suit the measure, or of different sound
for the rhyme, would have laid me under
a constant necessity of searching for
variety, and also have tended to fix that
variety in my mind, and make me master
of it. Therefore I took some of the
tales and turned them into verse; and,
after a time, when I had pretty well
forgotten the prose, turned them back
again. I also sometimes jumbled my
collections of hints into confusion, and
after some weeks endeavored to reduce
them into the best order, before I began
to form the full sentences and complete
the paper. This was to teach me method
in the arrangement of thoughts. By
comparing my work afterwards with the
original, I discovered many faults and
amended them; but I sometimes had
the pleasure of fancying that, in certain
particulars of small import, I had been
lucky enough to improve the method or
the language, and this encouraged me to
think I might possibly in time come to
be a tolerable English writer, of which
I was extremely ambitious. My time
for these exercises and for reading was
at night, after work or before it began
in the morning, or on Sundays, when I
contrived to be in the printing-house
alone, avoiding as much as I could the
common attendance on public worship
which my father used to exact of me
when I was under his care, and which
indeed I still thought a duty, though I
could not, as it seemed to me, afford time
to practice it.</p>

<p>When about 16 years of age I happened
to meet with a book, written by one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet.
I determined to go into it. My brother,
being yet unmarried, did not keep house,
but boarded himself and his apprentices
in another family. My refusing to eat
flesh occasioned an inconveniency, and
I was frequently chid for my singularity.
I made myself acquainted with Tryon's
manner of preparing some of his dishes,
such as boiling potatoes or rice, making
hasty pudding, and a few others, and then
proposed to my brother, that if he would
give me, weekly, half the money he paid
for my board, I would board myself.
He instantly agreed to it, and I presently
found that I could save half what he
paid me. This was an additional fund
for buying books. But I had another
advantage in it. My brother and the
rest going from the printing-house to
their meals, I remained there alone, and,
dispatching presently my light repast,
which often was no more than a biscuit
or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins
or a tart from the pastry-cook's, and a
glass of water, had the rest of the time
till their return for study, in which I
made the greater progress, from that
greater clearness of head and quicker
apprehension which usually attend temperance
in eating and drinking.</p>

<p>And now it was that, being on some
occasion made ashamed of my ignorance
in figures, which I had twice failed in
learning when at school, I took Cocker's
book of arithmetic, and went through
the whole by myself with great ease. I
also read Seller's and Shermy's books of
navigation, and became acquainted with
the little geometry they contain; but
never proceeded far in that science. And
I read about this time Locke <i>On Human
Understanding</i>, and the <i>Art of Thinking</i>,
by Messrs. du Port Royal.</p>

<p>While I was intent on improving my
language, I met with an English grammar
(I think it was Greenwood's), at the end
of which there were two little sketches
of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the
latter finishing with a specimen of a
dispute in the Socratic method; and
soon after I procured Xenophon's <i>Memorable
Things of Socrates</i>, wherein there
are many instances of the same method.
I was charmed with it, adopted it,
dropped my abrupt contradiction and
positive argumentation, and put on the
humble inquirer and doubter. And being
then, from reading Shaftesbury and
Collins, become a real doubter in many
points of our religious doctrine, I found
this method safest for myself and very
embarrassing to those against whom I
used it; therefore I took a delight in
it, practiced it continually, and grew
very artful and expert in drawing people,
even of superior knowledge, into concessions,
the consequences of which they
did not foresee, entangling them in
difficulties out of which they could not
extricate themselves, and so obtaining
victories that neither myself nor my
cause always deserved. I continued this
method some few years, but gradually
left it, retaining only the habit of expressing
myself in terms of modest diffidence;
never using, when I advanced any thing
that may possibly be disputed, the words
<i>certainly</i>, <i>undoubtedly</i>, or any others that
give the air of positiveness to an opinion;
but rather say, I conceive or apprehend a
thing to be so and so; it appears to me,
or <i>I should think it so or so</i>, for such and
such reasons; or <i>I imagine it to be so;</i>
or <i>it is so, if I am not mistaken</i>. This
habit, I believe, has been of great advantage
to me when I have had occasion
to inculcate my opinion, and persuade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
men into measures that I have been
from time to time engaged in promoting;
and, as the chief ends of conversation
are to <i>inform</i> or to be <i>informed</i>,
to <i>please</i> or to <i>persuade</i>, I wish well-meaning,
sensible men would not lessen
their power of doing good by a positive,
assuming manner, that seldom fails to
disgust, tends to create opposition, and
to defeat every one of those purposes
for which speech was given to us, to
wit, giving or receiving information or
pleasure. For, if you would inform,
a positive and dogmatical manner in
advancing your sentiments may provoke
contradiction and prevent a candid
attention. If you wish information and
improvement from the knowledge of
others, and yet at the same time express
yourself as firmly fixed in your present
opinions, modest, sensible men, who do
not love disputation, will probably leave
you undisturbed in the possession of
your error. And by such a manner, you
can seldom hope to recommend yourself
in <i>pleasing</i> your hearers, or to persuade
those whose concurrence you desire.
Pope says, judiciously:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Men should be taught as if you taught them not,<br />
And things unknown propos'd as things forgot";<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>farther recommending to us</div>

<div class='poem'>
"To speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>And he might have coupled with this
line that which he has coupled with
another, I think, less properly:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"For want of modesty is want of sense."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>If you ask, Why less properly? I must
repeat the lines:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Immodest words admit of no defense,<br />
For want of modesty is want of sense."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Now, is not <i>want of sense</i> (where a man
is so unfortunate as to want it) some
apology for his <i>want of modesty?</i> and
would not the lines stand more justly
thus?</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Immodest words admit <i>but</i> this defense,<br />
That want of modesty is want of sense."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>This, however, I should submit to better

<p>My brother had, in 1720 or 1721,
begun to print a newspaper. It was the
second that appeared in America, and
was called the <i>New England Courant</i>.
The only one before it was the <i>Boston
News-Letter</i>. I remember his being dissuaded
by some of his friends from the
undertaking, as not likely to succeed,
one newspaper being, in their judgment,
enough for America. At this time (1771)
there are not less than five-and-twenty.
He went on, however, with the undertaking,
and after having worked in composing
the types and printing off the
sheets, I was employed to carry the papers
through the streets to the customers.</p>

<p>He had some ingenious men among
his friends, who amused themselves by
writing little pieces for this paper, which
gained it credit and made it more in
demand, and these gentlemen often
visited us. Hearing their conversations,
and their accounts of the approbation
their papers were received with, I was
excited to try my hand among them; but,
being still a boy, and suspecting that
my brother would object to printing
any thing of mine in his paper if he
knew it to be mine, I contrived to disguise
my hand, and, writing an anonymous
paper, I put it in at night under
the door of the printing-house. It was
found in the morning, and communicated
to his writing friends when they called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
in as usual. They read it, commented
on it in my hearing, and I had the exquisite
pleasure of finding it met with their
approbation, and that, in their different
guesses at the author, none were named
but men of some character among us
for learning and ingenuity. I suppose
now that I was rather lucky in my
judges and that perhaps they were not
really so very good ones as I then
esteemed them.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I then thought of going to New York,
as the nearest place where there was a
printer; and I was rather inclined to
leave Boston when I reflected that I
had already made myself a little obnoxious
to the governing party, and, from
the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly
in my brother's case, it was likely I
might, if I stayed, soon bring myself
into scrapes; and farther, that my indiscrete
disputations about religion began
to make me pointed at with horror by
good people as an infidel or atheist. I
determined on the point, but my father
now siding with my brother, I was
sensible that, if I attempted to go openly,
means would be used to prevent me.
My friend Collins, therefore, undertook
to manage a little for me. He agreed
with the captain of a New York sloop
for my passage, under the notion of my
being a young acquaintance of his, that
had got into trouble, and therefore could
not appear or come away publicly. So
I sold some of my books to raise a little
money, was taken on board privately,
and as we had a fair wind, in three days
I found myself in New York, near 300
miles from home, a boy of but 17, without
the least recommendation to, or
knowledge of any person in the place,
and with very little money in my pocket.</p>

<p>My inclinations for the sea were by
this time worn out, or I might now have
gratified them. But, having a trade,
and supposing myself a pretty good
workman, I offered my service to the
printer in the place, old Mr. William
Bradford, who had been the first printer
in Pennsylvania, but removed from
thence upon the quarrel of George Keith.
He could give me no employment, having
little to do, and help enough already;
but says he, "My son at Philadelphia
has lately lost his principal hand, Aquila
Rose, by death; if you go thither, I
believe he may employ you." Philadelphia
was a hundred miles further;
I set out, however, in a boat for Amboy,
leaving my chest and things to follow
me round by sea.</p>

<p>In crossing the bay, we met with a
squall that tore our rotten sails to pieces,
prevented our getting into the Kill, and
drove us upon Long Island. On our
way, a drunken Dutchman, who was a
passenger too, fell overboard; when he
was sinking, I reached through the water
to his shock pate, and drew him up, so
that we got him in again. His ducking
sobered him a little, and he went to
sleep, taking first out of his pocket a
book, which he desired I would dry for
him. It proved to be my old favorite
author, Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, in
Dutch, finely printed on good paper,
with copper cuts, a dress better than I
had ever seen it wear in its own language.
I have since found that it has been
translated into most of the languages of
Europe, and suppose it has been more
generally read than any other book,
except perhaps the Bible. Honest John
was the first that I know of who mixed
narration and dialogue; a method of
writing very engaging to the reader, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
in the most interesting parts finds himself,
as it were, brought into the company
and present at the discourse. De Foe
in his <i>Crusoe</i>, his <i>Moll Flanders</i>, <i>Religious
Courtship</i>, <i>Family Instructor</i>, and
other pieces, has imitated it with success;
and Richardson has done the same in
his <i>Pamela</i>, etc.</p>

<p>When we drew near the island, we
found it was at a place where there could
be no landing, there being a great surf
on the stony beach. So we dropped
anchor, and swung around towards the
shore. Some people came down to the
water edge and hallooed to us, as we
did to them; but the wind was so high,
and the surf so loud, that we could not
hear so as to understand each other.
There were canoes on the shore, and we
made signs, and hallooed that they
should fetch us; but they either did not
understand us, or thought it impracticable,
so they went away, and night
coming on, we had no remedy but to
wait till the wind should abate; and, in
the meantime, the boatman and I concluded
to sleep, if we could; and so
crowded into the scuttle, with the Dutchman,
who was still wet, and the spray
beating over the head of our boat, leaked
through to us, so that we were soon almost
as wet as he. In this manner we lay all
night, with very little rest; but, the wind
abating the next day, we made a shift
to reach Amboy before night, having
been thirty hours on the water, without
victuals, or any drink but a bottle of
filthy rum, the water we sailed on being
salt.</p>

<p>In the evening I found myself very
feverish, and went in to bed; but, having
read somewhere that cold water drunk
plentifully was good for a fever, I followed
the prescription, sweat plentifully most
of the night, my fever left me, and in
the morning, crossing the ferry, I proceeded
on my journey on foot, having
fifty miles to Burlington, where I was
told I should find boats that would carry
me the rest of the way to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It rained very hard all the day; I
was thoroughly soaked, and by noon a
good deal tired; so I stopped at a poor
inn, where I stayed all night, beginning
now to wish that I had never left home.
I cut so miserable a figure, too, that I
found, by the questions asked me, I was
suspected to be some runaway servant,
and in danger of being taken up on that
suspicion. However, I proceeded the
next day, and got in the evening to an
inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington,
kept by one Dr. Brown. He entered
into conversation with me while I took
some refreshment, and, finding I had
read a little, became very sociable and
friendly. Our acquaintance continued
as long as he lived. He had been, I
imagine, an itinerant doctor, for there
was no town in England, or country in
Europe, of which he could not give a very
particular account. He had some letters,
and was ingenious, but much of an
unbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some
years after, to travesty the Bible in
doggerel verse, as Cotton had done
Virgil. By this means he set many of
the facts in a very ridiculous light, and
might have hurt weak minds if his
work had been published; but it never
was.</p>

<p>At his house I lay that night, and the
next morning reached Burlington, but
had the mortification to find that the
regular boats were gone a little before
my coming, and no other expected to go
before Tuesday, this being Saturday;
wherefore I returned to an old woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
in the town, of whom I had bought
gingerbread to eat on the water, and
asked her advice. She invited me to
lodge at her house till a passage by water
should offer; and being tired with my
foot traveling, I accepted the invitation.
She understanding I was a printer, would
have had me stay at that town and
follow my business, being ignorant of
the stock necessary to begin with. She
was very hospitable, gave me a dinner
of ox-cheek with great good will, accepting
only of a pot of ale in return; and I
thought myself fixed till Tuesday should
come. However, walking in the evening
by the side of the river, a boat came by,
which I found was going towards Philadelphia,
with several people in her. They
took me in, and, as there was no wind,
we rowed all the way; and about midnight,
not having yet seen the city, some
of the company were confident we must
have passed it, and would row no farther;
the others knew not where we were; so
we put toward the shore, got into a
creek, landed near an old fence, with
the rails of which we made a fire, the
night being cold, in October, and there
we remained till daylight. Then one of
the company knew the place to be
Cooper's Creek, a little above Philadelphia,
which we saw as soon as we got
out of the creek, and arrived there about
eight or nine o'clock on the Sunday
morning, and landed at the Market
Street wharf.</p>

<p>I have been the more particular in
this description of my journey, and shall
be so of my first entry into that city,
that you may in your mind compare
such unlikely beginnings with the figure
I have since made there. I was in my
working dress, my best clothes being to
come round by sea. I was dirty from
my journey; my pockets were stuffed
out with shirts and stockings, and I
knew no soul nor where to look for
lodging. I was fatigued with traveling,
rowing, and want of rest; I was very
hungry; and my whole stock of cash
consisted of a Dutch dollar and about a
shilling in copper. The latter I gave the
people of the boat for my passage, who
at first refused it, on account of my
rowing; but I insisted on their taking it.
A man being sometimes more generous
when he has but a little money than
when he has plenty, perhaps through
fear of being thought to have but little.</p>

<p>Then I walked up the street, gazing
about till near the market-house I met
a boy with bread. I had made many a
meal on bread, and, inquiring where he
got it, I went immediately to the baker's
he directed me to, in Second Street, and
asked for biscuit, intending such as we
had in Boston; but they, it seems, were
not made in Philadelphia. Then I asked
for a three-penny loaf, and was told they
had none such. So not considering or
knowing the difference of money, and
the greater cheapness nor the names of
his bread, I bade him give me three-penny
worth of any sort. He gave me,
accordingly, three great puffy rolls. I
was surprised at the quantity, but took
it, and, having no room in my pockets,
walked off with a roll under each arm,
and eating the other. Thus I went up
Market Street as far as Fourth Street,
passing by the door of Mr. Read, my
future wife's father; when she, standing
at the door, saw me, and thought I made,
as I certainly did, a most awkward,
ridiculous appearance. Then I turned
and went down Chestnut Street and
part of Walnut Street, eating my roll
all the way, and, coming round, found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
myself again at Market Street wharf,
near the boat I came in, to which I went
for a draught of the river water; and,
being filled with one of my rolls, gave
the other two to a woman and her child
that came down the river in the boat
with us, and were waiting to go farther.</p>

<p>Thus refreshed, I walked again up
the street, which by this time had many
clean-dressed people in it, who were all
walking the same way. I joined them,
and thereby was led into the great
meeting-house of the Quakers near the
market. I sat down among them, and,
after looking round awhile and hearing
nothing said, being very drowsy through
labor and want of rest the preceding
night, I fell fast asleep, and continued
so till the meeting broke up, when one
was kind enough to rouse me. This
was, therefore, the first house I was in,
or slept in, in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Walking down again toward the river,
and, looking in the faces of people, I
met a young Quaker man, whose countenance
I liked, and, accosting him,
requested he would tell me where a
stranger could get lodging. We were
then near the sign of the Three Mariners.
"Here," says he, "is one place that
entertains strangers, but it is not a
reputable house; if thee wilt walk with
me I'll show thee a better." He brought
me to the Crooked Billet, in Water
Street. Here I got a dinner; and, while
I was eating it, several sly questions were
asked me, as it seemed to be suspected
from my youth and appearance that I
might be some runaway.</p>

<p>After dinner my sleepiness returned,
and being shown to a bed, I lay down
without undressing, and slept till six
in the evening, was called to supper,
went to bed again very early, and slept
soundly till next morning. Then I made
myself as tidy as I could, and went to
Andrew Bradford the printer's. I found
in the shop the old man his father, whom
I had seen at New York, and who,
traveling on horseback, had got to
Philadelphia before me. He introduced
me to his son, who received me civilly,
gave me a breakfast, but told me he
did not at present want a hand, being
lately supplied with one; but there was
another printer in town, lately set up,
one Keimer, who, perhaps, might employ
me; if not, I should be welcome to lodge
at his house, and he would give me a
little work to do now and then till fuller
business should offer.</p>

<p>The old gentleman said he would go
with me to the new printer; and when
we found him, "Neighbor," says Bradford,
"I have brought to see you a young
man of your business; perhaps you may
want such a one." He asked me a few
questions, put a composing stick in my
hand to see how I worked, and then said
he would employ me soon, though he
had just then nothing for me to do; and,
taking old Bradford, whom he had never
seen before, to be one of the townspeople
that had a good will for him, entered
into a conversation on his present undertaking
and prospects; while Bradford,
not discovering that he was the other
printer's father, on Keimer's saying he
expected soon to get the greatest part
of the business into his own hands, drew
him on by artful questions, and starting
little doubts, to explain all his views,
what interest he relied on, and in what
manner he intended to proceed. I, who
stood by and heard all, saw immediately
that one of them was a crafty old sophister,
and the other a mere novice.
Bradford left me with Keimer, who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
greatly surprised when I told him who
the old man was.</p>

<p>Keimer's printing-house, I found, consisted
of an old shattered press and one
small, worn-out font of English, which
he was then using himself, composing
an Elegy on Aquila Rose, before mentioned,
an ingenious young man, of
excellent character, much respected in
the town, clerk of the Assembly, and a
pretty poet. Keimer made verses too,
but very indifferently. He could not be
said to write them, for his manner was
to compose them in the types directly
out of his head. So there being no
copy, but one pair of cases, and the
Elegy likely to require all the letters, no
one could help him. I endeavored to
put his press (which he had not yet used
and of which he understood nothing)
into order fit to be worked with; and,
promising to come and print off his
Elegy as soon as he should have got it
ready, I returned to Bradford's, who
gave me a little job to do for the present,
and there I lodged and dieted. A few
days after, Keimer sent for me to print
off the Elegy. And now he had got
another pair of cases, and a pamphlet
to reprint, on which he set me to work.</p>

<p>These two printers I found poorly
qualified for their business. Bradford
had not been bred to it, and was very
illiterate; and Keimer, though something
of a scholar, was a mere compositor,
knowing nothing of presswork. He had
been one of the French prophets, and
could act their enthusiastic agitations.
At this time he did not profess any
particular religion, but something of all
on occasion; was very ignorant of the
world, and had, as I afterward found, a
good deal of the knave in his composition.
He did not like my lodging at Bradford's
while I worked with him. He had a
house, indeed, but without furniture, so
he could not lodge me; but he got me
a lodging at Mr. Read's, before mentioned,
who was the owner of his house;
and, my chest and clothes being come by
this time, I made rather a more respectable
appearance in the eyes of Miss
Read than I had done when she first
happened to see me eating my roll in
the street.</p>

<div class="hang1">Of the numerous biographies of Abraham
Lincoln, none seems better suited for use

Lincoln</i>, by Helen Nicolay (1866&mdash;),
from which the next selection was taken.
John George Nicolay, father of Helen
Nicolay, was private secretary to Abraham
Lincoln from 1860 to 1865, and later he
wrote an excellent biography of Lincoln.
(The following selection is used by permission

York.)</div>


<h4><br />LINCOLN'S EARLY DAYS</h4>

<div class='center'>HELEN NICOLAY</div>

<p>The story of this wonderful man
begins and ends with a tragedy, for his
grandfather, also named Abraham, was
killed by a shot from an Indian's rifle
while peaceably at work with his three
sons on the edge of their frontier clearing.
Eighty-one years later the President
himself met death by an assassin's bullet.
The murderer of one was a savage of the
forest; the murderer of the other that far
more cruel thing, a savage of civilization.</p>

<p>When the Indian's shot laid the pioneer
farmer low, his second son, Josiah, ran
to a neighboring fort for help, and
Mordecai, the eldest, hurried to the
cabin for his rifle. Thomas, a child of
six years, was left alone beside the dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
body of his father; and as Mordecai
snatched the gun from its resting-place
over the door of the cabin, he saw, to
his horror, an Indian in his war-paint,
just stooping to seize the child. Taking
quick aim at a medal on the breast of
the savage, he fired, and the Indian fell
dead. The little boy, thus released,
ran to the house, where Mordecai, firing
through the loopholes, kept the Indians
at bay until help arrived from the fort.</p>

<p>It was this child Thomas who grew up
to be the father of President Abraham
Lincoln. After the murder of his father
the fortunes of the little family grew
rapidly worse, and doubtless because of
poverty, as well as by reason of the
marriage of his older brothers and sisters,
their home was broken up, and Thomas
found himself, long before he was grown,
a wandering laboring boy. He lived for
a time with an uncle as his hired servant,
and later he learned the trade of carpenter.
He grew to manhood entirely without
education, and when he was twenty-eight
years old could neither read nor
write. At that time he married Nancy
Hanks, a good-looking young woman of
twenty-three, as poor as himself, but so
much better off as to learning that she
was able to teach her husband to sign
his own name. Neither of them had
any money, but living cost little on the
frontier in those days, and they felt
that his trade would suffice to earn all
that they should need. Thomas took
his bride to a tiny house in Elizabethtown,
Kentucky, where they lived for
about a year, and where a daughter was
born to them.</p>

<p>Then they moved to a small farm
thirteen miles from Elizabethtown, which
they bought on credit, the country being
yet so new that there were places to be
had for mere promises to pay. Farms
obtained on such terms were usually of
very poor quality, and this one of Thomas
Lincoln's was no exception to the rule.
A cabin ready to be occupied stood on
it, however; and not far away, hidden
in a pretty clump of trees and bushes,
was a fine spring of water, because of
which the place was known as Rock
Spring Farm. In the cabin on this farm
the future President of the United States
was born on February 12, 1809, and here
the first four years of his life were spent.
Then the Lincolns moved to a much
bigger and better farm on Knob Creek,
six miles from Hodgensville, which
Thomas Lincoln bought, again on credit,
selling the larger part of it soon afterward
to another purchaser. Here they
remained until Abraham was seven
years old.</p>

<p>About this early part of his childhood
almost nothing is known. He
never talked of these days, even to his
most intimate friends. To the pioneer
child a farm offered much that a town
lot could not give him&mdash;space; woods
to roam in; Knob Creek with its running
water and its deep, quiet pools for a
playfellow; berries to be hunted for in
summer and nuts in autumn; while all
the year round birds and small animals
pattered across his path to people the
solitude in place of human companions.
The boy had few comrades. He wandered
about playing his lonesome little
games, and, when these were finished,
returned to the small and cheerless
cabin. Once, when asked what he
remembered about the War of 1812
with Great Britain, he replied: "Only
this: I had been fishing one day and
had caught a little fish, which I was
taking home. I met a soldier in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
road, and having always been told at
home that we must be good to soldiers,
I gave him my fish." It is only a glimpse
into his life, but it shows the solitary,
generous child, and the patriotic household.</p>

<p>It was while living on this farm that
Abraham and his sister Sarah first began
going to A-B-C schools. Their earliest
teacher was Zachariah Riney, who taught
near the Lincoln cabin; the next was
Caleb Hazel, four miles away.</p>

<p>In spite of the tragedy that darkened
his childhood, Thomas Lincoln seems to
have been a cheery, indolent, good-natured
man. By means of a little farming
and occasional jobs at his trade, he
managed to supply his family with the
absolutely necessary food and shelter,
but he never got on in the world. He
found it much easier to gossip with his
friends, or to dream about rich new
lands in the West, than to make a thrifty
living in the place where he happened
to be. The blood of the pioneer was in
his veins too&mdash;the desire to move westward;
and hearing glowing accounts of
the new territory of Indiana, he resolved
to go and see it for himself. His skill as
a carpenter made this not only possible
but reasonably cheap, and in the fall of
1816 he built himself a little flatboat,
launched it half a mile from his cabin,
at the mouth of Knob Creek on the
waters of the Rolling Fork, and floated
on it down that stream to Salt River,
down Salt River to the Ohio, and down
the Ohio to a landing called Thompson's
Ferry on the Indiana shore.</p>

<p>Sixteen miles out from the river, near
a small stream known as Pigeon Creek,
he found a spot in the forest that suited
him; and as his boat could not be made
to float upstream, he sold it, stored his
goods with an obliging settler, and
trudged back to Kentucky, all the way
on foot, to fetch his wife and children&mdash;Sarah,
who was now nine years old, and
Abraham, seven. This time the journey
to Indiana was made with two horses,
used by the mother and children for
riding, and to carry their little camping
outfit for the night. The distance from
their old home was, in a straight line,
little more than fifty miles, but they had
to go double that distance because of
the very few roads it was possible to
follow.</p>

<p>Reaching the Ohio River and crossing
to the Indiana shore, Thomas Lincoln
hired a wagon which carried his family
and their belongings the remaining sixteen
miles through the forest to the spot
he had chosen&mdash;a piece of heavily wooded
land, one and a half miles east of what
has since become the village of Gentryville
in Spencer County. The lateness
of the autumn made it necessary to put
up a shelter as quickly as possible, and
he built what was known on the frontier
as a half-faced camp, about fourteen feet
square. This differed from a cabin in
that it was closed on only three sides,
being quite open to the weather on the
fourth. A fire was usually made in
front of the open side, and thus the
necessity for having a chimney was done
away with. Thomas Lincoln doubtless
intended this only for a temporary
shelter, and as such it would have done
well enough in pleasant summer weather;
but it was a rude provision against the
storms and winds of an Indiana winter.
It shows his want of energy that the
family remained housed in this poor
camp for nearly a whole year; but, after
all, he must not be too hastily blamed.
He was far from idle. A cabin was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
doubtless begun, and there was the very
heavy work of clearing away the timber&mdash;cutting
down large trees, chopping
them into suitable lengths, and rolling
them together into great heaps to be
burned, or of splitting them into rails to
fence the small field upon which he managed
to raise a patch of corn and other
things during the following summer.</p>

<p>Though only seven years old, Abraham
was unusually large and strong for his
age, and he helped his father in all this
heavy labor of clearing the farm. In
after years, Mr. Lincoln said that an ax
"was put into his hands at once, and
from that till within his twenty-third
year he was almost constantly handling
that most useful instrument&mdash;less, of
course, in ploughing and harvesting
seasons." At first the Lincolns and
their seven or eight neighbors lived in
the unbroken forest. They had only
the tools and household goods they
brought with them, or such things as
they could fashion with their own
hands. There was no sawmill to saw
lumber. The village of Gentryville was
not even begun. Breadstuff could be
had only by sending young Abraham
seven miles on horseback with a bag of
corn to be ground in a hand grist-mill.</p>

<p>About the time the new cabin was
ready relatives and friends followed
from Kentucky, and some of these in
turn occupied the half-faced camp. During
the autumn a severe and mysterious
sickness broke out in their little settlement,
and a number of people died,
among them the mother of young Abraham.
There was no help to be had
beyond what the neighbors could give
each other. The nearest doctor lived
fully thirty miles away. There was not
even a minister to conduct the funerals.
Thomas Lincoln made the coffins for the
dead out of green lumber cut from the
forest trees with a whip-saw, and they
were laid to rest in a clearing in the woods.
Months afterward, largely through the
efforts of the sorrowing boy, a preacher
who chanced to come that way was
induced to hold a service and preach a
sermon over the grave of Mrs. Lincoln.</p>

<p>Her death was indeed a serious blow
to her husband and children. Abraham's
sister, Sarah, was only eleven years old,
and the tasks and cares of the little
household were altogether too heavy for
her years and experience. Nevertheless
they struggled bravely through the
winter and following summer; then in
the autumn of 1819 Thomas Lincoln
went back to Kentucky and married
Sarah Bush Johnston, whom he had
known, and it is said courted, when she
was only Sally Bush. She had married
about the time Lincoln married Nancy
Hanks, and her husband had died, leaving
her with three children. She came
of a better station in life than Thomas,
and was a woman with an excellent mind
as well as a warm and generous heart.
The household goods that she brought
with her to the Lincoln home filled a
four-horse wagon, and not only were
her own children well clothed and cared
for, but she was able at once to provide
little Abraham and Sarah with comforts
to which they had been strangers during
the whole of their young lives. Under
her wise management all jealousy was
avoided between the two sets of children;
urged on by her stirring example, Thomas
Lincoln supplied the yet unfinished cabin
with floor, door, and windows, and life
became more comfortable for all its
inmates, contentment if not happiness
reigning in the little home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span></p>

<p>The new stepmother quickly became
very fond of Abraham, and encouraged
him in every way in her power to study
and improve himself. The chances for
this were few enough. Mr. Lincoln has
left us a vivid picture of the situation.
"It was," he once wrote, "a wild region,
with many bears and other wild animals
still in the woods. There I grew up.
There were some schools, so-called, but
no qualification was ever required of a
teacher beyond readin', writin', and
cipherin' to the Rule of Three. If a
straggler supposed to understand Latin
happened to sojourn in the neighborhood,
he was looked upon as a wizard."</p>

<p>The school-house was a low cabin of
round logs, with split logs or "puncheons"
for a floor, split logs roughly leveled with
an ax and set up on legs for benches,
and holes cut out in the logs and the space
filled in with squares of greased paper
for window-panes. The main light came
in through the open door. Very often
Webster's "Elementary Spelling-book"
was the only text-book. This was the
kind of school most common in the
Middle West during Mr. Lincoln's boyhood,
though already in some places
there were schools of a more pretentious
character. Indeed, back in Kentucky,
at the very time that Abraham, a child
of six, was learning his letters from
Zachariah Riney, a boy only a year
older was attending a Catholic seminary
in the very next county. It is doubtful
if they ever met, but the destinies of the
two were strangely interwoven, for the
older boy was Jefferson Davis, who
became head of the Confederate government
shortly after Lincoln was elected
President of the United States.</p>

<p>As Abraham was only seven years
old when he left Kentucky, the little
beginnings he learned in the schools
kept by Riney and Hazel in that state
must have been very slight, probably
only his alphabet, or at most only three
or four pages of Webster's "Elementary
Spelling-book." The multiplication-table
was still a mystery to him, and
he could read or write only the words
he spelled. His first two years in
Indiana seem to have passed without
schooling of any sort, and the school
he attended shortly after coming under
the care of his stepmother was of the
simplest kind, for the Pigeon Creek
settlement numbered only eight or ten
poor families, and they lived deep in
the forest, where, even if they had had
the money for such luxuries, it would
have been impossible to buy books,
slates, pens, ink, or paper. It is worthy
of note, however, that in our western
country, even under such difficulties, a
school-house was one of the first buildings
to rise in every frontier settlement.
Abraham's second school in Indiana was
held when he was fourteen years old,
and the third in his seventeenth year.
By that time he had more books and
better teachers, but he had to walk four
or five miles to reach them. We know
that he learned to write, and was provided
with pen, ink, and a copy-book, and
a very small supply of writing paper, for
copies have been printed of several
scraps on which he carefully wrote down
tables of long measure, land measure,
and dry measure, as well as examples in
multiplication and compound division,
from his arithmetic. He was never able
to go to school again after this time, and
though the instruction he received from
his five teachers&mdash;two in Kentucky and
three in Indiana&mdash;extended over a period
of nine years, it must be remembered that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
it made up in all less than one twelvemonth;
"that the aggregate of all his
schooling did not amount to one year."</p>

<p>The fact that he received this instruction,
as he himself said, "by littles,"
was doubtless an advantage. A lazy
or indifferent boy would of course have
forgotten what was taught him at one
time before he had opportunity at
another; but Abraham was neither
indifferent nor lazy, and these widely
separated fragments of instruction were
precious steps to self-help. He pursued
his studies with very unusual purpose
and determination not only to understand
them at the moment, but to fix
them firmly in his mind. His early
companions all agree that he employed
every spare moment in keeping on with
some one of his studies. His stepmother
tells us that "When he came across a
passage that struck him, he would write
it down on boards if he had no paper,
and keep it there until he did get paper.
Then he would rewrite it, look at it,
repeat it. He had a copy-book, a kind
of scrap-book, in which he put down
all things, and thus preserved them."
He spent long evenings doing sums on
the fire-shovel. Iron fire-shovels were
a rarity among pioneers. Instead they
used a broad, thin clapboard with one
end narrowed to a handle, arranging
with this the piles of coals upon the
hearth, over which they set their "skillet"
and "oven" to do their cooking. It
was on such a wooden shovel that
Abraham worked his sums by the
flickering firelight, making his figures
with a piece of charcoal, and, when the
shovel was all covered, taking a drawing-knife
and shaving it off clean again.</p>

<p>The hours that he was able to devote
to his penmanship, his reading, and his
arithmetic were by no means many; for,
save for the short time that he was actually
in school, he was, during all these
years, laboring hard on his father's
farm, or hiring his youthful strength
to neighbors who had need of help in
the work of field or forest. In pursuit
of his knowledge he was on an up-hill
path; yet in spite of all obstacles he
worked his way to so much of an education
as placed him far ahead of his schoolmates
and quickly abreast of his various
teachers. He borrowed every book in
the neighborhood. The list is a short
one: "Robinson Crusoe," "Aesop's
Fables," Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress,"
Weems's "Life of Washington," and a
"History of the United States." When
everything else had been read, he resolutely
began on the "Revised Statutes
of Indiana," which Dave Turnham, the
constable, had in daily use, but permitted
him to come to his house and read.</p>

<p>Though so fond of his books, it must
not be supposed that he cared only for
work and serious study. He was a
social, sunny-tempered lad, as fond of
jokes and fun as he was kindly and
industrious. His stepmother said of
him: "I can say, what scarcely one
mother in a thousand can say, Abe
never gave me a cross word or look, and
never refused .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to do anything I
asked him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I must say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or
expect to see."</p>

<p>He and John Johnston, his stepmother's
son, and John Hanks, a relative
of his own mother's, worked barefoot
together in the fields, grubbing, plowing,
hoeing, gathering and shucking corn, and
taking part, when occasion offered, in
the practical jokes and athletic exercises
that enlivened the hard work of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
pioneers. For both work and play
Abraham had one great advantage. He
was not only a tall, strong country boy;
he soon grew to be a tall, strong, sinewy
man. He early reached the unusual
height of six feet four inches, and his
long arms gave him a degree of power
as an axman that few were able to rival.
He therefore usually led his fellows in
efforts of muscle as well as of mind.
That he could outrun, outlift, outwrestle
his boyish companions, that he
could chop faster, split more rails in a
day, carry a heavier log at a "raising,"
or excel the neighborhood champion in
any feat of frontier athletics, was doubtless
a matter of pride with him; but
stronger than all else was his eager
craving for knowledge. He felt instinctively
that the power of using the mind
rather than the muscles was the key to
success. He wished not only to wrestle
with the best of them, but to be able to
talk like the preacher, spell and cipher
like the school-master, argue like the
lawyer, and write like the editor. Yet
he was as far as possible from being
a prig. He was helpful, sympathetic,
cheerful. In all the neighborhood gatherings,
when settlers of various ages came
together at corn-huskings or house-raisings,
or when mere chance brought
half a dozen of them at the same time
to the post-office or the country store,
he was able, according to his years, to
add his full share to the gaiety of the
company. By reason of his reading
and his excellent memory, he soon became
the best story-teller among his companions;
and even the slight training gained
from his studies greatly broadened and
strengthened the strong reasoning faculty
with which he had been gifted by nature.
His wit might be mischievous, but it
was never malicious, and his nonsense
was never intended to wound or to hurt
the feelings. It is told of him that he
added to his fund of jokes and stories
humorous imitations of the sermons of
eccentric preachers.</p>

<p>Very likely too much is made of all
these boyish pranks. He grew up very
like his fellows. In only one particular
did he differ greatly from the frontier
boys around him. He never took any
pleasure in hunting. Almost every youth
of the backwoods early became an
excellent shot and a confirmed sportsman.
The woods still swarmed with
game, and every cabin depended largely
upon this for its supply of food. But
to his strength was added a gentleness
which made him shrink from killing or
inflicting pain, and the time the other
boys gave to lying in ambush, he preferred
to spend in reading or in efforts at
improving his mind.</p>

<p>Only twice during his life in Indiana
was the routine of his employment
changed. When he was about sixteen
years old he worked for a time for a
man who lived at the mouth of Anderson's
Creek, and here part of his duty
was to manage a ferry-boat which
carried passengers across the Ohio River.
It was very likely this experience which,
three years later, brought him another.
Mr. Gentry, the chief man of the village
of Gentryville that had grown up a mile
or so from his father's cabin, loaded a
flatboat on the Ohio River with the
produce his store had collected&mdash;corn,
flour, pork, bacon, and other miscellaneous
provisions&mdash;and putting it in
charge of his son Allen Gentry and of
Abraham Lincoln, sent them with it
down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, to
sell its cargo at the plantations of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
lower <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Misisssippi'">Mississippi</ins>, where sugar and cotton
were the principal crops, and where
other food supplies were needed to feed
the slaves. No better proof is needed
of the reputation for strength, skill,
honesty, and intelligence that this tall
country boy had already won for himself,
than that he was chosen to navigate
the flatboat a thousand miles to the
"sugar-coast" of the Mississippi River,
sell its load, and bring back the money.
Allen Gentry was supposed to be in
command, but from the record of his
after life we may be sure that Abraham
did his full share both of work and management.
The elder Gentry paid Lincoln
eight dollars a month and his passage
home on a steamboat for this service.
The voyage was made successfully,
although not without adventure; for
one night, after the boat was tied up
to the shore, the boys were attacked by
seven negroes, who came aboard intending
to kill and rob him. There was a
lively scrimmage, in which, though
slightly hurt, they managed to beat off
their assailants, and then, hastily cutting
their boat adrift, swung out on the
stream. The marauding band little
dreamed that they were attacking the
man who in after years was to give their
race its freedom; and though the future
was equally hidden from Abraham, it
is hard to estimate the vistas of hope
and ambition that this long journey
opened to him. It was his first look
into the wide, wide world.</p>

<h4><br />IN THE WESTERN WILDERNESS</h4>

<div class='center'>ANNA HOWARD SHAW</div>

<p>My father was one of a number of
Englishmen who took up tracts in the
northern forests of Michigan, with the
old dream of establishing a colony there.
None of these men had the least practical
knowledge of farming. They were city
men or followers of trades which had no
connection with farm life. They went
straight into the thick timber-land,
instead of going to the rich and waiting
prairies, and they crowned this initial
mistake by cutting down the splendid
timber instead of letting it stand. Thus
bird's-eye maple and other beautiful
woods were used as fire-wood and in
the construction of rude cabins, and the
greatest asset of the pioneer was ignored.</p>

<p>Father preceded us to the Michigan
woods, and there, with his oldest son,
James, took up a claim. They cleared
a space in the wilderness just large
enough for a log cabin, and put up the
bare walls of the cabin itself. Then
father returned to Lawrence and his
work, leaving James behind. A few
months later (this was in 1859), my
mother, my two sisters, Eleanor and
Mary, my youngest brother, Henry,
eight years of age, and I, then twelve,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
went to Michigan to work on and hold
down the claim while father, for eighteen
months longer, stayed on in Lawrence,
sending us such remittances as he could.
His second and third sons, John and
Thomas, remained in the East with
him.</p>

<p>Every detail of our journey through
the wilderness is clear in my mind.
At that time the railroad terminated
at Grand Rapids, Michigan, and we
covered the remaining distance&mdash;about
one hundred miles&mdash;by wagon, riding
through a dense and often trackless
forest. My brother James met us at
Grand Rapids with what, in those days,
was called a lumber-wagon, but which
had a horrible resemblance to a vehicle
from the health department. My sisters
and I gave it one cold look and
turned from it; we were so pained by
its appearance that we refused to ride
in it through the town. Instead, we
started off on foot, trying to look as if
we had no association with it, and we
climbed into the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unwildy'">unwieldy</ins> vehicle only
when the city streets were far behind
us. Every available inch of space in
the wagon was filled with bedding and
provisions. As yet we had no furniture;
we were to make that for ourselves when
we reached our cabin; and there was so
little room for us to ride that we children
walked by turns, while James, from the
beginning of the journey to its end, seven
days later, led our weary horses.</p>

<p>To my mother, who was never strong,
the whole experience must have been a
nightmare of suffering and stoical endurance.
For us children there were compensations.
The expedition took on
the character of a high adventure, in
which we sometimes had shelter and
sometimes failed to find it, sometimes
were fed, but often went hungry. We
forded innumerable streams, the wheels
of the heavy wagon sinking so deeply
into the stream-beds that we often had
to empty our load before we could get
them out again. Fallen trees lay across
our paths, rivers caused long detours,
while again and again we lost our way
or were turned aside by impenetrable
forest tangles.</p>

<p>Our first day's journey covered less
than eight miles, and that night we
stopped at a farm-house which was the
last bit of civilization we saw. Early
the next morning we were off again,
making the slow progress due to the rough
roads and our heavy load. At night we
stopped at a place called Thomas's Inn,
only to be told by the woman who kept
it that there was nothing in the house
to eat. Her husband, she said, had gone
"outside" (to Grand Rapids) to get some
flour, and had not returned&mdash;but she
added that we could spend the night,
if we chose, and enjoy shelter, if not
food. We had provisions in our wagon,
so we wearily entered, after my brother
had got out some of our pork and opened
a barrel of flour. With this help the
woman made some biscuits, which were
so green that my poor mother could not
eat them. She had admitted to us that
the one thing she had in the house was
saleratus, and she had used this ingredient
with an unsparing hand. When the
meal was eaten she broke the further
news that there were no beds.</p>

<p>"The old woman can sleep with me,"
she suggested, "and the girls can sleep
on the floor. The boys will have to go
to the barn."</p>

<p>She and her bed were not especially
attractive, and mother decided to lie on
the floor with us. We had taken our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
bedding from the wagon, and we slept
very well; but though she was usually
superior to small annoyances, I think my
mother resented being called an "old
woman." She must have felt like one
that night, but she was only about
forty-eight years of age.</p>

<p>At dawn the next morning we resumed
our journey, and every day after that
we were able to cover the distance
demanded by the schedule arranged
before we started. This meant that
some sort of shelter usually awaited us
at night. But one day we knew there
would be no houses between the place
we left in the morning and that where
we were to sleep. The distance was
about twenty miles, and when twilight
fell we had not made it. In the back
of the wagon my mother had a box of
little pigs, and during the afternoon
these had broken loose and escaped
into the woods. We had lost much
time in finding them, and we were so
exhausted that when we came to a hut
made of twigs and boughs we decided
to camp in it for the night, though we
knew nothing about it. My brother had
unharnessed the horses, and my mother
and sister were cooking dough-god&mdash;a
mixture of flour, water, and soda, fried
in a pan&mdash;when two men rode up on
horseback and called my brother to one
side. Immediately after the talk which
followed James harnessed his horses
again and forced us to go on, though by
that time darkness had fallen. He told
mother, but did not tell us children until
long afterward, that a man had been
murdered in the hut only the night
before. The murderer was still at large
in the woods, and the new-comers were
members of a posse who were searching
for him. My brother needed no urging
to put as many miles as he could between
us and the sinister spot.</p>

<p>In that fashion we made our way to
our new home. The last day, like the
first, we traveled only eight miles, but
we spent the night in a house I shall
never forget. It was beautifully clean,
and for our evening meal its mistress
brought out loaves of bread which were
the largest we had ever seen. She cut
great slices of this bread for us and
spread maple sugar on them, and it
seemed to us that never before had
anything tasted so good.</p>

<p>The next morning we made the last
stage of our journey, our hearts filled
with the joy of nearing our new home.
We all had an idea that we were going
to a farm, and we expected some resemblance
at least to the prosperous farms
we had seen in New England. My
mother's mental picture was, naturally,
of an English farm. Possibly she had
visions of red barns and deep meadows,
sunny skies and daisies. What we found
awaiting us were the four walls and the
roof of a good-sized log-house, standing
in a small cleared strip of the wilderness,
its doors and windows represented by
square holes, its floor also a thing of the
future, its whole effect achingly forlorn
and desolate. It was late in the afternoon
when we drove up to the opening
that was its front entrance, and I shall
never forget the look my mother turned
upon the place. Without a word she
crossed its threshold, and, standing very
still, looked slowly around her. Then
something within her seemed to give
way, and she sank upon the ground.
She could not realize even then, I think,
that this was really the place father had
prepared for us, that here he expected
us to live. When she finally took it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
she buried her face in her hands, and in
that way she sat for hours without moving
or speaking. For the first time in
her life she had forgotten us; and we, for
our part, dared not speak to her. We
stood around her in a frightened group,
talking to one another in whispers. Our
little world had crumbled under our feet.
Never before had we seen our mother
give way to despair.</p>

<p>Night began to fall. The woods
became alive with night creatures, and
the most harmless made the most noise.
The owls began to hoot, and soon we
heard the wildcat, whose cry&mdash;a screech
like that of a lost and panic-stricken
child&mdash;is one of the most appalling
sounds of the forest. Later the wolves
added their howls to the uproar, but
though darkness came and we children
whimpered around her, our mother still
sat in her strange lethargy.</p>

<p>At last my brother brought the horses
close to the cabin and built fires to protect
them and us. He was only twenty,
but he showed himself a man during
those early pioneer days. While he was
picketing the horses and building his
protecting fires my mother came to herself,
but her face when she raised it was
worse than her silence had been. She
seemed to have died and to have returned
to us from the grave, and I am sure she
felt that she had done so. From that
moment she took up again the burden
of her life, a burden she did not lay down
until she passed away; but her face never
lost the deep lines those first hours of
her pioneer life had cut upon it.</p>

<p>That night we slept on boughs spread
on the earth inside the cabin walls, and
we put blankets before the holes which
represented our doors and windows, and
kept our watch-fires burning. Soon the
other children fell asleep, but there was
no sleep for me. I was only twelve
years old, but my mind was full of
fancies. Behind our blankets, swaying
in the night wind, I thought I saw the
heads and pushing shoulders of animals
and heard their padded footfalls.</p>

<p>We faced our situation with clear and
unalarmed eyes the morning after our
arrival. The problem of food, we knew,
was at least temporarily solved. We
had brought with us enough coffee, pork,
and flour to last for several weeks; and
the one necessity father had put inside
the cabin walls was a great fireplace,
made of mud and stones, in which our
food could be cooked. The problem of
our water-supply was less simple, but
my brother James solved it for the time
by showing us a creek a long distance
from the house, and for months we
carried from this creek, in pails, every
drop of water we used, save that which
we caught in troughs when the rain fell.</p>

<p>We held a family council after breakfast,
and in this, though I was only
twelve, I took an eager and determined
part. I loved work&mdash;it has always
been my favorite form of recreation&mdash;and
my spirit rose to the opportunities
of it which smiled on us from every side.
Obviously the first thing to do was to
put doors and windows into the yawning
holes father had left for them, and to lay
a board flooring over the earth inside
our cabin walls, and these duties we
accomplished before we had occupied
our new home a fortnight. There was
a small saw-mill nine miles from our
cabin, on the spot that is now Big
Rapids, and there we bought our lumber.
The labor we supplied ourselves, and
though we put our hearts into it and the
results at the time seemed beautiful to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
our partial eyes, I am forced to admit,
in looking back upon them, that they
halted this side of perfection. We began
by making three windows and two doors;
then, inspired by these achievements,
we ambitiously constructed an attic and
divided the ground floor with partitions,
which gave us four rooms.</p>

<p>The general effect was temperamental
and sketchy. The boards which formed
the floor were never even nailed down;
they were fine, wide planks without a
knot in them, and they looked so well
that we merely fitted them together as
closely as we could and light-heartedly
let them go at that. Neither did we
properly chink the house. Nothing is
more comfortable than a log cabin which
has been carefully built and finished; but
for some reason&mdash;probably because there
seemed always a more urgent duty calling
to us around the corner&mdash;we never
plastered our house at all. The result
was that on many future winter mornings
we awoke to find ourselves chastely
blanketed by snow, while the only warm
spot in our living-room was that directly
in front of the fireplace, where great logs
burned all day. Even there our faces
scorched while our spines slowly congealed,
until we learned to revolve before
the fire like a bird upon a spit. No
doubt we would have worked more
thoroughly if my brother James, who
was twenty years old and our tower
of strength, had remained with us; but
when we had been in our new home only
a few months he fell ill and was forced to
go East for an operation. He was never
able to return to us, and thus my mother,
we three young girls, and my youngest
brother&mdash;Harry, who was only eight years
old&mdash;made our fight alone until father
came to us, more than a year later.</p>

<p>Mother was practically an invalid.
She had a nervous affection which made
it impossible for her to stand without
the support of a chair. But she sewed
with unusual skill, and it was due to her
that our clothes, notwithstanding the
strain to which we subjected them, were
always in good condition. She sewed
for hours every day, and she was able
to move about the house, after a fashion,
by pushing herself around on a stool
which James made for her as soon as
we arrived. He also built for her a
more comfortable chair with a high
back.</p>

<p>The division of labor planned at the
first council was that mother should do
our sewing, and my older sisters, Eleanor
and Mary, the housework, which was
far from taxing, for of course we lived
in the simplest manner. My brothers
and I were to do the work out of doors,
an arrangement that suited me very well,
though at first, owing to our lack of
experience, our activities were somewhat
curtailed. It was too late in the season
for plowing or planting, even if we had
possessed anything with which to plow,
and, moreover, our so-called "cleared"
land was thick with sturdy tree-stumps.
Even during the second summer plowing
was impossible; we could only plant
potatoes and corn, and follow the most
primitive method in doing even this.
We took an ax, chopped up the sod, put
the seed under it, and let the seed grow.
The seed did grow, too&mdash;in the most
gratifying and encouraging manner. Our
green corn and potatoes were the best I
have ever eaten. But for the present
we lacked these luxuries.</p>

<p>We had, however, in their place, large
quantities of wild fruit&mdash;gooseberries,
raspberries, and plums&mdash;which Harry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
and I gathered on the banks of our
creek. Harry also became an expert
fisherman. We had no hooks or lines,
but he took wires from our hoop-skirts
and made snares at the ends of poles.
My part of this work was to stand on a
log and frighten the fish out of their
holes by making horrible sounds, which
I did with impassioned earnestness.
When the fish hurried to the surface
of the water to investigate the appalling
noises they had heard, they were easily
snared by our small boy, who was very
proud of his ability to contribute in this
way to the family table.</p>

<p>During our first winter we lived largely
on cornmeal, making a little journey of
twenty miles to the nearest mill to buy
it; but even at that we were better off
than our neighbors, for I remember one
family in our region who for an entire
winter lived solely on coarse-grained
yellow turnips, gratefully changing their
diet to leeks when these came in the
spring.</p>

<p>Such furniture as we had we made
ourselves. In addition to my mother's
two chairs and the bunks which took
the place of beds, James made a settle
for the living-room, as well as a table
and several stools. At first we had our
tree-cutting done for us, but we soon
became expert in this gentle art, and I
developed such skill that in later years,
after father came, I used to stand with
him and "heart" a log.</p>

<p>On every side, and at every hour of
the day, we came up against the relentless
limitations of pioneer life. There
was not a team of horses in our entire
region. The team with which my brother
had driven us through the wilderness had
been hired at Grand Rapids for that
occasion, and, of course, immediately
returned. Our lumber was delivered by
ox-teams, and the absolutely essential
purchases we made "outside" (at the
nearest shops, forty miles away) were
carried through the forest on the backs
of men. Our mail was delivered once a
month by a carrier who made the journey
in alternate stages of horseback
riding and canoeing. But we had health,
youth, enthusiasm, good appetites, and
the wherewithal to satisfy them, and at
night in our primitive bunks we sank
into abysses of dreamless slumber such
as I have never known since. Indeed,
looking back upon them, those first
months seem to have been a long-drawn-out
and glorious picnic, interrupted only
by occasional hours of pain or panic,
when we were hurt or frightened.</p>

<p>Naturally, our two greatest menaces
were wild animals and Indians, but as
the days passed the first of these lost
the early terrors with which we had
associated them. We grew indifferent
to the sounds that had made our first
night a horror to us all&mdash;there was even
a certain homeliness in them&mdash;while we
regarded with accustomed, almost blase
eyes the various furred creatures of which
we caught distant glimpses as they slunk
through the forest. Their experience
with other settlers had taught them
caution; it soon became clear that they
were as eager to avoid us as we were
to shun them, and by common consent
we gave each other ample elbow-room.
But the Indians were all around us, and
every settler had a collection of hair-raising
tales to tell of them. It was
generally agreed that they were dangerous
only when they were drunk; but as
they were drunk whenever they could get
whisky, and as whisky was constantly
given them in exchange for pelts and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
game, there was a harrowing doubt in
our minds whenever they approached us.</p>

<p>In my first encounter with them I
was alone in the woods at sunset with
my small brother Harry. We were hunting
a cow James had bought, and our
young eyes were peering eagerly among
the trees, on the alert for any moving
object. Suddenly, at a little distance,
coming directly toward us, we saw a
party of Indians. There were five of
them, all men, walking in single file, as
noiselessly as ghosts, their moccasined
feet causing not even a rustle among the
dry leaves that carpeted the woods.
All the horrible stories we had heard of
Indian cruelty flashed into our minds,
and for a moment we were dumb with
terror. Then I remembered having been
told that the one thing one must not do
before them is to show fear. Harry was
carrying a rope with which we had
expected to lead home our reluctant
cow, and I seized one end of it and whispered
to him that we would "play
horse," pretending he was driving me.
We pranced toward the Indians on feet
that felt like lead, and with eyes so glazed
by terror that we could see nothing save
a line of moving figures; but as we
passed them they did not give to our
little impersonation of care-free children
even the tribute of a side-glance. They
were, we realized, headed straight for
our home; and after a few moments we
doubled on our tracks and, keeping at
a safe distance from them among the
trees, ran back to warn our mother that
they were coming.</p>

<p>As it happened, James was away, and
mother had to meet her unwelcome guests
supported only by her young children.
She at once prepared a meal, however,
and when they arrived she welcomed
them calmly and gave them the best
she had. After they had eaten they
began to point at and demand objects
they fancied in the room&mdash;my brother's
pipe, some tobacco, a bowl, and such
trifles&mdash;and my mother, who was afraid
to annoy them by refusal, gave them
what they asked. They were quite
sober, and though they left without
expressing any appreciation of her hospitality,
they made her a second visit a
few months later, bringing a large quantity
of venison and a bag of cranberries as
a graceful return. These Indians were
Ottawas; and later we became very
friendly with them and their tribe, even
to the degree of attending one of their
dances, which I shall describe later.</p>

<p>Our second encounter with Indians
was a less agreeable experience. There
were seven "Marquette warriors" in
the next group of callers, and they
were all intoxicated. Moreover, they
had brought with them several jugs
of bad whisky&mdash;the raw and craze-provoking
product supplied them by
the fur-dealers&mdash;and it was clear that
our cabin was to be the scene of an
orgy. Fortunately, my brother James
was at home on this occasion, and as
the evening grew old and the Indians,
grouped together around the fire, became
more and more irresponsible, he devised
a plan for our safety. Our attic was
finished, and its sole entrance was by a
ladder through a trap-door. At James's
whispered command my sister Eleanor
slipped up into the attic, and from the
back window let down a rope, to which
he tied all the weapons we had&mdash;his gun
and several axes. These Eleanor drew
up and concealed in one of the bunks.
My brother then directed that as quietly
as possible, and at long intervals, one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
member of the family after another
was to slip up the ladder and into
the attic, going quite casually, that
the Indians might not realize what we
were doing. Once there, with the ladder
drawn up after us and the trap-door
closed, we would be reasonably safe,
unless our guests decided to burn the
cabin.</p>

<p>The evening seemed endless, and was
certainly nerve-racking. The Indians
ate everything in the house, and from
my seat in a dim corner I watched them
while my sisters waited on them. I
can still see the tableau they made in
the firelit room and hear the unfamiliar
accents of their speech as they talked
together. Occasionally one of them
would pull a hair from his head, seize
his scalping-knife, and cut the hair
with it&mdash;a most unpleasant sight! When
either of my sisters approached them
some of the Indians would make gestures,
as if capturing and scalping her. Through
it all, however, the whisky held their
close attention, and it was due to this
that we succeeded in reaching the attic
unobserved, James coming last of all
and drawing the ladder after him.
Mother and the children were then put
to bed; but through that interminable
night James and Eleanor lay flat upon
the floor, watching through the cracks
between the boards the revels of the
drunken Indians, which grew wilder with
every hour that crawled toward sunrise.
There was no knowing when they would
miss us or how soon their mood might
change. At any moment they might
make an attack upon us or set fire to the
cabin. By dawn, however, their whisky
was all gone, and they were in so deep a
stupor that, one after the other, the
seven fell from their chairs to the floor,
where they sprawled unconscious. When
they awoke they left quietly and without
trouble of any kind. They seemed a
strangely subdued and chastened band;
probably they were wretchedly ill after
their debauch on the adulterated whisky
the traders had given them.</p>

<p>That autumn the Ottawa tribe had a
great corn celebration, to which we and
the other settlers were invited. James
and my older sisters attended it, and I
went with them, by my own urgent
invitation. It seemed to me that as I
was sharing the work and the perils of
our new environment, I might as well
share its joys; and I finally succeeded in
making my family see the logic of this
position. The central feature of the
festivity was a huge kettle, many feet
in circumference, into which the Indians
dropped the most extraordinary variety
of food we had ever seen combined.
Deer heads went into it whole, as well
as every kind of meat and vegetable
the members of the tribe could procure.
We all ate some of this agreeable mixture,
and later, with one another, and
even with the Indians, we danced gaily
to the music of a tom-tom and a drum.
The affair was extremely interesting until
the whisky entered and did its unpleasant
work. When our hosts began to fall
over in the dance and slumber where
they lay, and when the squaws began to
show the same ill effects of their refreshments,
we unostentatiously slipped away.</p>

<p>During the winter, life offered us
few diversions and many hardships.
Our creek froze over, and the water
problem became a serious one, which
we met with increasing difficulty as the
temperature steadily fell. We melted
snow and ice, and existed through the
frozen months, but with an amount of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>
discomfort which made us unwilling to
repeat at least that special phase of
our experience. In the spring, therefore,
I made a well. Long before this,
James had gone, and Harry and I were
now the only out-door members of our
working-force. Harry was still too small
to help with the well; but a young man,
who had formed the neighborly habit of
riding eighteen miles to call on us, gave
me much friendly aid. We located the
well with a switch, and when we had
dug as far as we could reach with our
spades, my assistant descended into the
hole and threw the earth up to the edge,
from which I in turn removed it. As
the well grew deeper we made a halfway
shelf, on which I stood, he throwing
the earth on the shelf, and I shoveling
it up from that point. Later, as he
descended still farther into the hole we
were making, he shoveled the earth into
buckets and passed them up to me, I
passing them on to my sister, who was
now pressed into service. When the
excavation was deep enough we made the
wall of slabs of wood, roughly joined
together. I recall that well with calm
content. It was not a thing of beauty,
but it was a thoroughly practical well,
and it remained the only one we had
during the twelve years the family
occupied the cabin.</p>

<p>The second spring after our arrival
Harry and I extended our operations by
tapping the sugar-bushes, collecting all
the sap, and carrying it home in pails
slung from our yoke-laden shoulders.
Together we made one hundred and
fifty pounds of sugar and a barrel of
syrup, but here again, as always, we
worked in primitive ways. To get the
sap we chopped a gash in the tree and
drove in a spile. Then we dug out a
trough to catch the sap. It was no
light task to lift these troughs full of
sap and empty the sap into buckets,
but we did it successfully, and afterward
built fires and boiled it down. By this
time we had also cleared some of our
ground, and during the spring we were
able to plow, dividing the work in a way
that seemed fair to us both. These were
strenuous occupations for a boy of nine
and a girl of thirteen, but, though we
were not inordinately good children, we
never complained; we found them very
satisfactory substitutes for more normal
bucolic joys. Inevitably, we had our
little tragedies. Our cow died, and for
an entire winter we went without milk.
Our coffee soon gave out, and as a substitute
we made and used a mixture of
browned peas and burnt rye. In the
winter we were always cold, and the
water problem, until we had built our
well, was ever with us.</p>

<p>When I was fifteen years old I was
offered a situation as school-teacher.
By this time the community was growing
around us with the rapidity characteristic
of these Western settlements, and
we had nearer neighbors whose children
needed instruction. I passed an examination
before a school-board consisting
of three nervous and self-conscious men
whose certificate I still hold, and I at
once began my professional career on
the modest salary of two dollars a week
and my board. The school was four
miles from my home, so I "boarded
round" with the families of my pupils,
staying two weeks in each place, and
often walking from three to six miles a
day to and from my little log school-house
in every kind of weather. During
the first year I had about fourteen pupils,
of varying ages, sizes, and temperaments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
and there was hardly a book in the schoolroom
except those I owned. One little
girl, I remembered, read from an almanac,
while a second used a hymn-book.</p>

<p>In winter the school-house was heated
by a wood-stove to which the teacher
had to give close personal attention. I
could not depend on my pupils to make
the fires or carry in the fuel; and it was
often necessary to fetch the wood myself,
sometimes for long distances through
the forest. Again and again, after miles
of walking through winter storms, I
reached the school-house with my clothing
wet through, and in these soaked
garments I taught during the day. In
"boarding round" I often found myself
in one-room cabins, with bunks at the
end and the sole partition a sheet or a
blanket, behind which I slept with one or
two of the children. It was the custom
on these occasions for the man of the
house to delicately retire to the barn
while we women got to bed, and to
disappear again in the morning while
we dressed. In some places the meals
were so badly cooked that I could not
eat them, and often the only food my
poor little pupils brought to school for
their noonday meal was a piece of bread
or a bit of raw pork.</p>

<h4><br />THE PASS OF THERMOPYLAE</h4>

<div class='center'>CHARLOTTE M. YONGE<br /><br />

<i>B. C. 430</i></div>

<p>There was trembling in Greece. "The
Great King," as the Greeks called the
chief potentate of the East, whose domains
stretched from the Indian Caucasus
to the Aeg&aelig;us, from the Caspian
to the Red Sea, was marshaling his forces
against the little free states that nestled
amid the rocks and gulfs of the Eastern
Mediterranean. Already had his might
devoured the cherished colonies of the
Greeks on the eastern shore of the
Archipelago, and every traitor to home
institutions found a ready asylum at
that despotic court, and tried to revenge
his own wrongs by whispering incitements
to invasion. "All people, nations,
and languages," was the commencement
of the decrees of that monarch's
court; and it was scarcely a vain boast,
for his satraps ruled over subject kingdoms,
and among his tributary nations
he counted the Chaldean, with his learning
and old civilization, the wise and
steadfast Jew, the skillful Ph&#339;nician,
the learned Egyptian, the wild freebooting
Arab of the desert, the dark-skinned
Ethiopian, and over all these ruled the
keen witted, active native Persian race,
the conquerors of all the rest, and led
by a chosen band proudly called the
Immortal. His many capitals&mdash;Babylon
the great, Susa, Persepolis, and the
like&mdash;were names of dreamy splendor to
the Greeks, described now and then by
Ionians from Asia Minor who had carried
their tribute to the King's own feet, or
by courtier slaves who had escaped with
difficulty from being all too serviceable at
the tyrannic court. And the lord of this
enormous empire was about to launch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
his countless host against the little cluster
of states, the whole of which together
would hardly equal one province of the
huge Asiatic realm! Moreover, it was a
war not only on the men but on their
gods. The Persians were zealous adorers
of the sun and of fire, they abhorred the
idol-worship of the Greeks, and defiled
and plundered every temple that fell in
their way. Death and desolation were
almost the best that could be looked for
at such hands&mdash;slavery and torture from
cruelly barbarous masters would only
too surely be the lot of numbers, should
their land fall a prey to the conquerors.</p>

<p>True it was that ten years back the
former Great King had sent his best
troops to be signally defeated upon the
coast of Attica; but the losses at Marathon
had but stimulated the Persian lust
of conquest, and the new King Xerxes
was gathering together such myriads of
men as should crush down the Greeks and
overrun their country by mere force of
numbers.</p>

<p>The muster place was at Sardis, and
there Greek spies had seen the multitudes
assembling and the state and magnificence
of the king's attendants. Envoys
had come from him to demand earth
and water from each state in Greece, as
emblems that land and sea were his, but
each state was resolved to be free, and
only Thessaly, that which lay first in his
path, consented to yield the token of subjugation.
A council was held at the
Isthmus of Corinth, and attended by
deputies from all the states of Greece to
consider of the best means of defense.
The ships of the enemy would coast
round the shores of the Aegean sea, the
land army would cross the Hellespont on
a bridge of boats lashed together, and
march southwards into Greece. The
only hope of averting the danger lay in
defending such passages as, from the
nature of the ground, were so narrow
that only a few persons could fight hand
to hand at once, so that courage would
be of more avail than numbers.</p>

<p>The first of these passes was called
Tempe, and a body of troops was sent
to guard it; but they found that this was
useless and impossible, and came back
again. The next was at Thermopylae.
Look in your map of the Archipelago, or
Aegean Sea, as it was then called, for the
great island of Negropont, or by its old
name, Eub&#339;a. It looks like a piece
broken off from the coast, and to the
north is shaped like the head of a bird,
with the beak running into a gulf, that
would fit over it, upon the main land,
and between the island and the coast is
an exceedingly narrow strait. The Persian
army would have to march round
the edge of the gulf. They could not cut
straight across the country, because the
ridge of mountains called Oeta rose up
and barred their way. Indeed, the
woods, rocks, and precipices came down
so near the sea-shore that in two places
there was only room for one single wheel
track between the steeps and the impassable
morass that formed the border of
the gulf on its south side. These two
very narrow places were called the gates
of the pass, and were about a mile apart.
There was a little more width left in the
intervening space; but in this there were
a number of springs of warm mineral
water, salt and sulphurous, which were
used for the sick to bathe in, and thus
the place was called Thermopylae, or the
Hot Gates. A wall had once been built
across the westernmost of these narrow
places, when the Thessalians and Phocians,
who lived on either side of it, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
been at war with one another; but it
had been allowed to go to decay, since
the Phocians had found out that there
was a very steep narrow mountain path
along the bed of a torrent, by which it
was possible to cross from one territory
to the other without going round this
marshy coast road.</p>

<p>This was, therefore, an excellent place
to defend. The Greek ships were all
drawn up on the further side of Eub&#339;a
to prevent the Persian vessels from getting
into the strait and landing men
beyond the pass, and a division of the
army was sent off to guard the Hot
Gates. The council at the Isthmus did
not know of the mountain pathway, and
thought that all would be safe as long as the
Persians were kept out of the coast path.</p>

<p>The troops sent for this purpose were
from different cities, and amounted to
about 4,000 who were to keep the pass
against two millions. The leader of
them was Leonidas, who had newly
become one of the two kings of Sparta,
the city that above all in Greece trained
its sons to be hardy soldiers, dreading
death infinitely less than shame. Leonidas
had already made up his mind that
the expedition would probably be his
death, perhaps because a prophecy had
been given at the Temple at Delphi that
Sparta should be saved by the death of
one of her kings of the race of Hercules.
He was allowed by law to take with him
300 men, and these he chose most carefully,
not merely for their strength and
courage, but selecting those who had
sons, so that no family might altogether
be destroyed. These Spartans, with
their helots or slaves, made up his own
share of the numbers, but all the army
was under his generalship. It is even
said that the 300 celebrated their own
funeral rites before they set out lest they
should be deprived of them by the enemy,
since, as we have already seen, it was the
Greek belief that the spirits of the dead
found no rest till their obsequies had
been performed. Such preparations did
not daunt the spirits of Leonidas and his
men, and his wife, Gorgo, was not a
woman to be faint-hearted or hold him
back. Long before, when she was a very
little girl, a word of hers had saved her
father from listening to a traitorous message
from the King of Persia; and every
Spartan lady was bred up to be able to
say to those she best loved that they
must come home from battle "with the
shield or on it"&mdash;either carrying it victoriously
or borne upon it as a corpse.</p>

<p>When Leonidas came to Thermopylae,
the Phocians told him of the mountain
path through the chestnut woods of
Mount Oeta, and begged to have the
privilege of guarding it on a spot high
up on the mountain side, assuring him
that it was very hard to find at the other
end, and that there was every probability
that the enemy would never discover
it. He consented, and encamping
around the warm springs, caused the
broken wall to be repaired, and made
ready to meet the foe.</p>

<p>The Persian army were seen covering
the whole country like locusts, and the
hearts of some of the southern Greeks in
the pass began to sink. Their homes in
the Peloponnesus were comparatively
secure&mdash;had they not better fall back
and reserve themselves to defend the
Isthmus of Corinth? But Leonidas,
though Sparta was safe below the Isthmus,
had no intention of abandoning
his northern allies, and kept the other
Peloponnesians to their posts, only sending
messengers for further help.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently a Persian on horseback rode
up to reconnoiter the pass. He could
not see over the wall, but in front of it
and on the ramparts, he saw the Spartans,
some of them engaged in active
sports, and others in combing their long
hair. He rode back to the king, and
told him what he had seen. Now,
Xerxes had in his camp an exiled Spartan
Prince, named Demaratus, who had
become a traitor to his country, and was
serving as counselor to the enemy.
Xerxes sent for him, and asked whether
his countrymen were mad to be thus
employed instead of fleeing away; but
Demaratus made answer that a hard
fight was no doubt in preparation, and
that it was the custom of the Spartans
to array their hair with especial care
when they were about to enter upon any
great peril. Xerxes would, however, not
believe that so petty a force could intend
to resist him, and waited four days,
probably expecting his fleet to assist
him, but as it did not appear, the attack
was made.</p>

<p>The Greeks, stronger men and more
heavily armed, were far better able to
fight to advantage than the Persians
with their short spears and wicker shields,
and beat them off with great ease. It is
said that Xerxes three times leapt off his
throne in despair at the sight of his
troops being driven backwards; and thus
for two days it seemed as easy to force
a way through the Spartans as through
the rocks themselves. Nay, how could
slavish troops, dragged from home to
spread the victories of an ambitious king,
fight like freemen who felt that their
strokes were to defend their homes and
children?</p>

<p>But on that evening a wretched man,
named Ephialtes, crept into the Persian
camp, and offered, for a great sum of
money, to show the mountain path that
would enable the enemy to take the brave
defenders in the rear! A Persian general,
named Hydarnes, was sent off at
night-fall with a detachment to secure
this passage, and was guided through
the thick forests that clothed the hillside.
In the stillness of the air, at daybreak,
the Phocian guards of the path
were startled by the crackling of the
chestnut leaves under the tread of many
feet. They started up, but a shower of
arrows was discharged on them, and forgetting
all save the present alarm, they
fled to a higher part of the mountain,
and the enemy, without waiting to pursue
them, began to descend.</p>

<p>As day dawned, morning light showed
the watchers of the Grecian camp below
a glittering and shimmering in the torrent
bed where the shaggy forests opened; but
it was not the sparkle of water, but the
shine of gilded helmets and the gleaming
of silvered spears. Moreover, a Cimmerian
crept over to the wall from the
Persian camp with tidings that the path
had been betrayed, that the enemy were
climbing it, and would come down beyond
the Eastern Gate. Still, the way
was rugged and circuitous, the Persians
would hardly descend before midday,
and there was ample time for the Greeks
to escape before they could thus be shut
in by the enemy.</p>

<p>There was a short council held over the
morning sacrifice. Megistias, the seer,
on inspecting the entrails of the slain
victim, declared, as well he might, that
their appearance boded disaster. Him
Leonidas ordered to retire, but he refused,
though he sent home his only son. There
was no disgrace to an ordinary tone of
mind in leaving a post that could not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
held, and Leonidas recommended all the
allied troops under his command to
march away while yet the way was open.
As to himself and his Spartans, they had
made up their minds to die at their post,
and there could be no doubt that the
example of such a resolution would do
more to save Greece than their best
efforts could ever do if they were careful
to reserve themselves for another occasion.</p>

<p>All the allies consented to retreat,
except the eighty men who came from
Mycenae and the 700 Thespians, who
declared that they would not desert
Leonidas. There were also 400 Thebans
who remained; and thus the whole number
that stayed with Leonidas to confront
two million of enemies were 1400 warriors,
besides the helots or attendants on
the 300 Spartans, whose number is not
known, but there was probably at least
one to each. Leonidas had two kinsmen
in the camp, like himself, claiming the
blood of Hercules, and he tried to save
them by giving them letters and messages
to Sparta; but one answered that "he
had come to fight, not to carry letters";
and the other, that "his deeds would tell
all that Sparta wished to know." Another
Spartan, named Dienices, when told that
the enemy's archers were so numerous
that their arrows darkened the sun, replied,
"So much the better, we shall fight
in the shade." Two of the 300 had been
sent to a neighboring village, suffering
severely from a complaint in the eyes.
One of them, called Eurytus, put on his
armor, and commanded his helot to lead
him to his place in the ranks; the other,
called Aristodemus, was so overpowered
with illness that he allowed himself to
be carried away with the retreating allies.
It was still early in the day when all were
gone, and Leonidas gave the word to his
men to take their last meal. "To-night,"
he said, "we shall sup with
Pluto."</p>

<p>Hitherto, he had stood on the defensive,
and had husbanded the lives of his
men; but he now desired to make as
great a slaughter as possible, so as to
inspire the enemy with dread of the Grecian
name. He therefore marched out
beyond the wall, without waiting to be
attacked, and the battle began. The
Persian captains went behind their
wretched troops and scourged them on
to the fight with whips! Poor wretches,
they were driven on to be slaughtered,
pierced with the Greek spears, hurled
into the sea, or trampled into the mud of
the morass; but their inexhaustible numbers
told at length. The spears of the
Greeks broke under hard service, and
their swords alone remained; they began
to fall, and Leonidas himself was among
the first of the slain. Hotter than ever
was the fight over his corpse, and two
Persian princes, brothers of Xerxes, were
there killed; but at length word was
brought that Hydarnes was over the
pass, and that the few remaining men
were thus enclosed on all sides. The
Spartans and Thespians made their way
to a little hillock within the wall, resolved
to let this be the place of their last stand;
but the hearts of the Thebans failed
them, and they came towards the Persians
holding out their hands in entreaty
for mercy. Quarter was given to them,
but they were all branded with the king's
mark as untrustworthy deserters. The
helots probably at this time escaped into
the mountains; while the small desperate
band stood side by side on the hill still
fighting to the last, some with swords,
others with daggers, others even with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
their hands and teeth, till not one living
man remained amongst them when the
sun went down. There was only a
mound of slain, bristled over with
arrows.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand Persians had died
before that handful of men! Xerxes
asked Demaratus if there were many
more at Sparta like these, and was told
there were 8,000. It must have been
with a somewhat failing heart that he
invited his courtiers from the fleet to see
what he had done to the men who dared
to oppose him, and showed them the
head and arm of Leonidas set up upon a
cross; but he took care that all his own
slain, except 1,000, should first be put
out of sight. The body of the brave
king was buried where he fell, as were
those of the other dead. Much envied
were they by the unhappy Aristodemus,
who found himself called by no name but
the "Coward," and was shunned by all
his fellow-citizens. No one would give
him fire or water, and after a year of
misery, he redeemed his honor by perishing
in the forefront of the battle of
Plat&aelig;a, which was the last blow that
drove the Persians ingloriously from
Greece.</p>

<p>The Greeks then united in doing honor
to the brave warriors who, had they been
better supported, might have saved the
whole country from invasion. The poet
Simonides wrote the inscriptions that
were engraved upon the pillars that were
set up in the pass to commemorate this
great action. One was outside the wall,
where most of the fighting had been.
It seems to have been in honor of the
whole number who had for two days
resisted&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Here did four thousand men from Pelops' land<br />
Against three hundred myriads bravely stand."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>In honor of the Spartans was another
column&mdash;</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Go, traveler, to Sparta tell<br />
That here, obeying her, we fell."<br />
</div>

<p>On the little hillock of the last resistance
was placed the figure of a stone lion,
in memory of Leonidas, so fitly named
the lion-like; and Simonides, at his own
expense, erected a pillar to his friend, the
seer Megistias&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The great Megistias' tomb you here may view,<br />
Who slew the Medes, fresh from Spercheius fords;<br />
Well the wise seer the coming death foreknew,<br />
Yet scorn'd he to forsake his Spartan lords."<br />
</div>

<p>The names of the 300 were likewise
engraven on a pillar at Sparta.</p>

<p>Lion, pillars, and inscriptions have all
long since passed away, even the very
spot itself has changed; new soil has been
formed, and there are miles of solid
ground between Mount Oeta and the
gulf, so that the Hot Gates no longer
exist. But more enduring than stone
or brass&mdash;nay, than the very battle-field
itself&mdash;has been the name of Leonidas.
Two thousand three hundred years have
sped since he braced himself to perish
for his country's sake in that narrow,
marshy coast road, under the brow of the
wooded crags, with the sea by his side.
Since that time how many hearts have
glowed, how many arms have been
nerved at the remembrance of the Pass
of Thermopylae, and the defeat that was
worth so much more than a victory!</p>

<h2>SECTION XII. HOME READING LIST AND GENERAL INDEX</h2>

<h3>A HOME READING LIST</h3>


<p>Children are such omnivorous readers that teachers and parents are constantly
at their wit's end, not only in naming enough books to supply their demands, but in
grouping these books according to the order of difficulty. Most public libraries can
furnish such lists based upon their experience with children. In fact no modern public
library can carry on its work successfully without an especially prepared librarian
in charge of the books for children. The arrangement of any list by grades must at
best be only approximate, but if done in the light of a wide experience may be of the
greatest practical help to the young teacher or to the parent. The following list is
one issued by the Chicago Public Library, and is used here through the great kindness
of Miss Adah F. Whitcomb, supervisor of the children's room and director of
the training class. Any well-selected collection for children will contain a large
proportion of these titles, and the list is extended enough and varied enough to
furnish attractive reading material for any young person. At need it may be supplemented
by the more elaborate lists found in some of the guides mentioned in the
General Bibliography (<a href="#Page_2">p. 2</a>).</p>

at the command of his country.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One word as to
thy comparison of military and commercial persons.
What manner of men be they who have supplied the
Caffres with the firearms and ammunition to maintain their
savage and deplorable wars? Assuredly they are not
military.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cease then, if thou wouldst be counted
among the just, to vilify soldiers" (W. Napier, <i>Lieutenant-General</i>,
November, 1851). [Author's Note.]</p></div>

<p>Obvious punctuation errors repaired.</p>

<p>Both Mulock and Muloch were used for reference to the same person. An internet search shows
both usages as well so this was retained.</p>

<p>Both Aesop and Æsop were used in this text in various forms. This was retained.</p>

<p>Amongst the varied stories, many words were hyphenated or not. For example, both "today" and "to-day"
appear in this book. This usage has been retained.</p>
